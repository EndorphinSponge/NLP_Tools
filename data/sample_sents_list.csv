"Both uGRS (uGRS4 OR = 1.43, p = 0.071; uGRS6 OR = 8.39, p = 0.008) and wGRS (wGRS4 OR = 8.39, p = 0.001; wGRS6 OR = 6.09, p < 0.001) predicted PTS risk.","Total power, LF, HF, and BRS were all significantly depressed in patients with GOSE score <5","The autonomic variables predicted the late neurological outcome with areas under the receiver-operating curves between 0.78 and 0.83 (sensitivity: 0.63 to 0.88 and specificity: 0.73 to 0.82).","Multivariate analysis in patients with evacuated mass lesions showed that GCS (>=6 pts), and hypothermia were independent factors related to a favorable outcome.","A10398G was associated with DRS at 6 and 12 months (p=0.02) and a significant time by SNP interaction for DRS was found (p=0.0013).","There was a T195C by sex interaction for GOS (p=0.03) with the T195 allele associated with poorer outcomes in females","For association with outcome 3 months after injury, neither biomarker had adequate sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.65-0.74, for GFAP, and 0.59-0.80 for UCH-L1, depending upon Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOS-E] threshold used)","Biomarkers with the greatest predictive value for poor status at 72 hours included serum S-100B on admission, as well as plasma D-dimer and serum S-100B at 24 hours, for which, associations were strongly significant.","After correction for education and age distribution, the variables that are commonly associated with mortality or Glasgow Outcome Scale including admission pupils' examination, Marshal CT Classification, GCS, and serum glucose showed a limited predictive power for long-term cognitive prognosis.","Early ECF [NO x ] (<48 h post TBI) were significantly higher in non-survivors (median 59.2 mumol/l, n = 7) compared to survivors (23.3 mumol/l, n = 4) (P = 0.04). Late (48-96 h) ECF [NO x ] remained higher in non-survivors (47.9 mumol/l) compared to survivors (23.0 mumol/l) but this was not significant (P = 0.29).","Receiver operator characteristic analysis shows an optimized cutoff level for ECF [NO x ] of 26.5 mumol/l measured <48 h post TBI for predicting non-survival (sensitivity 100%, specificity 75%).","Plato waves did not predict bad outcomes.","ICP values below 20 mmHg were associated with a significantly lower risk of death of an individual patient at particular time.","Accordingly, cerebral perfusion pressure values above 70 mmHg during 0-2 days were associated with a significantly higher long-term survival.","Age <=40 was found to be a strong predictor of favourable outcome at follow-up (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.41 25.00, p=0.015).","The GOS at hospital discharge was not a predictor for severe impairments in any of the 9 different neuropsychological domains (all p-values were p>0.268).","In contrast, the GOS at rehabilitation discharge was found to be a predictor of severe impairments at follow-up in all but one domain assessed (all p-values less than p<0.038).","Factors independently associated with WOC were advanced age, pupillary reactivity, lower intensive care unit-length-of-stay, pre- and in-hospital cardiac arrest, herniation, intracranial pressure crisis, and pre-existing endocrine disease.","A linear regression determined that the MoCA, the MMSE, TBI severity, education level and presence of diffuse injuries predicted 57% of the total variability of the DRS scores.","A linear regression determined that the MoCA, the MMSE, TBI severity, education level and presence of diffuse injuries predicted 57% of the total variability of the DRS scores.","Regardless of BAL, older age, male gender, severe Glasgow Coma Scale score (<9), abnormal pupil, IVB and lesion on genu of corpus callosum were significantly related to disability.","The CSF endostatin concentration in 12 patients with an unfavorable outcome was significantly higher than that in 18 patients with a favorable outcome at day 5 (P = 0.043) and day 7 (P = 0.005) after trauma.","Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested a reliable operating point for the 7-day CSF endostatin concentration predicting poor prognosis to be 67.29 pg/mL.","Presence of coagulopathy, anticoagulant drug use, GCS of 13-14 and increased age predicted further deterioration","Among different haematoma types, only SDH predicted a worse outcome.","Patients with a PCS >= 6 had a 3.142 and 8.065 times higher odds of mortality and poor outcome compared with patients with a PCS <6, respectively.","Any one-score increase of the TTS had a 1.193 times higher odds of a poor outcome (p = 0.017).","Admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen, and D-dimer (>2 mg/L) and DIC scores (>= 5) showed an independent predictive effect on poor outcome.","In addition, there was some evidence that higher lesion volume, for both SWI and FLAIR, were associated with poorer memory as well as processing speed impairment.","Patients in the preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel cohort were more likely to have an unfavorable outcome (16/27; 59.3%; 95% confidence interval, 40.7%-77.8%) as compared with those without (18/50; 36.0%; 95% confidence interval, 22.7%-49.3%) (P = .05).","Employment status at follow-up was strongly correlated with both FAVRES Total Accuracy scores (r = 0.833) and Total Rationale scores (r = 0.837), but there were no correlations with FAVRES Time and Reasoning scores or with the LCQ.","Among initial severity measures, only the IMPACT prognostic score was significantly related to GOSE in univariate analyses, while measures relating to early evolution were more significant predictors.","In multivariate analyses, independent predictors of GOSE were length of stay in intensive care (LOS), age and education.","Independent predictors of employment were LOS and age.","Multivariate analysis showed that bilateral unresponsive mydriasis at admission and serum S100B at 24 h post-admission had odds ratios (ORs) of 21.35 (p=0.005) and 4.9 (p=0.010), respectively."
