Prognostic influence and magnetic resonance imaging findings in paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Lv, Li-Quan; Hou, Li-Jun; Yu, Ming-Kun; Qi, Xiang-Qian; Chen, Huai-Rui; Chen, Ju-Xiang; Hu, Guo-Han; Luo, Chun; Lu, Yi-Cheng","Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a clinical syndrome affecting a subgroup of survivors of severe brain injury. In this study, the prevalence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presentation, influence on the clinical course in the intensive care unit (ICU), and effect on neurological recovery of PSH were prospectively surveyed in 87 patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cranial MRI was performed during the first 30 days after injury. The outcome was assessed according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). PSH occurred in 18.4% of patients, with a greater incidence among younger patients and those with lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores. Patients with PSH had more deep lesions as shown on cranial MRI, significantly longer ICU stays, and worse outcomes. PSH was shown to be common among patients with severe TBI who also had deep intraparenchymal lesions. The mechanism by which PSH influences patient outcomes has yet to be defined, but we believe that it may be mediated by diencephalic-mesencephalic dysfunction or disconnection.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,11,1945-50,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1391,21028988,#9498,Lv 2010,,maybe
Utility of diffusion tensor imaging in the acute stage of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury for detecting white matter lesions and predicting long-term cognitive function in adults.,"Matsushita, Makoto; Hosoda, Kohkichi; Naitoh, Yasuo; Yamashita, Haruo; Kohmura, Eiji","OBJECT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often impairs cognitive function. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging, a novel modality, permits evaluation of the effects of head trauma on white matter nerve fibers. The objectives of the current study were to investigate where the white matter injury following mild to moderate TBI is specifically located on DT imaging in the acute disease stage and to examine the relationship between the severity of the white matter lesion on DT imaging in the acute stage of TBI and future cognitive function in the chronic disease stage., METHODS: Twenty adult patients with mild to moderate TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score between 9 and 15) underwent conventional MR and DT imaging a median of 3.5 days after injury, and 27 matched healthy controls also underwent both imaging modalities. The patients with TBI were further subdivided into 2 groups, that is, mild and more severe TBI groups, based on clinical (mild or moderate TBI), CT (diffuse brain injury [DBI] I or II), or MR imaging (normal or pathological appearance) classification. Fractional anisotropies (FAs) were compared between patients and controls using the region of interest method. Regions of interest were located in 8 different areas including the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiata (CR), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), frontal white matter (FWM), and occipital white matter (OWM) of the periventricular white matter. Eleven patients with TBI also underwent neuropsychological testing, which included the Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and P300 testing in the chronic disease stage (median 364 days)., RESULTS: Region of interest analysis demonstrated significantly lower FA values in the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum in more severe TBI groups (moderate TBI on clinical classification, DBI II on CT classification, and pathological appearance on MR imaging classification) than in controls. A significant difference was also observed in the FA of the splenium between controls and the mild TBI group of the clinical classification. No significant difference was observed in the FA of the CR, ALIC, PLIC, FWM, and OWM between controls and any of the TBI groups of clinical or imaging classifications. No significant difference was observed in the FA of any regions between mild and more severe TBI groups of the clinical or imaging classifications. Multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant positive linear relationship between FA in the splenium and total IQ (r = 0.79, p = 0.004). A significant negative linear relationship between FA in the FWM and P300 latency was also observed (r = 0.62, p = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Fractional anisotropy reductions in the splenium and FWM in the acute stage of mild to moderate TBI may be a useful prognostic factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction.",2011,/,Journal of neurosurgery,115,1,130-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2011.2.JNS101547,21417709,#9295,Matsushita 2011,,maybe
Bimanual coordination and corpus callosum microstructure in young adults with traumatic brain injury: a diffusion tensor imaging study.,"Caeyenberghs, Karen; Leemans, Alexander; Coxon, James; Leunissen, Inge; Drijkoningen, David; Geurts, Monique; Gooijers, Jolien; Michiels, Karla; Sunaert, Stefan; Swinnen, Stephan P","Bimanual actions are ubiquitous in daily life. Many coordinated movements of the upper extremities rely on precise timing, which requires efficient interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum (CC). As the CC in particular is known to be vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI), furthering our understanding of its structure-function association is highly valuable for TBI diagnostics and prognosis. In this study, 21 young adults with TBI and 17 controls performed object manipulation tasks (insertion of pegs with both hands and bilateral daily life activities) and cognitive control tasks (i.e., switching maneuvers during spatially and temporally coupled bimanual circular motions). The structural organization of 7 specific subregions of the CC (prefrontal, premotor/supplementary motor, primary motor, primary sensory, parietal, temporal, and occipital) was subsequently investigated in these subjects with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Findings revealed that bimanual coordination was impaired in TBI patients as shown by elevated movement time values during daily life activities, a decreased number of peg insertions, and slower response times during the switching task. Furthermore, the DTI analysis demonstrated a significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in prefrontal, primary sensory, and parietal regions in TBI patients versus controls. Finally, multiple regression analyses showed evidence of the high specificity of callosal subregions accounting for the variance associated with performance of the different bimanual coordination tasks. Whereas disruption in commissural pathways between occipital areas played a role in performance on the clinical tests of bimanual coordination, deficits in the switching task were related to disrupted interhemispheric communication in prefrontal, sensory, and parietal regions. This study provides evidence that structural alterations of several subregional callosal fibers in adults with TBI are associated with differential behavioral manifestations of bimanual motor functioning.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,6,897-913,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1721,21501046,#9258,Caeyenberghs 2011,,maybe
Religion and spirituality in rehabilitation outcomes among individuals with traumatic brain injury.,"Waldron-Perrine, Brigid; Rapport, Lisa J; Hanks, Robin A; Lumley, Mark; Meachen, Sarah-Jane; Hubbarth, Paul","OBJECTIVE: The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury affect millions of Americans, many of whom report using religion and spirituality to cope. Little research, however, has investigated how various elements of the religious and spiritual belief systems affect rehabilitation outcomes. The present study sought to assess the use of specifically defined elements of religion and spirituality as psychosocial resources in a sample of traumatically brain injured adults., PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 88 adults with brain injury from 1 to 20 years post injury and their knowledgeable significant others (SOs). The majority of the participants with brain injury were male (76%), African American (75%) and Christian (76%)., MEASURES: Participants subjectively reported on their religious/spiritual beliefs and psychosocial resources as well as their current physical and psychological status. Significant others reported objective rehabilitation outcomes., ANALYSES: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to determine the proportion of variance in outcomes accounted for by demographic, injury related, psychosocial and religious/spiritual variables., RESULTS: The results indicate that religious well-being (a sense of connection to a higher power) was a unique predictor for life satisfaction, distress and functional ability whereas public religious practice and existential well-being were not., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this project indicate that specific facets of religious and spiritual belief systems do play direct and unique roles in predicting rehabilitation outcomes whereas religious activity does not.

The association between apolipoprotein E and traumatic brain injury severity and functional outcome in a rehabilitation sample.,"Ponsford, Jennie; McLaren, Anna; Schonberger, Michael; Burke, Richard; Rudzki, Dion; Olver, John; Ponsford, Michael","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in significant disability, but outcome is variable. The impact of known predictors accounts for a limited proportion of the variance in outcomes. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype has been investigated as an additional source of variability in injury severity and outcome, with mixed findings reflecting variable methodology and generally limited sample sizes. This study aimed to examine whether possession of the ApoE e4 allele was associated with greater acute injury severity and poorer long-term outcome in patients referred for rehabilitation following TBI. ApoE genotype was determined for 648 patients with TBI, who were prospectively followed up a mean of 1.9 years post-injury. Hypotheses that e4 carriers would have lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and longer post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration were not supported. Prediction of worse Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) scores for e4 carriers was supported with greater susceptibility seen in females. These results indicate the ApoE e4 allele may be associated with poorer long-term outcome, but not acute injury severity. Possible mechanisms include differential effects of the e4 allele on inflammatory and cellular repair processes, and/or amyloid deposition.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,9,1683-92,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1623,21651315,#9204,Ponsford 2011,,maybe
Suicidal ideation following traumatic brain injury: prevalence rates and correlates in adults living in the community.,"Tsaousides, Theodore; Cantor, Joshua B; Gordon, Wayne A","OBJECTIVE: To explore the rates of suicidal ideation (SI) in a sample of community-dwelling adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess the relationship between SI and demographic and injury characteristics, pre- and postinjury psychiatric history, and psychosocial functioning., PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from a cohort study focused on health, psychosocial functioning, and community integration post-TBI (N = 356). Participants were individuals with mild to severe TBI living in the community., MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to assess SI. Psychiatric functioning was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) Axis I disorders (SCID-I), and psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Life-3, the Flanagan Scale of Unmet Needs, and the Bigelow Quality of Life Questionnaire., RESULTS: There were no differences in SI endorsement based on gender, age, race, income, education, injury severity, or length of time since injury. Those who met current criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder reported SI more frequently. Those with SI reported significantly lower psychosocial functioning., CONCLUSION: Individuals with TBI from all demographic groups and with injuries of varying severity are at risk for SI and thus for emotional distress and suicidal behavior. Screening for SI is indicated in all individuals with TBI, particularly those with a history of premorbid substance misuse and concurrent mood and anxiety disorders.

Premorbid statin use is associated with improved survival and functional outcomes in older head-injured individuals.,"Schneider, Eric B; Efron, David T; MacKenzie, Ellen J; Rivara, Frederick P; Nathens, Avery B; Jurkovich, Gregory J","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preinjury statin use is associated with survival and functional recovery in older adult victims of moderate/severe head trauma., METHODS: Using the National Study of Costs and Outcomes of Trauma dataset compiled from 69 US hospitals, the effect of preinjury statin use was assessed for in-hospital mortality and functional outcome in patients aged >=65 with head injury Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS)>=3. Individuals dying within 24 hours of admission or presenting with fixed dilated pupils were excluded. The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, dichotomized at the ability to return to premorbid major activity, was used to measure functional outcome. Multivariate regression modeled statin use and outcomes controlling for demographic, comorbidity, and injury characteristics., RESULTS: Of 523 eligible individuals, 117 (22%) used statins at the time of injury. Statin use was associated with a 76% lower adjusted risk of in-hospital death (relative risk [RR]=0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.69). Of 395 individuals discharged alive, 303 survived 1 year and 264 had complete Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Statin users and nonusers demonstrated similar risk of good recovery at 3 months (RR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.46-1.49). At 12 months postinjury, statin users had 13% higher likelihood of good recovery (RR=1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26). The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities abrogated this effect., CONCLUSION: Preinjury statin use in older adult traumatic brain injury victims is associated with reduced risk of death and improved functional recovery at 12 months postinjury. Individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities lose this benefit of premorbid statin use.

Risk of death remained elevated above societal norms for at least 8 years after discharge from rehabilitation. Mortality risk was increased by: functional dependence at discharge; age at injury; pre-injury drug and alcohol misuse; pre-injury epilepsy; and discharge to an aged care facility. The risk of death from external causes, and respiratory system and nervous system disorders was six to seven times higher, and the risk of death from disorders of the digestive system, and mental and behavioural disorders was five times higher in adults with severe TBI than in the general population., CONCLUSIONS: People who survive to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation following a severe TBI were found to have a sustained increase in risk of death for eight years post discharge.

Rehabilitation LOS was significantly correlated with acute-care LOS (P=0.001) and Glasgow Coma Scale, but not with patients' age (P=0.250) or sex (P= 0.348). Rehabilitation LOS was significantly correlated with functional and cognitive admission outcome scores but not with gains during rehabilitation. Rehabilitation LOS was significantly less in the group of patients that returned back home respect to others. Regression analysis also illustrated that longer acute-care LOS was independently associated with significantly increased rehabilitation LOS (P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that rehabilitation LOS in TBI patients is correlated with timing of and score at admission to the rehabilitation setting rather than with gains in functional outcome., CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This result may help to optimize inpatient service utilization, especially in term of LOS.",2012,/,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,48,3,433-41,,,22820827,#8694,Avesani 2012,,maybe

We sought to investigate the independent relationship between hyperoxemia and long-term mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium database was screened for mechanically ventilated patients with a moderate-to-severe TBI. Patients were categorized, according to the highest measured alveolar-arterial O2 gradient or the lowest measured PaO2 value during the first 24 hours of ICU admission, to hypoxemia (<10.0 kPa), normoxemia (10.0 to 13.3 kPa) and hyperoxemia (>13.3 kPa). We adjusted for markers of illness severity to evaluate the independent relationship between hyperoxemia and 6-month mortality., RESULTS: A total of 1,116 patients were included in the study, of which 16% (n = 174) were hypoxemic, 51% (n = 567) normoxemic and 33% (n = 375) hyperoxemic. The total 6-month mortality was 39% (n = 435). A significant association between hyperoxemia and a decreased risk of mortality was found in univariate analysis (P = 0.012). However, after adjusting for markers of illness severity in a multivariate logistic regression model hyperoxemia showed no independent relationship with 6-month mortality (hyperoxemia vs. normoxemia OR 0.88, 95% CI 0. 63 to 1.22, P = 0.43; hyperoxemia vs. hypoxemia OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50, P = 0.90)., CONCLUSION: Hyperoxemia in the first 24 hours of ICU admission after a moderate-to-severe TBI is not predictive of 6-month mortality.",2013,/,"Critical care (London, England)",17,4,R177,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc12856,23958227,#8122,Raj 2013,,maybe

A retrospective review of swallow dysfunction in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Mandaville, Amy; Ray, Anjea; Robertson, Henry; Foster, Careen; Jesser, Christine","In the acute-care setting, it is difficult for clinicians to determine which patients with severe traumatic brain injury will have long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia (>6 weeks) and which patients will begin oral nutrition quickly. Patients frequently remain in the acute-care setting while physicians determine whether to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. To improve the acute-care clinician's ability to predict long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia and subsequent need for PEG tube placement in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) <= 8), a novel prediction model was created utilizing clinical information and acute-care swallowing evaluation findings. Five years of retrospective data were obtained from trauma patients at a Level 1 trauma hospital. Of the 375 patients who survived their hospitalization with a GCS <= 8, a total of 269 patients received Ranchos Los Amigos (RLA) scores. Of those patients who were scored for RLA, 219 patients underwent swallowing evaluation. Ninety-six of the 219 patients were discharged from the hospital with a feeding tube, and 123 patients were discharged without one. Logistic regression models examined the association between clinical and patient characteristics and whether a patient with severe traumatic brain injury exhibited long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age, low RLA score, tracheostomy tube placement, and aphonia observed on the initial swallowing evaluation significantly increased the odds of being discharged from the acute-care hospital with a feeding tube.

Predictors of intensive care unit length of stay and intracranial pressure in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Lazaridis, Christos; Yang, Ming; DeSantis, Stacia M; Luo, Sheng T; Robertson, Claudia S","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship of intracranial pressure (ICP) with intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay in a large cohort of severe traumatic brain injury patients and identify factors associating with prolonged ICU course., METHODS: This was a single-center database review of de-identified research data that had been prospectively collected; setting: neurosurgical ICU, Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston, TX., RESULTS: In a cohort of 438 severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, 149 (34%) had a motor Glasgow Coma Scale score of 1 to 3 on admission and 284 (65%) had 4 to 5. Intracranial pressure during the ICU course was 19.8+/-11.2 mm Hg. Favorable outcome was obtained in 148 (34%), and unfavorable, in 211 (48%) patients with a mortality of 28%. ICU length of stay (LOS) was 19.4+/-13.9 days. Joint modeling of ICP and ICU LOS was undertaken, adjusted for the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI admission prognostic indicators. A higher ICP was not significantly associated with longer ICU LOS (P=.4). However, presence of a mass lesion on admission head computed tomography was strongly correlated with a prolonged ICU LOS (P=.0007). Diffuse injuries with basal cistern compression or midline shift were marginally associated with a longer ICU LOS (P=.053)., CONCLUSIONS: ICP, as monitored and managed according to BTF guidelines, is not associated with ICU length of stay.

Posttraumatic parkinsonism would increase the mortality risk in elderly patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Harnod, Dorji; Yen, Yu-Shu; Lin, Cheng-Li; Harnod, Tomor; Kao, Chia-Hung","Background: We used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to determine whether patients who develop posttraumatic parkinsonism (PTP) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) have an increased mortality risk., Methods: We analyzed data from the NHIRD of patients aged >=20 years who had received a diagnosis of and admitted for head injury with TBI (ICD-9-CM 850-854, 959.01) from 2000 to 2012. The TBI cohort was further divided into PTP and posttraumatic non-parkinsonism (PTN) cohorts and compared against a sex-, age-, comorbidity-, and index-date-matched comparison cohort. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause mortality risk in these cohorts after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities., Results: There were 23,504 and 744 patients enrolled in the PTN cohort and the PTP cohort. Subsequent parkinsonism happened with an incidence of 3.07% in patients with TBI, and 11.59% in those aged over 65 years. The PTP cohort (aHR =1.67, 95% CI: 1.47-1.90) other than PTN (aHR =1.37, 95% CI: 1.29-1.45) cohort had a higher risk of mortality. In ones aged 65-74 years (aHR =2.08, 95% CI: 1.41-3.07), there was a more increased mortality risk in patients with PTP when compared to the PTN cohort., Conclusions: PTP would increase the long-term mortality risk of patients with TBI, especially in whom aged 65-74 years.

Behavioural problems in the first year after Severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective multicentre study.,"Nygren DeBoussard, Catharina; Lannsjo, Marianne; Stenberg, Maud; Stalnacke, Britt-Marie; Godbolt, Alison K","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of behavioural problems in patients with severe traumatic brain injury during the first year after injury and potential associations with outcome. An additional post hoc objective was to analyse the frequency of behaviours with need for intervention from staff., DESIGN AND SETTING: In a prospective population based cohort study 114 patients with severe traumatic brain injury were assessed at three weeks, three months and one year after injury., MAIN MEASURES: Assessments included clinical examination and standardised instruments. Agitation was assessed with the Agitated Behaviour Scale, the course of recovery by the Rancho Los Amigo Scale and outcome by Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: Agitation were most common at 3 weeks post injury and 28% ( n=68) of the patients showed at least one agitated behaviour requiring intervention from staff. Presence of significant agitation at 3 weeks after injury was not associated with poor outcome. At 3 months agitation was present in 11% ( n=90) and apathy in 26 out of 81 assessed patients. At 3 months agitation and apathy were associated with poor outcome at one year., CONCLUSIONS: Most agitated behaviours in the early phase are transient and are not associated with poor outcome. Agitation and apathy are uncommon at three months but when present are associated with poor outcome at one year after injury.

The impact of direct oral anticoagulants in traumatic brain injury patients greater than 60-years-old.,"Prexl, Oliver; Bruckbauer, Martin; Voelckel, Wolfgang; Grottke, Oliver; Ponschab, Martin; Maegele, Marc; Schochl, Herbert","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death among trauma patients. Patients under antithrombotic therapy (ATT) carry an increased risk for intracranial haematoma (ICH) formation. There is a paucity of data about the role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) among TBI patients., METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated all TBI patients >=60-years-old who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2014 until May 2017. Patients were grouped into those receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKA), platelet inhibitors (PI), DOACs and no antithrombotic therapy (no-ATT)., RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-six, predominantly male (52.7%) TBI patients with a median age of 79 years (range: 70-85 years) were enrolled in the study. Glasgow Coma Scale and S-100beta were not different among the groups. Patients on VKA and DOACs had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index compared to the PI group and no-ATT group (p = 0.0021). The VKA group received reversal agents significantly more often than the other groups (p < 0.0001). Haematoma progression in the follow-up cranial computed tomography (CCT) was lowest in the DOAC group. The number of CCT and surgical interventions were low with no differences between the groups. No relevant differences in ICU and hospital length of stay were observed. Mortality in the VKA group was significantly higher compared to DOAC, PI and no-ATT group (p = 0.047)., DISCUSSION: Data from huge registry studies displayed higher efficacy and lower fatal bleeding rates for DOACs compared to VKAs. The current study revealed comparable results. Despite the fact that TBI patients on VKAs received reversal agents more often than patients on DOACs (84.4% vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001), mortality rate was significantly higher in the VKA group (p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: In patients >=60 years suffering from TBI, anticoagulation with DOACs appears to be safer than with VKA. Anti-thrombotic therapy with VKA resulted in a worse outcome compared to DOACs and PI.

Frequency and prognostic factors of olfactory dysfunction after traumatic brain injury.,"Bratt, Mette; Skandsen, Toril; Hummel, Thomas; Moen, Kent G; Vik, Anne; Nordgard, Stale; Helvik, Anne-S","OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and factors associated with posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction, including anosmia, in a follow-up of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: The setting was a cross-sectional study of patients that were consecutively included in the Trondheim TBI database, comprising injury-related variables. Eligible participants 18-65 years were contacted 9-104 months post trauma and asked olfactory-related questions. Those reporting possible posttraumatic change of olfaction were invited to further examination using the Sniffin' Sticks panel., RESULTS: Of 211 eligible participants, 182 (86.3%) took part in telephone interviews and 25(13.7%) were diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction. 60% of these, or 8.2% of all participants, had anosmia.

Disability Rating Scale in the First Few Weeks After a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury as a Predictor of 6-Month Functional Outcome.,"Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Aisiku, Imoigele P; Hannay, H Julia; Brito, Frances A; Robertson, Claudia S","BACKGROUND: An early acute marker of long-term neurological outcome would be useful to help guide clinical decision making and therapeutic effectiveness after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We investigated the utility of the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) as early as 1 wk after TBI as a predictor of favorable 6-mo Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOS-E)., OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictability of a favorable 6-mo GOS-E using the DRS measured during weeks 1 to 4 of injury., METHODS: The study is a sub analysis of patients enrolled in the Epo Severe TBI Trial (n = 200) to train and validate L1-regularized logistic regression models. DRS was collected at weeks 1 to 4 and GOS-E at 6 mo., RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.82 for the model with baseline demographic and injury severity variables and week 1 DRS and increased to 0.88 when including weekly DRS until week 4., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that week 1 to 4 DRS may be predictors of favorable 6-mo outcome in severe TBI patients and thus useful both for clinical prognostication as well as surrogate endpoints for adaptive clinical trials.

Cognitive Event-Related Potentials during the Sub-Acute Phase of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury and Their Relationship to Outcome.,"Hauger, Solveig L; Olafsen, Kjell; Schnakers, Caroline; Andelic, Nada; Nilsen, Kristian Bernhard; Helseth, Eirik; Funderud, Ingrid; Andersson, Stein; Schanke, Anne-Kristine; Lovstad, Marianne","Predicting outcome in the early phase after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a major clinical challenge, particularly identifying patients with potential for good cognitive outcome. The current single-center prospective study aimed to explore presence and normalization of electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potentials (ERPs) in the early phase followings TBI, and their relationship to functional and cognitive outcome 6 months post-injury. Fourteen adult patients (eight males) with sTBI were recruited from the neurointensive care unit (mean age = 38.2 years [standard deviation (SD) = 14.7]; mean lowest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score within first 24 h = 5.4, SD = 1.87). EEG recordings were conducted biweekly at three time-points applying an ERP paradigm encompassing a passive condition involving hearing their own name randomly interspersed between an unfamiliar name (UN), and an active condition with instruction to count their own name. Functional and cognitive outcome 6 months post-injury was measured with Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and neuropsychological tests of attention and memory. Ten patients demonstrated a significantly enhanced cognitive P3 in the active counting task compared with passive listening across recordings, and six presented with normalization of P3 in the counting task. Moreover, P3 amplitude to the counting task at the third time-point was positively correlated with both functional outcome (GOSE) and cognition (verbal learning, attentional set-shifting, and switching) 6 months post-injury. ERP can index cognitive capacities in the early phase following sTBI, and the cognitive P3 component in an active design is associated with functional and cognitive outcome, demonstrating that the cognitive P3 may yield valuable information of residual cognition and provide supplementary prognostic information.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,22,3124-3133,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5062,28594285,#6129,Hauger 2017,,yes
"Differential effects of the Glasgow Coma Scale Score and its Components: An analysis of 54,069 patients with traumatic brain injury.","Reith, Florence C M; Lingsma, Hester F; Gabbe, Belinda J; Lecky, Fiona E; Roberts, Ian; Maas, Andrew I R","INTRODUCTION: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is widely used in the assessment of clinical severity and prediction of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The sum score is frequently applied, but the differential influence of the components infrequently addressed. We aimed to investigate the contribution of the GCS components to the sum score, floor and ceiling effects of the components, and their prognostic effects., METHODS: Data on adult TBI patients were gathered from three data repositories: TARN (n=50,064), VSTR (n=14,062), and CRASH (n=9,941). Data on initial hospital GCS-assessment and discharge mortality were extracted. A descriptive analysis was performed to identify floor and ceiling effects. The relation between GCS and outcome was studied by comparing case fatality rates (CFR) between different component-profiles adding up to identical sum scores using Chi2-tests, and by quantifying the prognostic value of each component and sum score with Nagelkerke's R2 derived from logistic regression analyses across TBI severities., RESULTS: In the range 3-7, the sum score is primarily determined by the motor component, as the verbal and eye components show floor-effects at sum scores 7 and 8, respectively. In the range 8-12, the effect of the motor component attenuates and the verbal and eye components become more relevant. The motor, eye and verbal scores reach their ceiling-effects at sum 13, 14 and 15, respectively. Significant variations were exposed in CFR between different component-profiles despite identical sum scores, except in sum scores 6 and 7. Regression analysis showed that the motor score had highest R2 values in severe TBI patients, whereas the other components were more relevant at higher sum scores. The prognostic value of the three components combined was consistently higher than that of the sum score alone., CONCLUSION: The GCS-components contribute differentially across the spectrum of consciousness to the sum score, each having floor and ceiling effects. The specific component-profile is related to outcome and the three components combined contain higher prognostic value than the sum score across different TBI severities. We, therefore, recommend a multidimensional use of the three-component GCS both in clinical practice, and in prognostic studies. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Age-related outcome of patients after traumatic brain injury: a single-center observation.,"Erlebach, Rolf; Pagnamenta, Alberto; Klinzing, Stephanie; Stretti, Federica; Cottini, Silvia; Schupbach, Reto; Steiger, Peter; Brandi, Giovanna","BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to analyze clinical features of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), their age-related outcomes and determinants of long-term outcome., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a level I University Swiss trauma center. Consecutive patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted for more than 48 hours to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients' and trauma characteristics, management during ICU stay, prognostic scores and long-term outcomes were analyzed., RESULTS: Hundred-seventy-four patients (72% males, mean age 49 years) were divided in three age groups: young (<=39 years, N.=69, 39.7%), middle aged (40-64 years, N.=55, 31.6%), and elderly (>=65 years, N.=50, 28.7%). In elderly patients, falls (62%) were the most common cause of TBI. Overall ICU mortality was 15% with no difference among age groups. Within six-months after TBI, 80% of elderly patients presented unfavorable outcomes. Age, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents, abnormal pupillary reactivity, a high score in Marshall CT classification, and a higher glucose level were associated with unfavorable outcomes in a univariable logistic regression. In a multivariable logistic regression, age and abnormal pupillary reactivity were identified as independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes, while presence of epidural hematoma and higher hemoglobin levels were predictors for favorable outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients are at higher risk for long-term unfavorable outcomes than younger patients.

Early predictors of outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (UPFRONT): an observational cohort study.,"van der Naalt, Joukje; Timmerman, Marieke E; de Koning, Myrthe E; van der Horn, Harm J; Scheenen, Myrthe E; Jacobs, Bram; Hageman, Gerard; Yilmaz, Tansel; Roks, Gerwin; Spikman, Jacoba M","BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for most cases of TBI, and many patients show incomplete long-term functional recovery. We aimed to create a prognostic model for functional outcome by combining demographics, injury severity, and psychological factors to identify patients at risk for incomplete recovery at 6 months. In particular, we investigated additional indicators of emotional distress and coping style at 2 weeks above early predictors measured at the emergency department., METHODS: The UPFRONT study was an observational cohort study done at the emergency departments of three level-1 trauma centres in the Netherlands, which included patients with mTBI, defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15 and either post-traumatic amnesia lasting less than 24 h or loss of consciousness for less than 30 min. Emergency department predictors were measured either on admission with mTBI-comprising injury severity (GCS score, post-traumatic amnesia, and CT abnormalities), demographics (age, gender, educational level, pre-injury mental health, and previous brain injury), and physical conditions (alcohol use on the day of injury, neck pain, headache, nausea, dizziness)-or at 2 weeks, when we obtained data on mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List), and post-traumatic complaints. The functional outcome was recovery, assessed at 6 months after injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomised recovery into complete (GOSE=8) and incomplete (GOSE<=7) recovery. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the predictive value of patient information collected at the time of admission to an emergency department (eg, demographics, injury severity) alone, and combined with predictors of outcome collected at 2 weeks after injury (eg, emotional distress and coping)., FINDINGS: Between Jan 25, 2013, and Jan 6, 2015, data from 910 patients with mTBI were collected 2 weeks after injury; the final date for 6-month follow-up was July 6, 2015. Of these patients, 764 (84%) had post-traumatic complaints and 414 (45%) showed emotional distress. At 6 months after injury, outcome data were available for 671 patients; complete recovery (GOSE=8) was observed in 373 (56%) patients and incomplete recovery (GOSE <=7) in 298 (44%) patients. Logistic regression analyses identified several predictors for 6-month outcome, including education and age, with a clear surplus value of indicators of emotional distress and coping obtained at 2 weeks (area under the curve [AUC]=0.79, optimism 0.02; Nagelkerke R2=0.32, optimism 0.05) than only emergency department predictors at the time of admission (AUC=0.72, optimism 0.03; Nagelkerke R2=0.19, optimism 0.05)., INTERPRETATION: Psychological factors (ie, emotional distress and maladaptive coping experienced early after injury) in combination with pre-injury mental health problems, education, and age are important predictors for recovery at 6 months following mTBI.

However, periostin concentrations are undetermined in peripheral blood from patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, serum periostin concentrations were measured in 130 controls and 130 severe TBI patients. We investigated its association with trauma severity reflected by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and prognosis (i.e., 30-day mortality and 30-day overall survival)., RESULTS: As compared with the controls, serum periostin concentrations were significantly increased in the patients [(median, 246.5ng/ml; interquartile range, 164.5-328.6ng/ml) vs. (median, 61.8ng/ml; interquartile range, 37.9-77.9ng/ml), P<0.001]. Periostin concentrations independently correlated with GCS scores (t=-6.199, P<0.001). Serum periostin concentrations higher than 308.2ng/ml predicted 30-day mortality with a sensitivity of 72.4% and a specificity of 78.2% [area under curve, 815; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.737-0.878]. Periostin concentrations higher than 246.5ng/ml were independently related to 30-day mortality and 30-day overall survival with odds ratio value of 3.829 (95% CI, 1.104-13.281) and hazard ratio value of 5.667 (95% CI, 1.953-16.443) respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum periostin concentrations clearly reflect trauma severity and mortality following TBI.

Acute PTH (aPTH) is defined by new or worsening of pre-existing headache occurring within 7 days after trauma, whereas chronic PTH (cPTH) is defined as persisting aPTH >3 months after trauma. An additional goal was to study the impact of aPTH and cPTH in terms of return to work (RTW), anxiety and depression., METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted between January 2013 and February 2014 in three trauma centres in the Netherlands. Patients aged 16 years and older with a GCS score of 9-15 on admission to the ED, with loss of consciousness and/or amnesia were prospectively enrolled. Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 2 weeks and 3 months after injury with the Head Injury Symptom Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and RTW scale., RESULTS: In total, 628 patients were enrolled in the study, 469 completed the 2-week questionnaire (75%) at 2 weeks and 409 (65%) at 3 months. At 2 weeks, 238 (51%) had developed aPTH and at 3 months 95 (23%) had developed cPTH. Female gender, younger age, headache immediately at the ED and CT scan abnormalities increased the risk for aPTH. Risk factors for cPTH were female gender and headache at the ED. Patients with cPTH were less likely to have returned to work than those without cPTH (35% vs 14%, P=0.001). Patients with aPTH and cPTH more often report anxiety (20% and 28%, P=0.001) and depression (19% and 28%, P=0.001) after trauma in comparison with the group without PTH (10% anxiety and 8% depression)., CONCLUSIONS: PTH is an important health problem with a significant impact on long-term outcome of TBI patients. Several risk factors were identified, which can aid in early identification of subjects at risk for PTH.

Skeletal Muscle as a Factor Contributing to Better Stratification of Older Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Shibahashi, Keita; Sugiyama, Kazuhiro; Hoda, Hidenori; Hamabe, Yuichi","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older patients is becoming an increasing problem, and methods that help predict outcomes in this population are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate skeletal muscle mass as a predictive marker for TBI outcome in older patients., METHODS: Older patients (age >=60 years) with TBI were included in this study. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months postinjury. Patients were classified according to their GOS score as having a good outcome (GOS 3-5) or a poor outcome (GOS 1 OR 2). Skeletal muscle mass was estimated, and the relationship with outcome was analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to quantify the independent effects of sarcopenia on the risk of poor outcome., RESULTS: Seventy-four patients (median age, 74 years; 53 males) were included. Outcomes at 6 months postinjury were good in 38 patients and poor in 36 patients. The skeletal muscle area was significantly larger in the good outcome group compared with the poor outcome group (57.3 cm2 vs. 47.6 cm2; P < 0.001). The rate of poor outcome was significantly higher in the patients with sarcopenia compared with those without sarcopenia (0.70 vs. 0.24; relative risk, 2.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-5.64). The difference was statistically significant, and the odds ratio was 3.88 (95% CI, 1.14-13.2; P = 0.031)., CONCLUSION: Reduced skeletal muscle mass was associated with poorer outcome after TBI in our cohort of older patients. Our results suggest that identifying patients with low muscularity may contribute to better stratification in this population. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

[Magnetic resonance in traumatic brain injury: A comparative study of the different conventional magnetic resonance imaging sequences and their diagnostic value in diffuse axonal injury].,"Cicuendez, Marta; Castano-Leon, Ana; Ramos, Ana; Hilario, Amaya; Gomez, Pedro A; Lagares, Alfonso","OBJECTIVE: To compare the identification capability of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) by different sequences on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) studies in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retropectevely analyzed 264 TBI patients to whom a MR had been performed in the first 60 days after trauma. All clinical variables related to prognosis were registered, as well as the data from the initial computed tomography. The MR imaging protocol consisted of a 3-plane localizer sequence T1-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin-echo, FLAIR and gradient-echo images (GRET2*). TAI lesions were classified according to Gentry and Firsching classifications. We calculated weighted kappa coefficients and the area under the ROC curve for each MR sequence. A multivariable analyses was performed to correlate MR findings in each sequence with the final outcome of the patients., RESULTS: TAI lesions were adequately visualized on T2, FLAIR and GRET2* sequences in more than 80% of the studies. Subcortical TAI lesions were well on FLAIR and GRET2* sequences visualized hemorrhagic TAI lesions. We saw that these MR sequences had a high inter-rater agreement for TAI diagnosis (0.8). T2 sequence presented the highest value on ROC curve in Gentry (0.68, 95%CI: 0.61-0.76, p<0.001, Nagerlkerke-R2 0.26) and Firsching classifications (0.64, 95%CI 0.57-0.72, p<0.001, Nagerlkerke-R2 0.19), followed by FLAIR and GRET2* sequences. Both classifications determined by each of these sequences were associated with poor outcome after performing a multivariable analyses adjusted for prognostic factors (p<0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to perform conventional MR study in subacute phase including T2, FLAIR and GRET2* sequences for visualize TAI lesions. These MR findings added prognostic information in TBI patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Correlation of tenascin-C concentrations in serum with outcome of traumatic brain injury in humans.,"Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Lou, Lin; Yang, Kai-Chuang; Wang, Hai-Bo; Xu, Yan; Lu, Gang; He, Hai-Yan","BACKGROUND: Tenascin-C, a matricellular protein, is involved in brain injury. However, change of tenascin-C concentrations in peripheral blood remains unknown after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Serum tenascin-C concentrations were measured in 100 healthy controls, 108 severe TBI patients, 79 moderate TBI patients and 32 mild TBI patients., RESULTS: Serum tenascin-C concentrations of patients were significantly higher than those of controls. Tenascin-C concentrations negatively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores in all patients (r=-0.658, P<0.001). In severe TBI patients, tenascin-C in serum significantly discriminated patients at risk of 6-month mortality (area under curve, 0.821; 95% confidence interval, 0.735-0.888) and poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) (area under curve, 0.833; 95% confidence interval, 0.749-0.898) and emerged as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 1.114; 95% confidence interval, 1.008-1.233; P=0.005), overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.085; 95% confidence interval, 1.010-1.166; P=0.003) and unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.049; 95% confidence interval, 1.014-1.076; P=0.001). By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, serum tenascin-C concentrations had similar prognostic value compared with GCS scores., CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced serum tenascin-C concentrations are closely related to trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing tenascin-C as a potential prognostic biomarker after TBI.

The development of therapies for TBI is limited by the absence of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Microtubule-associated protein tau is an axonal phosphoprotein. To date, the presence of the hypophosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) in plasma from patients with acute TBI and chronic TBI has not been investigated., Objective: To examine the associations between plasma P-tau and total-tau (T-tau) levels and injury presence, severity, type of pathoanatomic lesion (neuroimaging), and patient outcomes in acute and chronic TBI., Design, Setting, and Participants: In the TRACK-TBI Pilot study, plasma was collected at a single time point from 196 patients with acute TBI admitted to 3 level I trauma centers (<24 hours after injury) and 21 patients with TBI admitted to inpatient rehabilitation units (mean [SD], 176.4 [44.5] days after injury). Control samples were purchased from a commercial vendor. The TRACK-TBI Pilot study was conducted from April 1, 2010, to June 30, 2012. Data analysis for the current investigation was performed from August 1, 2015, to March 13, 2017., Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma samples were assayed for P-tau (using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphothreonine-231) and T-tau using ultra-high sensitivity laser-based immunoassay multi-arrayed fiberoptics conjugated with rolling circle amplification., Results: In the 217 patients with TBI, 161 (74.2%) were men; mean (SD) age was 42.5 (18.1) years. The P-tau and T-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio in patients with acute TBI were higher than those in healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the 3 tau indices demonstrated accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) of 1.000, 0.916, and 1.000, respectively, for discriminating mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, 13-15, n = 162) from healthy controls. The P-tau level and P-tau-T-tau ratio were higher in individuals with more severe TBI (GCS, <=12 vs 13-15). The P-tau level and P-tau-T-tau ratio outperformed the T-tau level in distinguishing cranial computed tomography-positive from -negative cases (AUC = 0.921, 0.923, and 0.646, respectively). Acute P-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio weakly distinguished patients with TBI who had good outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended GOS-E, 7-8) (AUC = 0.663 and 0.658, respectively) and identified those with poor outcomes (GOS-E, <=4 vs >4) (AUC = 0.771 and 0.777, respectively). Plasma samples from patients with chronic TBI also showed elevated P-tau levels and a P-tau-T-tau ratio significantly higher than that of healthy controls, with both P-tau indices strongly discriminating patients with chronic TBI from healthy controls (AUC = 1.000 and 0.963, respectively)., Conclusions and Relevance: Plasma P-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio outperformed T-tau level as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for acute TBI.

"Evaluation of novel computerized tomography scoring systems in human traumatic brain injury: An observational, multicenter study.","Thelin, Eric Peter; Nelson, David W; Vehvilainen, Juho; Nystrom, Harriet; Kivisaari, Riku; Siironen, Jari; Svensson, Mikael; Skrifvars, Markus B; Bellander, Bo-Michael; Raj, Rahul","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the brain is essential for diagnostic screening of intracranial injuries in need of neurosurgical intervention, but may also provide information concerning patient prognosis and enable baseline risk stratification in clinical trials. Novel CT scoring systems have been developed to improve current prognostic models, including the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores, but so far have not been extensively validated. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores for predicting functional outcome, in comparison with the Rotterdam CT score and Marshall CT classification. The secondary aims were to assess which individual components of the CT scores best predict outcome and what additional prognostic value the CT scoring systems contribute to a clinical prognostic model., METHODS AND FINDINGS: TBI patients requiring neuro-intensive care and not included in the initial creation of the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scoring systems were retrospectively included from prospectively collected data at the Karolinska University Hospital (n = 720 from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014) and Helsinki University Hospital (n = 395 from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014), totaling 1,115 patients. The Marshall CT classification and the Rotterdam, Stockholm, and Helsinki CT scores were assessed using the admission CT scans. Known outcome predictors at admission were acquired (age, pupil responsiveness, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, glucose level, and hemoglobin level) and used in univariate, and multivariable, regression models to predict long-term functional outcome (dichotomizations of the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]). In total, 478 patients (43%) had an unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-3). In the combined cohort, overall prognostic performance was more accurate for the Stockholm CT score (Nagelkerke's pseudo-R2 range 0.24-0.28) and the Helsinki CT score (0.18-0.22) than for the Rotterdam CT score (0.13-0.15) and Marshall CT classification (0.03-0.05). Moreover, the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores added the most independent prognostic value in the presence of other known clinical outcome predictors in TBI (6% and 4%, respectively). The aggregate traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) component of the Stockholm CT score was the strongest predictor of unfavorable outcome. The main limitations were the retrospective nature of the study, missing patient information, and the varying follow-up time between the centers., CONCLUSIONS: The Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores provide more information on the damage sustained, and give a more accurate outcome prediction, than earlier classification systems. The strong independent predictive value of tSAH may reflect an underrated component of TBI pathophysiology. A change to these newer CT scoring systems may be warranted.",2017,/,PLoS medicine,14,8,e1002368,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002368,28771476,#6069,Thelin 2017,,yes
The impact of Glasgow Coma Scale-age prognosis score on geriatric traumatic brain injury outcomes.,"Khan, Muhammad; O'Keeffe, Terence; Jehan, Faisal; Kulvatunyou, Narong; Kattaa, Abdullah; Gries, Lynn; Tang, Andrew; Joseph, Bellal","BACKGROUND: As the population ages, increasing number of geriatric patients sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI). Communication of accurate prognostic information is crucial for making informed decisions on behalf of such patients. Therefore, the aim of our study was to develop a simple and clinically applicable tool that accurately predicts the prognosis in geriatric TBI patients., METHODS: We performed a 1-y (2011) retrospective analysis of isolated geriatric TBI patients (age >=65 y, head abbreviated injury score [AIS] >= 3, and other body AIS < 3) in the National Trauma Data Bank. We calculated a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-age prognosis (GAP) score (age/GCS score) for all patients. Outcome measures were in-hospital adverse outcomes (mortality and Rehab/skilled nursing facility discharge disposition). Regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were performed to determine the discriminatory power of GAP score., RESULTS: A total of 8750 geriatric patients with TBI were included. Mean age was 77.8 +/- 7.1 y, the median (interquartile range) GCS was 15 (13-15), and the median (interquartile range) head AIS was 4 (3-4). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.7%, and 34.2% of the patients were discharged home. As the GAP score increased, the mortality rate increased and discharge to-home decreased. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed excellent discriminatory power for mortality (area under the curve: 0.826). Above a GAP score of 12, the mortality rate was >50% and more than 45% of the patients were discharged to Rehab/skilled nursing facility., CONCLUSIONS: For geriatric patients with TBI, a simple GAP score reliably predicts outcomes. A score above 12 results in a drastic increase in mortality and an adverse discharge disposition. This simple tool may help clinicians provide accurate prognostic information to patients' families.

Models of Mortality and Morbidity in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: An Analysis of a Singapore Neurotrauma Database.,"Han, Julian Xinguang; See, Angela An Qi; Gandhi, Mihir; King, Nicolas Kon Kam","OBJECTIVE: Current prognostic models for traumatic brain injury (TBI) are developed from diverse historical data sets. We aimed to construct a prognostication tool for patients with severe TBI, as this group would benefit most from an accurate model., METHODS: Model development was based on a cohort of 300 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <=8) consecutively admitted to a neurosurgical intensive care unit at the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), Singapore, between February 2006 and December 2009. We analyzed prospectively collected data of admission characteristics using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to predict 14-day and 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome. Comparison with Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) and Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) models was done using Akaike information criterion., RESULTS: Two prediction models, NNI Clinical (age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupillary reactivity) and NNI+ (NNI Clinical model with addition of obliteration of third ventricle or basal cisterns, presence of subdural hemorrhage, hypoxia, and coagulopathy), were derived from this data set. Both models predicted well across 3 outcome measures with area under the curve values of 0.84-0.91, with adequate calibration. Comparison with CRASH and IMPACT models showed better performance by both derived models with lower Akaike information criterion and higher area under the curve values., CONCLUSIONS: Two accurate prognostic models, NNI Clinical and NNI+, were developed from our cohort of patients with severe TBI. Both models are specific to severe TBI and could be better alternatives to current available models. External validation is required to assess performance of models in a different setting.

Serum S100A12 as a prognostic biomarker of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Feng, Ma-Jing; Ning, Wei-Bin; Wang, Wei; Lv, Zhong-Hua; Liu, Xin-Bing; Zhu, Yong; Gao, Wei; Jin, Hong-Ze; Gao, Shu-Shan","BACKGROUND: S100A12 is related to acute brain injury and inflammation. We investigated the clinical prognostic value of serum S100A12 in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI)., METHODS: Serum S100A12, S100B, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were measured in 102 healthy controls and 102 sTBI patients. We recorded 30-day mortality and in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) including acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction. Trauma severity was assessed by admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores., RESULTS: When compared to the controls, serum S100A12, S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly increased in the patients. Serum concentrations of S100A12 significantly correlated with admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores and serum concentrations of S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Patients with any IMAEs or non-survivors within 30days had obviously higher serum concentrations of S100A12, S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha than other remaining ones. Serum S100A2 was independently associated with IMAEs and 30-day mortality and overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that S100A12 concentrations had significant discriminatory ability for patients at risk of any IMAEs and death within 30days., CONCLUSION: S100A12 might be associated with brain inflammation and evaluation of serum concentrations of S100A12 could be helpful in the early prognostic prediction in sTBI patients.

In this study, we describe the profile of plasma inflammatory cytokines and explore associations between these cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes after mTBI. Patients with mTBI with negative computed tomography and orthopedic injury (OI) controls without mTBI were prospectively recruited from emergency rooms at three trauma centers. Plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured from venous whole-blood samples that were collected at enrollment (within 24 h of injury) and at 6 months after injury. Neuropsychological tests were performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the injury. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify associations between inflammatory cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes. A total of 53 mTBI and 24 OI controls were included in this study. The majority of patients were male (62.3%), and injured in motor vehicle accidents (37.7%). Plasma interleukin (IL)-2 (p = 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.01) within 24 h post-injury were significantly higher for mTBI patients compared with OI controls. Elevated plasma IL-2 at 24 h was associated with more severe 1-week post-concussive symptoms (p = 0.001). At 6 months, elevated plasma IL-10 was associated with greater depression scores (p = 0.004) and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (p = 0.001). Plasma cytokine levels (within 24 h and at 6 months post-injury) were significantly associated with early and late post-concussive symptoms, PTSD, and depression scores after mTBI.

The application of a biomarker like procalcitonin (PCT) in TBI may allow for assessment of severity and thus aid in prognostication and correlation with mortality and outcome., AIMS: The primary objective is to determine the correlation between PCT concentrations with TBI outcomes (mainly in terms of mortality) at intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay., METHODS: In total, 186 TBI patients aged > 18 years with minimum survival for at least 12 h admitted to the ICU at the level 1 trauma center were prospectively included in the study and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. All admitted patients were treated according to the standard institutional protocol. The PCT levels were obtained on admission, on day 2, and 5. Clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were also collected. Primary mortality is defined as death related to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while secondary mortality defined as death related to sepsis or extracranial cause., RESULTS: Median PCT levels at admission, day 2, and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng/ml. In total, primary mortality was observed in 18 (9.7%) patients, while secondary causes were attributable in 20 (12.3%) patients. Regression analysis for primarily CNS cause of mortality showed PCT cutoff level at admission more than 5.5 ng/ml carried sensitivity and specificity of 75%, but for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, PCT cutoff values on day 2 > 1.15 ng/ml were derived significant with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. No significant association of parameters like length of ICU stay, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and primary/secondary mortality with the presence of extracranial injuries in TBI patients as compared with TBI alone was noted., CONCLUSION: This observational study demonstrates the poor correlation between PCT concentrations with outcome at days 1, 2, and 5 post-injury.

The subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) is an estimate of myocardial perfusion. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the SEVR in patients with severe TBI without previous cardiac diseases. Methods: Adult patients treated for severe TBI with a Glasgow coma score <8 were studied. Pressure waveforms were obtained by a high-fidelity tonometer in the radial artery for SEVR calculation at five time points: immediately after admission to the intensive care unit and 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after admission. SEVRs and other clinically important parameters were analyzed in patients who survived and did not survive after 28 days of treatment, as well as in patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC). Results: A total of 64 patients (16 females and 48 males) aged 18-64 years were included. Fifty patients survived and 14 died. DC was performed in 23 patients. SEVRs decreased 24 h after admission in nonsurvivors (p < 0.05) and after 48 h in survivors (p < 0.01) and its values were significantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors at 24, 72, and 96 h from admission (p < 0.05).

Determinants of Outcome in Traumatic Head Injuries: A South East Nigeria Experience.,"Ogolo, Donald Ekomobong; Ibe, Michael O","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to ascertain factors significantly responsible for mortality from traumatic head injuries and prescribe measures necessary to circumvent such outcome., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all traumatic head injuries seen at our facility from October 2013 to September 2015 was done utilizing data from patient's case notes, ward registers, and casualty department. Extracted data were analyzed using descriptive statistics., RESULTS: A total of 221 patient records were analyzed with 161 men and 60 women. It was observed that although the younger age group (19-30 years) was the most frequently affected by traumatic head injuries (36.2%), the elderly (>60 years) were 4.6 times more likely to die from traumatic head injuries than any other age group. Also, those with severe head injuries were 58 times more likely to die than any other category of head injury, even though the commonest category of head injuries seen were mild head injuries (68.7%). Patients with traumatic head injury from road traffic accidents were 5.8 times more likely to die than any other cause. The sex of the patient and the length of hospital stay had no significant influence on mortality from traumatic head injuries., CONCLUSIONS: The postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score, age of the patient, and mechanism of head injuries are important determining factors of outcome in traumatic head injuries, with the Glasgow Coma Scale score being the single most important determining factor. Efforts should be made at preventing such causes, with prompt and aggressive care instituted for cases at risk of unfavorable outcome. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The following data was collected: circumstances, clinical, biology, radiology, treatment and evolution., RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients with severe traumatic brain injury were collected (101 males, 84,9%). The mean age was 37,73+/-15,7 years. Road accidents were the most common cause representing 84%. The median Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 7+/-3. We noted 36 cases (30,3%) of anisocoria, 32 cases (26,9%) of bilateral mydriasis and 72 cases (60,5%) of hypoxia. Cerebral contusions (66,1%) and meningeal hemorrhage (66,6%) were the most frequent lesions on CT. Forty-seven patients (42%) had stage VI Marshall lesions. Twenty-four patients (20.1%) required a neurosurgical intervention, 12 extradural hematoma evacuations and 10 craniocerebral wounds. Mortality was 64.7% (77 deaths), the main cause was neurological (64,9%). In the latter group, we observed more frequently an older age (P=0.00001), a management delay (P=0.011), a low initial GCS (P=0.000001), a bilateral nonreactive mydriasis (P=0.0001), a hypoxia (P=0.0002), a subarachnoid hemorrhage (P=0.008), a high Marshall score (P=0.017) and an anemia (P=0.046)., CONCLUSION: Head trauma is a public health problem. The victims are young, and the sequelae are frequently disabling. Several parameters are associated with a poorer prognosis including age, neurological state and the initial delay in management.

Rotterdam and Marshall Scores for Prediction of in-hospital Mortality in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: An observational study.,"Asim, Mohammad; El-Menyar, Ayman; Parchani, Ashok; Nabir, Syed; Ahmed, Mohamed Nadeem; Ahmed, Zahoor; Ramzee, Ahmed Faidh; Al-Thani, Abdulaziz; Al-Abdulmalek, Abdulrahman; Al-Thani, Hassan","Background: We aimed to assess the prognostic value of Rotterdam and Marshall scoring systems to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for patients with TBI who underwent head computerized tomography (CT) scan at a Level I trauma center between 2011 and 2018. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the cutoff values for predicting in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1035 patients with TBI were included with a mean age of 30 years. The mean Rotterdam and Marshall scores were higher among non-survivors (p = .001). Patients with higher Rotterdam (>3) or Marshall (>2) CT scores were older, had higher injury severity scores and in-hospital mortality and had lower GCS and blood ethanol levels than those with lower scores. The cutoff point of Rotterdam score was 3.5 (sensitivity, 61.2%; specificity, 85.6%) and Marshall score was 2.5 (74.3% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio 8.4; 95% confidence interval 4.95-14.17 and odds ratio 4.4; 95% confidence interval 2.36-9.39, respectively).

"Prospective observational cohort study on epidemiology, treatment and outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in German BG hospitals.","Schwenkreis, Peter; Gonschorek, Andreas; Berg, Florian; Meier, Ullrich; Rogge, Witold; Schmehl, Ingo; Kern, Bodo Christian; Meisel, Hans-Jorg; Wohlfarth, Kai; Gross, Stefan; Sczesny-Kaiser, Matthias; Tegenthoff, Martin; Boschert, Jurgen; Bruckmoser, Ralf; Furst, Andrea; Schaan, Marc; Strowitzki, Martin; Pingel, Andreas; Jagers, Lisa Linnea; Rudolf, Henrik; Trampisch, Hans-Joachim; Lemcke, Johannes","OBJECTIVES: Since 2000/2001, no large-scale prospective studies addressing traumatic brain injury (TBI) epidemiology in Germany have been published. Our aim was to look for a possible shift in TBI epidemiology described in other European countries, to look for possible changes in TBI management and to identify predictors of 1-year outcome especially in patients with mild TBI., DESIGN: Observational cohort study., SETTING: All patients suffering from a TBI of any degree between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015, and who arrived in one of the seven participating BG hospitals within 24 hours after trauma, were included., PARTICIPANTS: In total, 3514 patients were included., OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial care, acute hospital care and rehabilitation were documented using standardised documentation forms. A standardised telephone interview was conducted 3 and 12 months after TBI in order to obtain information on outcome., RESULTS: Peaks were identified in males in the early 20s and mid-50s, and in both sexes in the late 70s, with 25% of all patients aged 75 or older. A fall was the most frequent cause of TBI, followed by traffic accidents (especially bicyclists). The number of head CT scans increased, and the number of conventional X-rays of the skull decreased compared with 2000/2001. Besides, more patients were offered rehabilitation than before. Though most TBI were classified as mild, one-third of the patients participating in the telephone interview after 12 months still reported troubles attributed to TBI. Negative predictors in mild TBI were female gender, intracranial bleeding and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13/14., CONCLUSION: The observed epidemiologic shift in TBI (ie, elderly patients, more falls, more bicyclists) calls for targeted preventive measures. The heterogeneity behind the diagnosis 'mild TBI' emphasises the need for defining subgroups not only based on GCS. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Selection of CT variables and prognostic models for outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Khaki, Djino; Hietanen, Virpi; Corell, Alba; Herges, Helena Odenstedt; Ljungqvist, Johan","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. Early outcome prediction in patients with TBI require reliable data input and stable prognostic models. The aim of this investigation was to analyze different CT classification systems and prognostic calculators in a representative population of TBI-patients, with known outcomes, in a neurointensive care unit (NICU), to identify the most suitable CT scoring system for continued research., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 158 consecutive patients with TBI admitted to the NICU at a level 1 trauma center in Sweden from 2012 to 2016. Baseline data on admission was recorded, CT scans were reviewed, and patient outcome one year after trauma was assessed according to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The Marshall classification, Rotterdam scoring system, Helsinki CT score and Stockholm CT score were tested, in addition to the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic calculators. The results were then compared with the actual outcomes., RESULTS: Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 3-8 in 38%, 9-13 in 27.2%, and 14-15 in 34.8% of the patients. GOS after one year showed good recovery in 15.8%, moderate disability in 27.2%, severe disability in 24.7%, vegetative state in 1.3% and death in 29.7%. When adding the variables from the IMPACT base model to the CT scoring systems, the Stockholm CT score yielded the strongest relationship to actual outcome. The results from the prognostic calculators IMPACT and CRASH were divided into two subgroups of mortality (percentages); <=50% (favorable outcome) and > 50% (unfavorable outcome). This yielded favorable IMPACT and CRASH scores in 54.4 and 38.0% respectively., CONCLUSION: The Stockholm CT score and the Helsinki score yielded the closest relationship between the models and the actual outcomes in this consecutive patient series, representative of a NICU TBI-population. Furthermore, the Stockholm CT score yielded the strongest overall relationship when adding variables from the IMPACT base model and would be our method of choice for continued research when using any of the current available CT score models.

"Fluid balance and outcome in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury (CENTER-TBI and OzENTER-TBI): a prospective, multicentre, comparative effectiveness study.","Wiegers, Eveline Janine Anna; Lingsma, Hester Floor; Huijben, Jilske Antonia; Cooper, David James; Citerio, Giuseppe; Frisvold, Shirin; Helbok, Raimund; Maas, Andrew Ian Ramsay; Menon, David Krishna; Moore, Elizabeth Madeleine; Stocchetti, Nino; Dippel, Diederik Willem; Steyerberg, Ewout Willem; van der Jagt, Mathieu; CENTER-TBI; OzENTER-TBI Collaboration Groups","BACKGROUND: Fluid therapy-the administration of fluids to maintain adequate organ tissue perfusion and oxygenation-is essential in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with traumatic brain injury. We aimed to quantify the variability in fluid management policies in patients with traumatic brain injury and to study the effect of this variability on patients' outcomes., METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, comparative effectiveness study of two observational cohorts: CENTER-TBI in Europe and OzENTER-TBI in Australia. Patients from 55 hospitals in 18 countries, aged 16 years or older with traumatic brain injury requiring a head CT, and admitted to the ICU were included in this analysis. We extracted data on demographics, injury, and clinical and treatment characteristics, and calculated the mean daily fluid balance (difference between fluid input and loss) and mean daily fluid input during ICU stay per patient. We analysed the association of fluid balance and input with ICU mortality and functional outcome at 6 months, measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Patient-level analyses relied on adjustment for key characteristics per patient, whereas centre-level analyses used the centre as the instrumental variable., FINDINGS: 2125 patients enrolled in CENTER-TBI and OzENTER-TBI between Dec 19, 2014, and Dec 17, 2017, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. The median age was 50 years (IQR 31 to 66) and 1566 (74%) of patients were male. The median of the mean daily fluid input ranged from 1.48 L (IQR 1.12 to 2.09) to 4.23 L (3.78 to 4.94) across centres. The median of the mean daily fluid balance ranged from -0.85 L (IQR -1.51 to -0.49) to 1.13 L (0.99 to 1.37) across centres. In patient-level analyses, a mean positive daily fluid balance was associated with higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.10 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.12] per 0.1 L increase) and worse functional outcome (1.04 [1.02 to 1.05] per 0.1 L increase); higher mean daily fluid input was also associated with higher ICU mortality (1.05 [1.03 to 1.06] per 0.1 L increase) and worse functional outcome (1.04 [1.03 to 1.04] per 1-point decrease of the GOSE per 0.1 L increase). Centre-level analyses showed similar associations of higher fluid balance with ICU mortality (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.29]) and worse functional outcome (1.07 [1.02 to 1.13]), but higher fluid input was not associated with ICU mortality (OR 0.95 [0.90 to 1.00]) or worse functional outcome (1.01 [0.98 to 1.03])., INTERPRETATION: In critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, there is significant variability in fluid management, with more positive fluid balances being associated with worse outcomes. These results, when added to previous evidence, suggest that aiming for neutral fluid balances, indicating a state of normovolaemia, contributes to improved outcome., FUNDING: European Commission 7th Framework program and the Australian Health and Medical Research Council.

"Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department: Epidemiology, Outcomes and Risk Factors Predicting the Prognosis.","Heydari, Farhad; Golban, Mohammad; Majidinejad, Saeed","Introduction: The continuing-to-grow number of older adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting to emergency departments (EDs) and hospitals necessitates the investigation of TBI in these patients., Objective: The present study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology of TBI and the factors affecting intracranial lesions and patient outcomes in older adults., Method: The present retrospective cross-sectional study was performed between March 2016 and March 2018. The study population comprised all TBI patients with a minimum age of 60 years presenting to the ED. The eligible candidates consisted of patients presenting to the ED within 24 hours of the occurrence of traumas and requiring head CT scan as part of their examination. The patients' baseline information was also recorded., Results: A total of 306 older adult patients with a mean age of 70.61+/-8.63 years, of whom 67.6% were male, underwent CT scan for TBI during the study period. Falls were the major cause of head injuries, and intracranial lesions were observed in 22.9% (n=70) of the patients. Subdural hematoma (SDH) was observed as the most prevalent injury in 27.6% of the patients, 22.9% (n=16) were transferred to the operating room, and 7.5% (n=23) died. Moreover, the severity of trauma was significantly different between the two genders (P=0.029). Midline shift, SDH, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and moderate-to-severe head injuries were also significantly associated with poor outcomes (P<0.05)., Conclusion: Death from TBIs was more likely in the patients with SDH, SAH and midline shift or in those with an initial Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of below 13. These predictions are clinically relevant, and can help improve the management of older adults with TBI.

"Apathy Level, Disinhibition, and Psychiatric Conditions Are Related to the Employment Status of People With Traumatic Brain Injury.","Funayama, Michitaka; Nakagawa, Yoshitaka; Nakajima, Asuka; Kawashima, Hiroaki; Matsukawa, Isamu; Takata, Taketo; Kurose, Shin","IMPORTANCE: An understanding of the potential prognostic factors as they relate to the employment status of people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is necessary so that occupational therapy practitioners can provide the most effective treatment., OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of apathy, disinhibition, and psychiatric conditions on employment status after TBI., DESIGN: An observational study conducted from March 2015 to March 2020., SETTING: Cognitive dysfunction clinics associated with two general hospitals in Japan., PARTICIPANTS: Japanese people of working age (N = 110, ages 18-65 yr) with TBI. Outcomes and Measures: As an outcome indicator, each participant's employment status was rated on a 3-point scale (i.e., 3 = regular employment, 2 = welfare employment [employed as a person with disabilities or undergoing vocational training in the Japanese welfare employment system, for which a worker is paid under either system], 1 = unemployment). Psychiatric, neuropsychological, and physical assessments were measured as explanatory variables. The impact of various factors on employment status was investigated using linear discriminant regression analysis., RESULTS: The level of apathy, disinhibition, and incidence of psychiatric conditions after TBI, as well as age and years postinjury, were related to employment status. Conclusion and Relevance: Although this is a cross-sectional study, interventions for apathy and disinhibition, as well as management of psychiatric conditions, are recommended to help improve employment status among people with TBI. What This Article Adds: The employment status of people with TBI is related more to apathy, disinhibition, and psychiatric conditions than to intelligence, memory function, or executive function.

This pilot study focused on TBI patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and aimed at identifying patterns of circulating biomarkers associated with the disability level at 6 months from injury, measured by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E). The concentration of 107 biomarkers, including proteins related to inflammation, innate immunity, TBI, and central nervous system, were quantified in blood samples collected on ICU admission from 80 patients. Patients were randomly selected among those prospectively enrolled in the Collaborative Research on Acute Traumatic Brain Injury in Intensive Care Medicine in Europe (CREACTIVE) observational study. Six biomarkers were selected to be associated with indicators of primary or secondary brain injury: three glial proteins (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S100 calcium-binding protein B) and three cytokines (stem cell factor, fibroblast growth factor [FGF] 23 and FGF19). The subjects were grouped into three clusters according to the expression of these proteins. The distribution of the 6-month GOS-E was significantly different across clusters (p < 0.001). In two clusters, the number of 6-month deaths or vegetative states was significantly lower than expected, as calculated according to a customization of the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) scores (observed/expected [O/E] events = 0.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00-0.90 and 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.94). In one cluster, less-than-expected unfavorable outcomes (O/E = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.05-0.95) and more-than-expected good recoveries (O/E = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.06) were observed. The improved prognostic accuracy of the pattern of these six circulating biomarkers at ICU admission upon established clinical parameters and computed tomography results needs validation in larger, independent cohorts.

Development and validation of a prehospital-stage prediction tool for traumatic brain injury: a multicentre retrospective cohort study in Korea.,"Choi, Yeongho; Park, Jeong Ho; Hong, Ki Jeong; Ro, Young Sun; Song, Kyoung Jun; Shin, Sang Do","OBJECTIVES: Predicting diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the prehospital stage is challenging; however, using comprehensive prehospital information and machine learning may improve the performance of the predictive model. We developed and tested predictive models for TBI that use machine learning algorithms using information that can be obtained in the prehospital stage., DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted at three tertiary academic emergency departments (EDs) located in an urban area of South Korea. The data from adult patients with severe trauma who were assessed by emergency medical service providers and transported to three participating hospitals between 2014 to 2018 were analysed., RESULTS: We developed and tested five machine learning algorithms-logistic regression analyses, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, random forest and elastic net (EN)-to predict TBI, TBI with intracranial haemorrhage or injury (TBI-I), TBI with ED or admission result of admission or transferred (TBI with non-discharge (TBI-ND)) and TBI with ED or admission result of death (TBI-D). A total of 1169 patients were included in the final analysis, and the proportions of TBI, TBI-I, TBI-ND and TBI-D were 24.0%, 21.5%, 21.3% and 3.7%, respectively. The EN model yielded an area under receiver-operator curve of 0.799 for TBI, 0.844 for TBI-I, 0.811 for TBI-ND and 0.871 for TBI-D. The EN model also yielded the highest specificity and significant reclassification improvement. Variables related to loss of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale and light reflex were the three most important variables to predict all outcomes., CONCLUSION: Our results inform the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI. Machine learning models resulted in significant performance improvement over that with logistic regression analyses, and the best performing model was EN.

Longitudinal Course of Traumatic Brain Injury Biomarkers for the Prediction of Clinical Outcomes: A Review.,"Peters, Austin J; Schnell, Eric; Saugstad, Julie A; Treggiari, Miriam M","Protein biomarkers are often measured at hospital presentation to diagnose traumatic brain injury (TBI) and predict patient outcomes. However, a biomarker measurement at this single time point is no more accurate at predicting patient outcomes than less invasive and more cost-effective methods. Here, we review evidence that TBI biomarkers provide greater prognostic value when measured repeatedly over time, such that a trajectory of biomarker concentrations can be evaluated. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central Register were searched to identify studies from the last decade in which established TBI biomarkers had been measured at more than one time point following acute TBI, and which related their findings to patient outcomes. Twenty-two studies were identified, 18 of which focused on adults and 4 of which focused on children. Three general biomarker trajectories were identified: persistently high, persistently low, and reversal of decreasing concentrations. Downtrend reversal was highly specific to predicting poor patient outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that biomarker trajectories can be affected by therapeutic interventions. Additional studies demonstrated that biomarkers measured at a later time point offered superior prognostic value than a single measurement obtained at initial hospital presentation. Among other details, longitudinal biomarker trajectory assessments may identify ongoing injury and predict patient deterioration before clinical symptoms develop and thus help guide therapeutic interventions.",2021,/,Journal of neurotrauma,38,18,2490-2501,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7448,33899510,#4063,Peters 2021,,yes

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a widely used biomarker of inflammation with potential as a prognostic biomarker after TBI. The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study prospectively enrolled TBI patients within 24 h of injury, as well as orthopedic injury and uninjured controls; biospecimens were collected at enrollment. A subset of hospitalized participants had blood collected on day 3, day 5, and 2 weeks. High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured.

Transcranial Doppler Based Cerebrovascular Reactivity Indices in Adult Traumatic Brain Injury: A Scoping Review of Associations With Patient Oriented Outcomes.,"Gomez, Alwyn; Froese, Logan; Sainbhi, Amanjyot Singh; Batson, Carleen; Zeiler, Frederick A","Background: Disruption in cerebrovascular reactivity following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known phenomenon that may hold prognostic value and clinical relevance. Ultimately, improved knowledge of this process and more robust means of continuous assessment may lead to advances in precision medicine following TBI. One such method is transcranial Doppler (TCD), which has been employed to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity following injury utilizing a continuous time-series approach. Objective: The present study undertakes a scoping review of the literature on the association of continuous time-domain TCD based indices of cerebrovascular reactivity, with global functional outcomes, cerebral physiologic correlates, and imaging evidence of lesion change. Design: Multiple databases were searched from inception to November 2020 for articles relevant to the association of continuous time-domain TCD based indices of cerebrovascular reactivity with global functional outcomes, cerebral physiologic correlates, and imaging evidence of lesion change. Results: Thirty-six relevant articles were identified. There was significant evidence supporting an association with continuous time-domain TCD based indices and functional outcomes following TBI. Indices based on mean flow velocity, as measured by TCD, were most numerous while more recent studies point to systolic flow velocity-based indices encoding more prognostic utility. Physiologic parameters such as intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reactivity as well as more established indices of cerebrovascular reactivity have all been associated with these TCD based indices. The literature has been concentrated in a few centres and is further limited by the lack of multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This systematic scoping review of the literature identifies that there is a substantial body of evidence that cerebrovascular reactivity as measured by time-domain TCD based indices have prognostic utility following TBI. Indices based on mean flow velocities have the largest body of literature for their support. However, recent studies indicate that indices based on systolic flow velocities may contain the most prognostic utility and more closely follow more established measures of cerebrovascular reactivity. To a lesser extent, the literature supports some associations between these indices and cerebral physiologic parameters.

[Mild head injury].,"Ortega Zufiria, Jose Manuel; Prieto, Noemi Lomillos; Cuba, Bernardino Choque; Degenhardt, Martin Tamarit; Nunez, Pedro Poveda; Lopez Serrano, Maria Remedios; Lopez Raigada, Azahara Belen","INTRODUCTION: Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health concern, because a sizeable number of patients with mild TBI will develop potentially life-threatening complications. The target of this study was to describe a large series of adult patients suffering from mild TBI, treated at University Hospital of Getafe, between 2010 and 2015 (n = 2480). We examined the patients' epidemiological and baseline clinical profile, diagnosis, treatment and ultimate outcomes, to identify major prognostic factors that influence the final result., METHODS: We retrospectively extracted patient data from medical records and performed both bivariate and multivariate statistics., RESULTS: In our sample, mild TBI was more common in men, and the most common causative mechanism was a traffic accident. We proposed a model for classifying patients according to risk, dividing them into low, intermediate and high risk, based upon their baseline clinical picture. This classification scheme correlated well with final outcomes. We investigated indications for skull radiography and computed tomography (CT), as well as for hospital admission for clinical observation., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of a neurological focus on clinical examination, the existence of a fracture on plain radiographs, advanced age and the presence of a coagulation disorder were associated with the increased likelihood of intracranial complications and a poor prognosis. The Glasgow Coma Scale was deficient predicting patient outcomes, because it failed to account for concussion-related symptoms like amnesia and loss of consciousness, both very common in patients with mild TBI.",2018,/,Surgical neurology international,9,Suppl 1,S16-S28,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/sni.sni_371_17,29430327,#4038,OrtegaZufiria 2018,,yes
"Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults: Characteristics, Outcomes, and Considerations.

Exclusion criteria were any other body region abbreviated injury scale score >2 and presentation at enrolling center >24 hours after injury., METHODS: The analysis was restricted to individuals aged >=65 and stratified into 3 age groups: young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and oldest-old (>=85). Demographic, clinical, and injury data were collected. Predictors of mortality, palliative interventions, and discharge to preinjury residence in the moderate/severe TBI group were identified using Classification and Regression Tree and Generalized Linear Mixed Models., RESULTS: Of the 3081 subjects enrolled in the study, 2028 were >=65 years old. Overall, 339 (16.7%) presented with a moderate/severe TBI and experienced a 64% mortality rate. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <9 was the main predictor of mortality, CT worsening (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, P < .04), cerebral edema (OR = 2.4, P < .04), GCS <9, and age >=75 (OR = 2.1, P = .007) were predictors for palliative interventions, and an injury severity score <=24 (OR = 0.087, P = .002) was associated with increased likelihood of discharge to preinjury residence in the moderate/severe TBI group., CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In this prospective study of a large cohort of older adults with isolated TBI, comparisons across the older age groups with moderate/severe TBI revealed that survival and favorable discharge disposition were influenced more by severity of injury rather than age itself. Indicating that chronological age alone maybe insufficient to accurately predict outcomes, and increased representation of older adults in TBI research to develop better diagnostic and prognostic tools is warranted.

Modeling the return to consciousness after severe traumatic brain injury at a large academic level 1 trauma center.,"Winans, Nathan J; Liang, Justine J; Ashcroft, Bradley; Doyle, Stephen; Fry, Adam; Fiore, Susan M; Mofakham, Sima; Mikell, Charles B","OBJECTIVE: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) carries significant morbidity and mortality. It remains difficult to counsel families on functional prognosis and plan research initiatives aimed at treating traumatic coma. In order to better address these problems, the authors set out to develop statistical models using retrospective data to identify admission characteristics that correlate with time until the return of consciousness, defined as the time to follow commands (TFC). These results were then used to create a TFC score, allowing for rapid identification of patients with predicted prolonged TFC., METHODS: Data were reviewed and collected from medical records of sTBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor subscores <= 5 who were admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital from January 2011 to July 2018. Data were used to calculate descriptive statistics and build binary logistic regression models to identify admission characteristics that correlated with in-hospital mortality and in-hospital command-following. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify admission characteristics that correlated with the length of TFC. A TFC score was developed using the significant variables identified in the Cox regression model., RESULTS: There were 402 adult patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study. The average age was 50.5 years, and 122 (30.3%) patients were women. In-hospital mortality was associated with older age, higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher Rotterdam score (head CT grading system), and the presence of bilateral fixed and dilated pupils (p < 0.01). In-hospital command-following was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil (p < 0.05). TFC was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Additionally, patients who sustained injuries from falls from standing height had a shorter average TFC. The 3 significant variables from the Cox regression model that explained the most variance were used to create a 4-point TFC score. The most significant of these characteristics were Rotterdam head CT scores, high impact traumas, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Importantly, the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil was correlated with longer TFC but no increase in likelihood of in-hospital mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The creation of the 4-point TFC score will allow clinicians to quickly identify patients with predicted prolonged TFC and estimate the likelihood of command-following at different times after injury.

Validation of the Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score: Observational Case Control Study.,"Bobeff, Ernest Jan; Stawiski, Konrad; Stanislawska, Patrycja Alicja; Posmyk, Bartlomiej Jozef; Wisniewski, Karol; Bryl, Maciej; Piotrowski, Michal Mateusz; Fortuniak, Jan; Jaskolski, Dariusz Jan","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a particular health risk for the elderly. The recently developed elderly TBI (eTBI) score combines the prognostic information of the risk factors characteristic of the geriatric population. We aimed to determine its validity and reliability on an independent sample., METHODS: We present a retrospective analysis of 506 consecutive patients after TBI aged >=65 years. The previously described nomogram and the eTBI score were used. The primary outcome measure was mortality or vegetative state at 30 days after hospital admission., RESULTS: Mortality or vegetative state rate was 21.3%. The nomogram and eTBI Score showed similar predictive performance with accuracy of 83.8% (95% confidence interval 80.2%-87%) and 84.4% (95% confidence interval 80.8%-87.6%), respectively. On the basis of the Youden index and C4.5 algorithm, we divided patients according to the 3-tier pattern into low-, high-, and medium-risk groups. The outcome prediction in the first 2 groups was correct in 93.1% (survival in the low-risk group) and 94.4% (mortality in the high-risk group). Patients included in the medium-risk group usually required surgical treatment (85.3%) and were characterized by increased mortality or vegetative state (55%). Among patients with eTBI >=5 (n = 221), there was no difference in outcome between those treated conservatively and surgically., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study confirming the validity of the eTBI Score and its close association with outcome of geriatric population after TBI. The novel 3-tier risk stratification scheme was applicable to both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Predictors of mortality among head trauma patients reaching ICU,Beniameen M.; Abbas N.; Mashhour K.; ElGohary T. ,"Study Objectives: Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ninety percent occurs in low and middle income countries. We construct a predictive model for mortality in head injury patients on the basis of easily available parameters. Method(s): Prospective randomized study that included 100 head trauma patients admitted to the ICU in a period of 15 months. Demographic data, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac history were recorded. Admission blood samples were obtained for CBC, coagulation profile, kidney and liver functions tests and lactate level and random blood glucose level. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis including the area under the ROC and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent mortality predictors of admission parameters to create a prognostic model. Result(s): A total of 58 patients died (58%) out of 100 patients included in this study. Multivariate analysis revealed that age> 75 years (HR=25.49, 95% CI=2.36 to 275.66); GCS <9 (HR=4.19, 95% CI=1.58to 11.08); serum creatinine higher than 1.5 mg/ml (HR=8.75; 95% CI=3.10 to 24.71); PaCO2 >45mmHg (HR =14.86; 95% CI=4.85 to 45.49) and history of cardiac diseases (HR=0.37 95% CI=0.15 to 0.91) were associated with high mortality rate.

Method(s): From December 2016 until January 2020, 156 patients, 96 males and 60 females with TBI requiring mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours GCS <= 8 were studied. The mean age was 43 years. On admission to the ICU they had body mass index 27 +/- 6 kg/m2 and APACHE II score 20 +/- 2. Out of 156 patients the 54 had co morbid medical illness.

Relationship between gender and recovery rate from postconcussion syndrome in older adults receiving physical therapy rehabilitation,Deoghare H.; Mouri C.; List K. ,"BACKGROUND Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a growing epidemic in the geriatric population across the world. A minority of patients with mTBI develop persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS) defined by a cluster of cognitive, somatic and emotional symptomslasting for >3 months. Multiple systematic reviews highlight the prognostic significance of age, biological sex and other factors such as preadmission functional ability and comorbidities on development of PCS. However, these variables remain understudied in older adults. Moreover, research is needed to determine how utilization of physical therapy (PT) services may affect recovery. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between gender and recovery rate from PCS in Older Adults receiving PT rehabilitation. METHOD A retrospective chart review of 45 patients (27 females and 18 males) in the age 65 and older referred for to PT rehabilitation at Saint Joseph Hospital, Orange, CA was performed. More data are being compiled from older paper-based medical records and combined analysis will be presented at the conference. All the patients had a history of a traumatic event such as falls or MVA which may have resulted in concussion. At initial evaluation and discharge, recordings were made of outcome measures of self-report [Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)] and gait and balance performance [Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), gait speed, and the Sensory Organization Test (SOT)]. RESULTS Based on interim analysis both males and females in the 65 and older age group improved with dizziness, balance or both in an average of 9.5 visits. Females had a clinically significant improvement in DHI outcome (27+/-3) whereas for males the average improvement in DHI was not clinically significant (10+/-4) (MCID for DHI =18 units). Additionally, both genders showed clinically significant improvement on SOT (MCID for SOT =8 points) and DGI scores (MCID of DGI = 3). CONCLUSIONS. Both females and males improved in the same number of visits. However, females showed clinically significant improvement over males on self reported dizziness as measured by DHI but not on DGI or SOT.",2021,/,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,69,SUPPL 1,S149,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,634826654,#19812,Deoghare 2021,,maybe
Risk factors for cerebral infarction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury,Wu Y.-G.; Chao Y.; Gao G.; Bao D.; Dong Y.; Wei X.; Niu C. ,"Purpose: Posttraumatic cerebral infarction (PTCI) is a common and relatively serious complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) without a clear etiology. Evaluating risk factors in advance is particularly important to predict and avoid the occurrence of PTCI. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 297 patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in our hospital from January 2019 to September 2020 and evaluated the effects of various factors such as age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), skull base fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), brain herniation, hypotensive shock, and decompressive craniectomy on the incidence of PTCI. We also performed a multivariate logistics regression analysis on the relevant factors identified and evaluated the diagnostic value of each risk factor in advance by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Result(s): Among the patients, 32 (10.77%) suffered PTCI. The incidence rates of PTCI in those with GCS scores of 3-8 and 9-12 were 15.87% (30/189) and 1.85% (2/108), respectively, while the rates were 18.84% (13/69), 15.03% (29/193), 18.57% (13/70), and 20.59% (14/68) in those with skull base fractures, traumatic SAH, brain herniation, and hypotensive shock, respectively, and 14.38% (23/160) in those who underwent decompressive craniectomy. These differences in PTCI incidence were statistically significant. However, the differences in PTCI incidence caused by patient age and sex were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Low GCS score, skull base fractures, traumatic SAH, brain herniation, hypotensive shock, and decompressive craniectomy are risk factors for the occurrence of PTCI, while age and sex are not significantly correlated with the occurrence of PTCI.Copyright Â© 2021 Wu et al.",2021,/,Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management,17,"(Wu, Chao, Gao, Bao, Dong, Wei, Niu) Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, China(Wu, Niu) Brain Function and Brain Dis",433-440,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S309662,2007462161,#19708,Wu 2021,,maybe
Cognitive Reserve in Individuals Aging with Traumatic Brain Injury: Independent and Interactive Effects on Cognitive Functioning,Venkatesan U.M.; Rabinowitz A.R.; Bernier R.A.; Hillary F.G. ,"Objective: To examine the influence of 2 temporal factors-age and injury chronicity-on the relationship between cognitive reserve (CR) and cognitive functioning in older adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting(s): Outpatient research laboratory. Participant(s): Adults, 50 years or older, with a 1-to 45-year history of moderate or severe TBI (N = 108). Design(s): Cross-sectional observational study. Main Measures: CR was estimated using demographically corrected performance on a word-reading test (an approximation of premorbid IQ). Injury chronicity was operationalized as number of years since the date of injury. Composite cognitive scores were computed from performances on neuropsychological tests of processing speed, executive functioning, and memory. Result(s): CR was positively and significantly related to all cognitive performances independent of age, injury chronicity, and injury severity. Greater injury chronicity significantly attenuated the effect of CR on processing speed such that individuals more distal from their injury date evidenced a weaker positive relationship between CR and performance. Conclusion(s): Temporal factors may modify associations between CR and cognition. Findings suggest that the protective effects of CR are temporally delimited, potentially contending with declines in brain reserve. The prognostic value of traditional outcome determinants should be considered in the context of injury chronicity.Copyright Â© 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Influence of alcohol on early Glasgow Coma Scale in head-injured patients.,"Shahin, Hazem; Gopinath, Shankar P; Robertson, Claudia S","BACKGROUND: To assess the depressant effects of alcohol on the level of consciousness of patients admitted with head injuries, this study examined the changes that occur in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of traumatic brain injury patients over time., METHODS: The records of 269 head trauma patients consecutively admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit were examined retrospectively. Eighty-one patients were excluded because of incomplete data. The remaining 188 patients were further divided into an intoxicated group (blood alcohol concentration [BAC] >= 0.08%, n = 100 [53%]) and a nonintoxicated group (BAC <0.08%, n = 88 [47%]). The GCS in the prehospital setting, in the emergency department, and the highest GCS achieved during the first 24 hours postinjury were compared., RESULTS: The change between emergency department-GCS and the best day 1 GCS in the intoxicated group was greater than the nonintoxicated group and deemed clinically and statistically significant; median change (3 vs. 0) p < 0.001. To assess whether these results were directly related to the BAC%, piecewise regression using a general linear model was used to assess the intercept and slope of alcohol on the changes of GCS with cutting point at BAC% = 0.08. The analysis showed that, in the nonintoxicated range, the effect of alcohol was not significantly related to the changes of GCS. But in the intoxicated range, BAC% was significantly positively related to the changes of GCS., CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the GCS increases significantly over time in alcohol intoxicated patients with traumatic brain injury.",2010,/,The Journal of trauma,69,5,1176-1181,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e3181edbd47,21068620,#9484,Shahin 2010,,yes
GFAP and S100B are biomarkers of traumatic brain injury: an observational cohort study.,"Vos, P E; Jacobs, B; Andriessen, T M J C; Lamers, K J B; Borm, G F; Beems, T; Edwards, M; Rosmalen, C F; Vissers, J L M","BACKGROUND: Biomarker levels in blood after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may offer diagnostic and prognostic tools in addition to clinical indices. This study aims to validate glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B concentrations in blood as outcome predictors of TBI using cutoff levels of 1.5 mug/L for GFAP and 1.13 mug/L for S100B from a previous study., METHODS: In 79 patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] <=12), serum, taken at hospital admission, was analyzed for GFAP and S100B. Data collected included injury mechanism, age, gender, mass lesion on CT, GCS, pupillary reactions, Injury Severity Score (ISS), presence of hypoxia, and hypotension. Outcome was assessed, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (dichotomized in death vs alive and unfavorable vs favorable), 6 months post injury., RESULTS: In patients who died compared to alive patients, median serum levels were increased: GFAP 33.4-fold and S100B 2.1-fold. In unfavorable compared to favorable outcome, GFAP was increased 19.8-fold and S100B 2.1-fold. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that mass lesion, GFAP, absent pupils, age, and ISS, but not GCS, hypotension, or hypoxia, predicted death and unfavorable outcome. Multivariable analysis showed that models containing mass lesion, pupils, GFAP, and S100B were the strongest in predicting death and unfavorable outcome.

Hypothermia and rapid rewarming is associated with worse outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Thompson, Hilaire J; Kirkness, Catherine J; Mitchell, Pamela H","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine (1) the prevalence and degree of hypothermia in patients on emergency department admission and (2) the effect of hypothermia and rate of rewarming on patient outcomes., METHODS: Secondary data analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a level I trauma center following severe traumatic brain injury (n = 147). Patients were grouped according to temperature on admission according to hypothermia status and rate of rewarming (rapid or slow). Regression analyses were performed., FINDINGS: Hypothermic patients were more likely to have lower postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale scores and a higher initial injury severity score. Hypothermia on admission was correlated with longer intensive care unit stays, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale score at discharge, higher mortality rate, and lower Glasgow outcome score-extended scores up to 6 months postinjury (P < .05). When controlling for other factors, rewarming rates more than 0.25degreeC/h were associated with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores at discharge, longer intensive care unit length of stay, and higher mortality rate than patients rewarmed more slowly although these did not reach statistical significance., CONCLUSION: Hypothermia on admission is correlated with worse outcomes in brain-injured patients.

External validation of a prognostic model for early mortality after traumatic brain injury.,"Ronning, Pal A; Pedersen, Tor; Skaga, Nils O; Helseth, Eirik; Langmoen, Iver A; Stavem, Knut","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of lost disability-adjusted life years, and a valid model allowing prediction of outcome would be welcome. For a clinical prediction model to be valid, generalization to other populations must be possible. The aim of this study was to externally validate a model for in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI, which was recently development at the University of Southern California (USC)., METHODS: The validation cohort was derived from a hospital-based, prospectively collected trauma registry in Oslo, Norway. We included patients admitted with a head injury without hypotension, severe thoracic, or abdominal injury (n = 3,136). We calculated the probability of death according to the USC model. The performance of the model was evaluated using measures of calibration and discrimination in the total sample and subgroups according to initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score., RESULTS: The USC model provided excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.93), but unsatisfactory calibration (p < 0.001) for the total sample (GCS 3-15). In the GCS 4-8 subgroup we found good discrimination (AUC = 0.89) but poor calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The findings question the external validity of the USC model, suggesting that it should not be implemented as a tool for short-term mortality prediction in our TBI population.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,70,4,E56-61,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e3181e80f0a,20805767,#9420,Ronning 2011,,yes
Mild hypothermia therapy reduces blood glucose and lactate and improves neurologic outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Zhao, Qing-Jv; Zhang, Xue-Guang; Wang, Le-Xin","PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the association between blood glucose or lactate and the outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to evaluate the effect of mild hypothermia therapy on glucose and lactate levels., METHODS: Eighty-one patients with TBI were randomly divided into normothermia (n = 41) and mild hypothermia (n = 40) group. Body temperature of hypothermia group was maintained at 32.7degreeC for 72 hours. Arterial blood glucose and lactic acid were determined before and after hypothermia therapy. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score was assessed 3 months after the treatment., RESULTS: The mean glucose (7.04 +/- 0.51 vs 9.71 +/- 1.63 mmol/L, P < .05) in the hypothermia group was lower than in the normothermia group after hypothermia therapy. There were more patients with good neurologic function (GOS 4-5) in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (75.0% vs 51.2%, P = .038). Multivariate regression analysis showed that blood glucose greater than 10 mmol/L (adjusted risk ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-13.2; P < .05) was an independent predictor for poor neurologic outcomes in these patients, and hypothermia therapy was an independent predictor for favorable outcomes (risk ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-15.6; P < .05). No significant association between lactate and GOS scores was identified in the multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia after TBI was associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the predictive value of blood lactate level requires further investigation. Hypothermia therapy improves neurologic outcomes in patients with severe TBI, and reduction in blood glucose may be partially responsible for the improved outcomes. Crown Copyright Â© 2011.

Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a humoral component of the innate immune system which has been studied as a marker of inflammatory, infections or cardiovascular pathologies. To investigate the association between serum levels of PTX3 and the hospital mortality of patients with severe TBI., METHODS: The independent association between serum PTX3 levels after severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS <= 8) and hospital mortality was analyzed in a prospective study of 83 consecutive patients by a multiple logistic regression analysis. The leukocyte count in the same sample was analyzed as another marker of inflammatory response., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 35 years and 85% were male. Serum PTX3 levels were determined 18.0 (SD +/- 17.0) h after TBI. Patients who died showed a mean serum PTX3 level of 9.95 mug/ml (SD +/- 6.42) in comparison to 5.46 mug/ml (SD +/- 4.87) of the survivor group (P = 0.007). Elevated serum PTX3 levels remain significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.04) in the subset of patients with isolated TBI (n = 34). There were no differences in the leukocytes count measured in the same blood sample used for PTX3 determination in survivors and non-survivors (P = 0.56). The final multiple logistic regression model including age, pupillary examination, GCS, associated trauma, and PTX3 levels shows that serum levels of PTX3 which were higher than 10 mug/ml were independently associated with the patients mortality (adjusted OR 3.06, CI 95% 1.03-9.15, P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum PTX3 levels after severe TBI are independently associated with higher hospital mortality and may be a useful marker of TBI and its prognosis.",2011,/,Neurocritical care,14,2,194-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-010-9462-y,20972645,#9401,Gullo 2011,,yes

Acute and delayed mild coagulopathy are related to outcome in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury.,"Greuters, Sjoerd; van den Berg, Annelies; Franschman, Gaby; Viersen, Victor A; Beishuizen, Albertus; Peerdeman, Saskia M; Boer, Christa; ALARM-BLEEDING investigators","INTRODUCTION: The relationship between isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) associated coagulopathy and patient prognosis frequently lacks information regarding the time course of coagulation disorders throughout the post-traumatic period. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and time course of post-traumatic coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI and the relationship of these hemostatic disorders with outcome., METHODS: The local Human Subjects Committee approved the study. We retrospectively studied the medical records of computed tomography (CT)-confirmed isolated TBI patients with an extracranial abbreviated injury scale (AIS) <3 who were primarily referred to a Level 1 trauma centre in Amsterdam (n = 107). Hemostatic parameters including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, glucose, pH and lactate levels were recorded throughout a 72-hour period as part of a routine standardized follow-up of TBI. Coagulopathy was defined as a aPPT >40 seconds and/or a PTT in International Normalized Ratio (INR) >1.2 and/or a platelet count <120*109/l., RESULTS: Patients were mostly male, aged 48 +/- 20 years with a median injury severity score of 25 (range 20 to 25). Early coagulopathy as diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) occurred in 24% of all patients. The occurrence of TBI-related coagulopathy increased to 54% in the first 24 hours post-trauma. In addition to an increased age and disturbed pupillary reflex, both coagulopathy upon ED arrival and during the first 24 hours post-trauma provided an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable outcome (odds ratio (OR) 3.75 (95% CI 1.07 to 12.51; P = 0.04) and OR 11.61 (2.79 to 48.34); P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a high prevalence of early and delayed coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI, which is strongly associated with an unfavorable outcome. These data support close monitoring of hemostasis after TBI and indicate that correction of coagulation disturbances might need to be considered.",2011,/,"Critical care (London, England)",15,1,R2,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc9399,21208418,#9376,Greuters 2011,,yes
Predictive ability of preinjury stressful life events and post-traumatic stress symptoms for outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury: analysis in a prospective emergency room sample.,"van Veldhoven, L M; Sander, A M; Struchen, M A; Sherer, M; Clark, A N; Hudnall, Gina Evans; Hannay, H J","BACKGROUND: A subset of persons with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) experience long-term difficulties. Preinjury stress has been hypothesised to play a role in long-term maintenance of symptoms., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive ability of preinjury stressful life events and post-traumatic stress symptoms to health-related quality of life and emotional distress after mTBI., METHODS: Within 2 weeks of injury, 186 participants with mTBI who were admitted to an emergency centre completed an interview and questionnaires regarding preinjury functioning, including the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months after injury and included the depression and anxiety subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the physical and mental component scores of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The incidence and type of stressful life events were reported. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine the predictive utility of Stressful Life Events Questionnaire and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist after controlling for age, injury severity (complicated versus uncomplicated mild) and preinjury depression., RESULTS: Several potentially life-altering stressful events were endorsed by at least 25% of participants as having been experienced prior to injury. The incidence of stressful life events was a significant predictor of all four outcome variables. History of post-traumatic stress symptoms was predictive of scores on the SF-36 mental health component., CONCLUSIONS: A history of stressful events may predispose persons with mTBI to have poor outcomes.

Correlation between coagulopathy and outcome in severe head trauma in neurointensive care and trauma units.,"Salehpour, Firooz; Bazzazi, Amir Mohammad; Porhomayon, Jahan; Nader, Nader D","BACKGROUND: Abnormal blood coagulation after traumatic brain injury is a common finding. Some studies have proposed these changes as useful predictors of outcome in patients with head trauma. This study aimed at evaluating the association of the routine tests of blood coagulation within the first hours after severe head trauma with prognosis of patients with severe head trauma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients with severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], <=8) were admitted at Tabriz University Hospital for 1 year. Patients with major accompanying trauma were excluded. On admission, serum levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as the platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were documented. The relation between these parameters with final outcome and also with GCS at admission, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week after admission and discharge time and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were studied., RESULTS: Thirty three patients were discharged, and 19 died. There were significant negative correlations between PT, PTT, and INR with all GCS and GOS scores. These correlations were significant and positive between the platelet count and all GCS and GOS scores. Median PT, PTT, and INR were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Median serum platelets count was significantly lower in nonsurvivors., CONCLUSION: On-admission PT, PTT, INR and platelet count may be used as predictors of outcome and prognosis of patients with severe head trauma.

In vivo monitoring of neuronal loss in traumatic brain injury: a microdialysis study.,"Petzold, Axel; Tisdall, Martin M; Girbes, Armand R; Martinian, Lillian; Thom, Maria; Kitchen, Neil; Smith, Martin","Traumatic brain injury causes diffuse axonal injury and loss of cortical neurons. These features are well recognized histologically, but their in vivo monitoring remains challenging. In vivo cortical microdialysis samples the extracellular fluid adjacent to neurons and axons. Here, we describe a novel neuronal proteolytic pathway and demonstrate the exclusive neuro-axonal expression of Pavlov's enterokinase. Enterokinase is membrane bound and cleaves the neurofilament heavy chain at positions 476 and 986. Using a 100 kDa microdialysis cut-off membrane the two proteolytic breakdown products, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chains NfH(476-986) and NfH(476-1026), can be quantified with a relative recovery of 20%. In a prospective clinical in vivo study, we included 10 patients with traumatic brain injury with a median Glasgow Coma Score of 9, providing 640 cortical extracellular fluid samples for longitudinal data analysis. Following high-velocity impact traumatic brain injury, microdialysate extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were significantly higher (6.18 +/- 2.94 ng/ml) and detectable for longer (> 4 days) compared with traumatic brain injury secondary to falls (0.84 +/- 1.77 ng/ml, < 2 days). During the initial 16 h following traumatic brain injury, strong correlations were found between extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels and physiological parameters (systemic blood pressure, anaerobic cerebral metabolism, excessive brain tissue oxygenation, elevated brain temperature). Finally, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were of prognostic value, predicting mortality with an odds ratio of 7.68 (confidence interval 2.15-27.46, P = 0.001). In conclusion, this study describes the discovery of Pavlov's enterokinase in the human brain, a novel neuronal proteolytic pathway that gives rise to specific protein biomarkers (NfH(476-986) and Nf(H476-1026)) applicable to in vivo monitoring of diffuse axonal injury and neuronal loss in traumatic brain injury.",2011,/,Brain : a journal of neurology,134,Pt 2,464-83,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq360,21278408,#9353,Petzold 2011,,yes
Death after head injury: the 13 year outcome of a case control study.,"McMillan, T M; Teasdale, G M; Weir, C J; Stewart, E","BACKGROUND: Head injury is common, and the risk of subsequent disability and death is high. Increased risk of death years after injury might be explained by factors associated with, but not a consequence of, the head injury. This unique prospective study investigates mortality over 13 years after injury., METHODS: A cohort of n=767 with head injury was compared with two case control groups, matched for age, gender and deprivation, and in one control group, matched for duration of hospital admission following (non-head) injury., RESULTS: Two-fifths of the head injury cohort had died. The death rate (30.99 per 1000 per year) was much higher than in community controls (13.72 per 1000 per year). More than 1 year after injury, the death rate in younger (15-54 years) adults was much higher than in community controls (17.36 vs. 2.36 per 1000 per year) whereas in older adults the difference was more marginal (61.47 vs. 42.36). Death rate was elevated after mild and after more severe head injury, including in younger adults after mild head injury (14.82 per 1000 per year mild head injury vs. 2.21 community). Female gender and greater deprivation were not associated with increased death rates after head injury. Late after injury, deaths occurred from the same main causes as for the general population., CONCLUSION: Head injury is associated with increased vulnerability to death from a variety of causes for at least 13 years after hospital admission. There is a need to understand how head injury influences mortality, particularly in younger adults and after mild head injury.",2011,/,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",82,8,931-5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2010.222232,21282727,#9352,McMillan 2011,,yes
Computed tomography and outcome in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: hematoma volume and midline shift revisited.,"Jacobs, Bram; Beems, Tjemme; van der Vliet, Ton M; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon R; Borm, George F; Vos, Pieter E","Intracranial lesion volume and midline shift are powerful outcome predictors in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and therefore they are used in TBI and computed tomography (CT) classification schemes, like the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) classification. In this study we aimed to explore the prognostic value of lesion volume and midline shift in moderate and severe TBI as measured from acute cranial CT scans. Also, we wanted to determine interrater reliability for the evaluation of these CT abnormalities. We included all consecutive moderate and severe TBI patients admitted to our hospital who were aged >=16 years, over an 8-year period, as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study. Six months post-trauma we assessed outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). We analyzed 605 patients and found an association of both lesion volume and midline shift with outcome; increases were associated with a higher frequency of patients with an unfavorable outcome or death. A cut-off value, such as that used in the TCDB CT classification (lesion volume 25 mL and midline shift 5 mm), was not found. The average interrater difference in volume measurement was 6.8 mL, and it was 0.2 mm for the determination of degree of shift. Using lesion volume and midline shift as continuous variables in prognostic models might be preferable over the use of threshold values, although an association of these variables with outcome in relation to other CT abnormalities was not tested.

Acute kidney injury in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: implementation of the acute kidney injury network stage system.,"Li, Ning; Zhao, Wei-Guo; Zhang, Wei-Feng","BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the incidence and effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although AKI may affect outcome. Recently, acute kidney injury network (AKIN) classification has been widely accepted as a consensus definition for AKI. The aim of this study is to estimate the frequency and level of severity of AKI in patients with severe TBI by using AKIN criteria and to study whether AKI affects outcome., METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified a total of 136 patients with severe TBI admitted to the neurosurgical center during a 3-year period ending May 2010. Demographic data, severity of TBI, serum creatinine, urine output, outcome at 6 month, and death were collected. Renal function was assessed by using AKIN criteria., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (23%) were classified as having AKI by using AKIN criteria during their hospitalization. Of them, 21 patients (68%) were stratified as stage 1, 7 patients (22%) as stage 2, and 3 patients (10%) as stage 3. Patients who developed AKI were older, had lower Glasgow coma scale at admission, and had higher level of admission serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Patients with AKI had higher mortality and worse outcome when compared with patients with normal renal function. Furthermore, patients with mild renal dysfunction (stage 1 AKI) are also found having increased mortality and worse long-term outcome, compared with patients without renal dysfunction., CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated using the newly defined AKIN criteria for renal dysfunction that AKI is a relatively common feature in patients with severe TBI, and even seemingly insignificant decrease in renal function may be associated with worse outcome.

Patients were divided into groups on the basis of status of CPA (more pressure active vs more pressure passive) and level of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP; low vs high CPP). The proportions of favorable outcome in the groups were assessed. Differences in physiological variables in the different groups were analyzed., RESULTS: Patients with more impaired CPA treated at CPP levels below median had a significantly higher proportion of favorable outcome compared with patients with more impaired CPA treated at CPP levels above median. No significant difference in outcome was seen between patients with more intact CPA when divided by level of CPP. In patients with more impaired CPA, CPP<50 mm Hg and CPP<60 mm Hg were associated with favorable outcome, whereas CPP>70 mm Hg and CPP>80 mm Hg were associated with unfavorable outcome.

Significance of minor traumatic lesions in focal head injuries.,"Yanagawa, Youichi; Sakamoto, Toshihisa",We investigated the significance of minor traumatic lesions associated with focal head injuries. Patients included in the study were admitted between January 2003 and December 2007 and had sustained a head injury with focal injury and undergone MRI examination including T2(*)-weighted imaging. Patients were divided into two groups: (i) a T2(*)-positive group - those who had hypointense lesions at sites other than the original injury site as shown by T2(*)-weighted MRI (n=12); and (ii) a control group without hypointense lesions at sites other than the original injury (n=25). The median Glasgow Outcome Scale score was significantly lower in the T2(*)-positive group (median=4; range=4-5) than in the control group (median=5; range=4-5; p=0.003). We conclude that patients with a focal head injury and minor traumatic lesions are likely to have a poorer prognosis than patients without additional minor traumatic lesions.

Patients were grouped according to the outcome: (1) nonsurvival (n=5): patients who died; (2) survival A (n=15): CSF sampled between 1st and 3rd day from patients who survived after hospital admission; and (3) survival B (n=7): CSF sampled between 4th and 7th day from patients who survived after hospital admission and were maintained with intraventricular catheter up to 7 days., RESULTS: Up to 3 days, S100B and NSE levels (ng/mL) were significantly elevated in the nonsurvival compared with survival A group (S100: 12.45 +/- 5.46 vs 5.64 +/- 3.36; NSE: 313.20 +/- 45.51 vs 107.80 +/- 112.10). GFAP levels did not differ between groups. In the survival B group S100B, GFAP, and NSE levels were still elevated compared with control (4.59 +/- 2.19, 2.48 +/- 2.55, and 89.80 +/- 131.10, respectively). To compare S100B and NSE for the prediction of nonsurvival and survival patients we performed receiver operating characteristic curves. At admission, CSF NSE level predicts brain death more accurately than S100B., CONCLUSION: Early elevations (up to 3 days) of S100B and NSE secondary to severe TBI predict deterioration to brain death. However, this feature was more prominently associated with NSE than S100B.

Diffusivity of normal-appearing tissue in acute traumatic brain injury.,"Brandstack, N; Kurki, T; Hiekkanen, H; Tenovuo, O","BACKGROUND: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about traumatic changes not visible in conventional MRI. The ADC values in acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) were measured and correlated with initial severity and outcome scores., METHODS: In this study 22 unselected patients were studied 1 week (mean 7 +/- 2 days) after TBI of variable severity. In conventional MRI 7 patients were without visible findings, 15 showed cortical contusions or traumatic axonal injury and 14 healthy subjects served as controls. The ADC values were measured from 46 brain regions away from the visible traumatic changes and compared between the groups. Regional ADC values and the number of abnormal regions were correlated with the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on arrival in hospital and the Glasgow outcome scale (extended version, GOS-E) at 1 year after injury., RESULTS: The ADC values of TBI patients with and without visible lesions did not show any differences but both groups differed significantly from the controls in several cortical and deep brain regions. Increased ADC values were common in TBI groups but decreased ADC values were relatively uncommon. The regional ADC values and the number of abnormal regions did not correlate with either GCS or GOS-E scores., CONCLUSIONS: Increased diffusion in normal appearing brain tissue is a common finding 1 week after TBI in patients with and without visible lesions in conventional MRI. More investigations are needed to evaluate how these findings could be used for clinical applications.",2011,/,Clinical neuroradiology,21,2,75-82,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00062-011-0058-5,21394634,#9301,Brandstack 2011,,yes
Prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in moderate and severe head injury: a prospective study of early MRI findings and one-year outcome.,"Skandsen, Toril; Kvistad, Kjell Arne; Solheim, Ole; Lydersen, Stian; Strand, Ingrid Haavde; Vik, Anne","The clinical benefit of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in severe and moderate head injury is unclear. We sought to explore the prognostic value of the depth of lesions depicted with early MRI, and also to describe the prevalence and impact of traumatic brainstem lesions. In a cohort of 159 consecutive patients with moderate to severe head injury (age 5-65 years and surviving the acute phase) admitted to a regional level 1 trauma center, 106 (67%) were examined with MRI within 4 weeks post-injury. Depth of lesions in MRI was categorized as: hemisphere level, central level, and brainstem injury (BSI). The outcome measure was Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) 12 months post-injury. Forty-six percent of patients with severe injuries and 14% of patients with moderate injuries had BSI. In severe head injury, central or brainstem lesions in MRI, together with higher Rotterdam CT score, pupillary dilation, and secondary adverse events were significantly associated with a worse outcome in age-adjusted analyses. Bilateral BSI was strongly associated with a poor outcome in severe injury, with positive and negative predictive values of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. In moderate injury, only age was significantly associated with outcome in multivariable analyses. Limitations of the current study include lack of blinded outcome evaluations and insufficient statistical power to assess the added prognostic value of MRI when combined with clinical information. We conclude that in patients with severe head injury surviving the acute phase, depth of lesion on the MRI was associated with outcome, and in particular, bilateral brainstem injury was strongly associated with poor outcomes. In moderate head injury, surprisingly, there was no association between MRI findings and outcome when using the GOSE score as outcome measure.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,5,691-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1590,21401308,#9300,Skandsen 2011,,yes
Risk factors for reduced survival after traumatic brain injury: a 30-year follow-up study.,"Himanen, Leena; Portin, Raija; Hamalainen, Paivi; Hurme, Saija; Hiekkanen, Heli; Tenovuo, Olli","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for reduced survival in subjects with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A retrospective follow-up of three decades included 192 subjects with TBI. Cognitive testing was carried out on average 2 years after the injury (at mean age of 39.0 years), during the years 1966-1972. Cox's regression and logistic regression analyses were used and the survival of the subjects was compared with the general population using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR)., RESULTS: Reduced survival was significantly associated with age at injury (p < 0.001) and vocational outcome (p = 0.003). Vocational outcome in turn was associated with age (p = 0.010), TBI severity (p < 0.001), cognitive impairment (p = 0.010), later TBIs (p = 0.007) and alcohol abuse (p = 0.015). Mortality in the younger patient group (age at death <40 years) was higher than in the general population (SMR 4.50, 95% CI = 2.02-10.01)., CONCLUSIONS: A reduced working ability, influenced by age-, injury- and lifestyle-related factors, is associated with long-term survival after TBI.

The association between anemia and the mortality of severe traumatic brain injury in emergency department.,"Yang, Chia-Jung; Hsiao, Kuang-Yu; Su, I-Chun; Chen, I-Chuan","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common medical problem for critically ill patients. Blood transfusion to augment oxygen delivery for these patients has been a traditional therapy. However, few studies have identified the impact of anemia on individuals suffering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effects of initial anemia on patients with severe TBI admitted to the Emergency Unit., METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with isolated severe TBI admitted to the Emergency Unit of a university hospital from July 2003 to June 2008. Patients were divided into two groups based on their initial anemia data taken while in the Emergency Unit. The anemia datum is defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <10 mg/dL. The t test was used to identify the differences between the two groups, while logistic regression was applied to determine any significant differences found in the statistical analysis., RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were signed up in our study. Based on their initial hemoglobin at emergency department, 23 patients (9.8%) comprised the anemia group, 17 patients (7.3%) comprised the nonanemia group, whereas 112 patients (47.9%) belonging to the nonanemia group were deceased. There is no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.076; odds ratio, 0.97; confidence interval, 0.78-1.05)., CONCLUSION: This study shows that initial anemia is not a mortality risk factor for patients with isolated severe blunt TBI.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,71,6,E132-5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31820ea36b,21427611,#9291,Yang 2011,,yes
Effect of secondary prehospital risk factors on outcome in severe traumatic brain injury in the context of fast access to trauma care.,"Franschman, Gaby; Peerdeman, Saskia M; Andriessen, Teuntje M J C; Greuters, Sjoerd; Toor, Annelies E; Vos, Pieter E; Bakker, Fred C; Loer, Stephan A; Boer, Christa; Amsterdam Lifeliner: Analysis of Results and Methods--Traumatic Brain Injury (ALARM-TBI) Investigators","BACKGROUND: Prevention of secondary prehospital risk factors such as hypoxia and hypotension is likely to improve patient prognosis in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because the Dutch trauma care organization is characterized by fast access to specialized trauma care due to the geographical situation, we investigated whether and to what extend secondary risk factors, such as hypoxia and hypotension, and measures, such as endotracheal intubation, affect outcome in severe TBI in the context of a region with fast access to trauma care., METHODS: The medical records of 339 subsequent computed tomography-confirmed patients with TBI with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score<=8 who were primarily referred to a Level I trauma center in Amsterdam or Nijmegen in the Netherlands were retrospectively analyzed., RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the strongest outcome predictors in our population were a disturbed pupillary reflex (odds ratio [OR], 5.8), a GCS score of 3 (OR, 4.9), and arterial hypotension (OR, 3.5). Interestingly, we observed no differences between intubated and nonintubated patients with respect to metabolic and respiratory parameters or mortality whereby the injury severity score was slightly higher in endotracheally intubated patients (32 [25-41]) versus nonintubated patients (25 [22-29])., CONCLUSION: In agreement with others, GCS, a disturbed pupil reflex, and arterial hypotension were predictive for the prognosis of primarily referred patients with severe TBI in the Netherlands. In contrast, in the perspective of slightly higher injury scores in intubated patients, prehospital endotracheal intubation was not predictive for patient outcome.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,71,4,826-32,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31820cebf0,21427618,#9290,Franschman 2011,,yes
Validation of the IMPACT outcome prediction score using the Nottingham Head Injury Register dataset.,"Yeoman, Paddy; Pattani, Hina; Silcocks, Paul; Owen, Victoria; Fuller, Gordon","BACKGROUND: Comparison of traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes is severely limited by the absence of a universally accepted and validated outcome prediction score. The IMPACT group recently reported models predicting mortality and unfavorable outcome after TBI, based on the outcomes of patients with moderate and severe head injury reported in two large clinical trials., METHODS: We have used prospectively collected data from 1,276 adult patients from the Nottingham Head Injury Register admitted to a single UK neurosurgical unit during a 10-year period to validate the IMPACT score models. The two models were validated for discrimination, calibration, and accuracy, using multiple imputation to adjust for missing data., RESULTS: One thousand sixty-one patients (83%) had a complete set of data. For the multiply imputed analysis, the IMPACT prognostic models showed satisfactory discrimination (area under the receiver operator curve for mortality, 0.835; 95% confidence interval, 0.811-0.858; unfavorable outcome, 0.828; 95% confidence interval, 0.805-0.851) and accuracy (Brier Accuracy Score for mortality, 0.403, p < 0.01; unfavorable outcome, 0.371, p < 0.01). Good calibration was evident for unfavorable outcome, but mortality risk was underestimated by the scoring system in our sample (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: mortality: p < 0.01; unfavorable outcome: p = 0.6). These results were not significantly changed when repeated using patients with complete data only., CONCLUSION: The 2005 IMPACT model for unfavorable outcome performs well when used to predict outcome in adults with moderate and severe TBI presenting to a British neurosurgical center. However, the model for mortality fitted less well, slightly overestimating mortality in the higher-risk groups.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,71,2,387-92,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31820ceadd,21427619,#9289,Yeoman 2011,,yes
CSF Bcl-2 and cytochrome C temporal profiles in outcome prediction for adults with severe TBI.,"Wagner, Amy K; Amin, Krutika B; Niyonkuru, Christian; Postal, Brett A; McCullough, Emily H; Ozawa, Haishin; Dixon, C Edward; Bayir, Hulya; Clark, Robert S; Kochanek, Patrick M; Fabio, Anthony","The biochemical cascades associated with cell death after traumatic brain injury (TBI) involve both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins. We hypothesized that elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Bcl-2 and cytochrome C (CytoC) levels over time would reflect cellular injury response and predict long-term outcomes after TBI. Cerebrospinal fluid Bcl-2 and CytoC levels were measured for 6 days after injury for adults with severe TBI (N=76 subjects; N=277 samples). Group-based trajectory analysis was used to generate distinct temporal biomarker profiles that were compared with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores at 6 and 12 months after TBI. Subjects with persistently elevated temporal Bcl-2 and CytoC profiles compared with healthy controls had the worst outcomes at 6 and 12 months (P<=0.027). Those with CytoC profiles near controls had better long-term outcomes, and those with declining CytoC levels over time had intermediate outcomes. Subjects with Bcl-2 profiles that remained near controls had better outcomes than those with consistently elevated Bcl-2 profiles. However, subjects with Bcl-2 values that started near controls and steadily rose over time had 100% good outcomes by 12 months after TBI. These results show the prognostic value of Bcl-2 and CytoC profiles and suggest a dynamic apoptotic and pro-survival response to TBI.",2011,/,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,31,9,1886-96,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2011.31,21448217,#9280,Wagner 2011,,yes
Endothelial progenitor cells correlate with clinical outcome of traumatic brain injury.,"Liu, Li; Wei, Huijie; Chen, Fanglian; Wang, Jinghua; Dong, Jing-fei; Zhang, Jianning","OBJECTIVE: Endothelial progenitor cells play an active role in vascular repair and revascularization of tissue damaged by traumatic, inflammatory, and ischemic injures. We correlate the changes in circulating endothelial progenitor cells with the severity of traumatic brain injury. The study is designed to investigate the endothelial progenitor cell mobilization after injury and a potential use of circulating endothelial progenitor cells as a prognostic marker for evaluating trauma severity and clinical outcomes., DESIGN: A prospective cohort study conducted in two neurosurgical intensive care units of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Tianjin Huanhu Hospital (Tianjin, China)., PATIENTS: Patients with traumatic brain injury and age- and gender-matched healthy controls., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changes in the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells were monitored for up to 21 days in 84 patients with traumatic brain injury. Results were correlated with the clinical assessment of injury severity as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale. The level of circulating endothelial progenitor cells was found to be suppressed 24-48 hrs after injury but rapidly increased, reaching the highest at days 5-7 post-trauma. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with improved Glasgow Coma Scale scores were significantly higher than those with deteriorated conditions and remained persistently low in patients who died of trauma., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the level of circulating endothelial progenitor cells correlates with the clinical severity and outcome of traumatic brain injury and may offer potential as a prognostic marker for traumatic brain injury.

Recent imaging advances made its diagnosis easier. Its prognosis impact is not yet well established. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic features of posttraumatic DAI and to study its prognosis impact on mortality and outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale., METHODS: This is a retrospective study over a 4-year period (2004-2007) of 124 patients admitted for head trauma. Demographic, clinical, biological, and radiologic findings were recorded at admission and during intensive care unit stay., RESULTS: Mean age (+/-standard deviation) was 28 years+/-15.8 years. Cranial computed tomography scan was sufficient enough to diagnose DAI in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 105 patients with a delay of 7.7 days+/-8.6 days. Most patients were classified as stage II (49.5%) or stage III (44.8%) according to Gentry's classification. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher mortality were dysautonomia (p=0.018; odds ratio [OR]=4.17), hyperglycemia>=8 mmol/L (p=0.001; OR=3.84) on intensive care unit admission, and subdural hematoma (p=0.031; OR=3.99), whereas factors associated to poor outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale score were Glasgow Coma Scale score<8 (p=0.032, OR=3.55), secondary systemic injuries score>=3 (p=0.034, OR=2.83), hyperglycemia>=8 mmol/L (p=0.002, OR=5.55), and DAI count>=6 (p=0.035, OR=3.33). In patients with pure DAI, the absence of consciousness recovery was the unique independent factor of mortality (p<0.001, OR=116.4), whereas only transfusion need was an independent factor of poor outcome (p=0.017, OR=4.44)., CONCLUSION: Dysautonomia, hyperglycemia, and subdural hematoma are the main factors associated to higher mortality when DAIs are diagnosed, whereas a DAI count>=6 is associated to poor outcome.

Spreading depolarizations have prolonged direct current shifts and are associated with poor outcome in brain trauma.,"Hartings, Jed A; Watanabe, Tomas; Bullock, M Ross; Okonkwo, David O; Fabricius, Martin; Woitzik, Johannes; Dreier, Jens P; Puccio, Ava; Shutter, Lori A; Pahl, Clemens; Strong, Anthony J; Co-Operative Study on Brain Injury Depolarizations","Cortical spreading depolarizations occur spontaneously after ischaemic, haemorrhagic and traumatic brain injury. Their effects vary spatially and temporally as graded phenomena, from infarction to complete recovery, and are reflected in the duration of depolarization measured by the negative direct current shift of electrocorticographic recordings. In the focal ischaemic penumbra, peri-infarct depolarizations have prolonged direct current shifts and cause progressive recruitment of the penumbra into the core infarct. In traumatic brain injury, the effects of spreading depolarizations are unknown, although prolonged events have not been observed in animal models. To determine whether detrimental penumbral-type depolarizations occur in human brain trauma, we analysed electrocorticographic recordings obtained by subdural electrode-strip monitoring during intensive care. Of 53 patients studied, 10 exhibited spreading depolarizations in an electrophysiologic penumbra (i.e. isoelectric cortex with no spontaneous activity). All 10 patients (100%) with isoelectric spreading depolarizations had poor outcomes, defined as death, vegetative state, or severe disability at 6 months. In contrast, poor outcomes were observed in 60% of patients (12/20) who had spreading depolarizations with depression of spontaneous activity and only 26% of patients (6/23) who had no depolarizations (chi2, P<0.001). Spontaneous electrocorticographic activity and direct current shifts of depolarizations were further examined in nine patients. Direct current shift durations (n=295) were distributed with a significant positive skew (range 0:51-16:19 min:s), evidencing a normally distributed group of short events and a sub-group of prolonged events. Prolonged direct current shifts were more commonly associated with isoelectric depolarizations (median 2 min 36 s), whereas shorter depolarizations occurred with depression of spontaneous activity (median 2 min 10 s; P<0.001). In the latter group, direct current shift durations correlated with electrocorticographic depression periods, and were longer when preceded by periodic epileptiform discharges than by continuous delta (0.5-4.0 Hz) or higher frequency activity. Prolonged direct current shifts (>3 min) also occurred mainly within temporal clusters of events. Our results show for the first time that spreading depolarizations are associated with worse clinical outcome after traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, based on animal models of brain injury, the prolonged durations of depolarizations raise the possibility that these events may contribute to maturation of cortical lesions. Prolonged depolarizations, measured by negative direct current shifts, were associated with (i) isoelectricity or periodic epileptiform discharges; (ii) prolonged depression of spontaneous activity and (iii) occurrence in temporal clusters. Depolarizations with these characteristics are likely to reflect a worse prognosis.",2011,/,Brain : a journal of neurology,134,Pt 5,1529-40,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr048,21478187,#9267,Hartings 2011,,yes
Genu of corpus callosum in diffuse axonal injury induces a worse 1-year outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Matsukawa, Hidetoshi; Shinoda, Masaki; Fujii, Motoharu; Takahashi, Osamu; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Murakata, Atsushi; Ishikawa, Ryoichi","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown a relationship between diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it remains unclear whether the type of DAI lesion influences outcome after TBI.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between clinical characteristics and outcome for each type of DAI lesion and each type of CC lesion in patients with TBI., FINDINGS: Sixty-nine patients had DAI lesions: 34 in the lobar region, 30 in the CC, and five in the brainstem. Of the 30 patients with CC lesions, ten each were found in the genu, body, and splenium. Each DAI, CC, and genu lesion was significantly associated with unfavorable outcome 1 year after TBI by multivariate analysis using variables that were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome as determined by univariate analysis after adjustment for age., CONCLUSIONS: CC lesions, especially those in the genu, were related to unfavorable 1-year outcome in patients with TBI.",2011,/,Acta neurochirurgica,153,8,1687-4,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-011-1002-9,21479582,#9265,Matsukawa 2011,,yes
