Serum thioredoxin and in-hospital major adverse events after traumatic brain injury.,"Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Yu, Wen-Hua; Zhang, Zu-Yong; Yang, Ding-Bo; Du, Quan; Wang, Hao; Shen, Yong-Feng; Jiang, Li; Che, Zhi-Hao; Zhu, Qiang","BACKGROUND: In-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs), mainly including acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction, are associated with poor prognosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thioredoxin, a potent anti-oxidant, has been identified as an oxidative stress marker. This study was designed to explore the association of serum thioredoxin concentrations with IMAEs of patients with severe TBI., METHODS: This prospective, observational study recruited a total of 108 healthy controls and 108 patients with severe TBI. We investigated the possible relation of serum thioredoxin concentrations to IMAEs and trauma severity (reflected by Glasgow coma scale scores) following TBI using a multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Serum thioredoxin concentrations were higher in the patients than in the controls. Serum concentrations of thioredoxin significantly correlated with admission Glasgow coma scale scores. Thioredoxin in serum independently predicted any IMAEs. As compared to admission Glasgow coma scale scores, thioredoxin concentrations had similar areas under receiver operating characteristic curve for any IMAEs., CONCLUSION: Increased serum thioredoxin concentrations are highly associated with trauma severity and IMAEs, indicating thioredoxin might be a potential prognostic biomarker after TBI.

Prognostic model for patients with traumatic brain injuries and abnormal computed tomography scans.,"Junior, Jefferson Rosi; Welling, Leonardo C; Schafranski, Marcelo; Yeng, Lin Tchia; do Prado, Rogerio Ruscito; Koterba, Edwin; de Andrade, Almir Ferreira; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen; Figueiredo, Eberval Gadelha","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. The prognosis evaluation is a challenge when many variables are involved. The authors aimed to develop prognostic model for assessment of survival chances after TBI based on admission characteristics, including extracranial injuries, which would allow application of the model before in-hospital therapeutic interventions. A cohort study evaluated 1275 patients with TBI and abnormal CT scans upon admission to the emergency unit of Hospital das Clinicas of University of Sao Paulo and analyzed the final outcome on mortality. A logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine the adjusted weigh of each independent variable in the outcome. Four variables were found to be significant in the model: age (years), Glasgow Coma Scale (3-15), Marshall Scale (MS, stratified into 2,3 or 4,5,6; according to the best group positive predictive value) and anysochoria (yes/no). The following formula is in a logistic model (USP index to head injury) estimates the probability of death of patients according to characteristics that influence on mortality. We consider that our mathematical probability model (USP Index) may be applied to clinical prognosis in patients with abnormal CT scans after severe traumatic brain injury.

Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations correlate with prognosis of traumatic brain injury.,"Yang, Ding-Bo; Yu, Wen-Hua; Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Zhang, Zu-Yong; Du, Quan; Zhu, Qiang; Che, Zhi-Hao; Wang, Hao; Shen, Yong-Feng; Jiang, Li","BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine. Serum MIF concentrations are associated with the severity and prognosis of ischemic stroke., METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and MIF among 108 severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and 108 controls were measured. We determined whether serum MIF concentrations are associated with inflammation, severity, in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) (i.e., in-hospital mortality, acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction) and long-term clinical outcome (i.e., 6-month functional outcome) after TBI., RESULTS: As compared to the controls, serum CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MIF concentrations were significantly increased. MIF concentrations correlated with WBC count, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores. MIF in serum was independently associated with IMAEs and long-term clinical outcome. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve of MIF concentrations was similar to GCS scores'. Moreover, MIF concentrations markedly improved the predictive value of GCS scores for 6-month unfavorable outcome., CONCLUSION: Increased serum MIF concentrations have close relation to inflammation, trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing MIF as a good prognostic biomarker after TBI.

A prospective outcome study observing patients with severe traumatic brain injury over 10-15 years.,"Andersson, E; Rackauskaite, D; Svanborg, E; Csajbok, L; Ost, M; Nellgard, B","BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) can be divided into primary and secondary injuries. Intensive care protocols focus on preventing secondary injuries. This prospective cohort study was initiated to investigate outcome, including mortality, in patients treated according to the Lund Concept after a sTBI covering 10-15 years post-trauma., METHODS: Patients were included during 2000-2004 when admitted to the neurointensive care unit, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were: Glasgow coma scale score of <=8, need for artificial ventilation and intracranial monitoring. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to evaluate outcome both at 1-year and 10-15 years post-trauma., RESULTS: Ninety-five patients, (27 female and 68 male), were initially included. Both improvement and deterioration were noted between 1- and 10-15 years post-injury. Mortality rate (34/95) was higher in the studied population vs. a matched Swedish population, (Standard mortality rate (SMR) 9.5; P < 0.0001). When dividing the cohort into Good (GOS 4-5) and Poor (GOS 2-3) outcome at 1-year, only patients with Poor outcome had a higher mortality rate than the matched population (SMR 7.3; P < 0.0001). Further, good outcome (high GOS) at 1-year was associated with high GOS 10-15 years post-trauma (P < 0.0001). Finally, a majority of patients demonstrated symptoms of mental fatigue., CONCLUSION: This indicates that patients with severe traumatic brain injury with Good outcome at 1-year have similar survival probability as a matched Swedish population and that high Glasgow outcome scale at 1-year is related to good long-term outcome. Our results further emphasise the advantage of the Lund concept. Copyright © 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Is It Reliable to Predict the Outcome of Elderly Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Using the IMPACT Prognostic Calculator?.,"Wan, Xueyan; Zhao, Kai; Wang, Sheng; Zhang, Huaqiu; Zeng, Liang; Wang, Yu; Han, Lin; Beejadhursing, Rajluxmee; Shu, Kai; Lei, Ting","BACKGROUND: Many investigators endeavor to predict the outcome based on admission characteristics using some established models to determine which management should be applied. However, the efficacy and applicability of the models using in the geriatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not yet been evaluated., METHODS: A total of 137 geriatric severe TBI patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the efficacy and usability of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model in evaluating the prognosis for these patients., RESULTS: The observed mortality and unfavorable outcomes at 6 months in patients with severe TBI were 54.7% and 70.8%, respectively, slightly lower than the predicted outcomes using the IMPACT model. ROC curve analysis showed areas under the curve (AUCs) for mortality of 0.76 and for unfavorable outcome of 0.80 in the Core model, of 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, in the Extended model, and of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively, in the Lab model. When expected risk of fatal outcome was >90% in any model, the true positive rate was 100%. Moreover, when the predicted risk for unfavorable outcomes was >70% in any model, the actual rate of unfavorable outcomes was >80%., CONCLUSIONS: The IMPACT prognosis calculator showed just fair discrimination when predicting the outcome of the elderly patients with severe TBI. Management decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis rather than by relying on the predicted risks identified by this model; conservative treatment might be preferable when expected risk of fatal outcome is >90%.

[Predictors of the recovery of cognitive functions in patients with traumatic brain injury].,"Solis-Marcos, I; Castellano-Guerrero, A M; Dominguez-Morales, R; Leon-Carrion, J","INTRODUCTION: After a traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive functionality may be severely altered. Some studies have aimed at identifying the best predictive variables for cognitive recovery, however, results still remain unclear., AIMS: To assess the recovery of cognitive functionality in TBI patients after a rehabilitation programme, and to identify the variables that best predict the cognitive recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective pre-post study with 58 adult TBI patients that underwent an intensive rehabilitation programme. All of them were assessed using the cognitive functions sub-scale from the FIM+FAM scale, at admission and discharge. Both scores were compared using non-parametric test Wilcoxon. Cognitive functionality gain percentage was calculated and correlated with all the collected data. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to identify the best predictors of cognitive functionality gain percentage by introducing all clinical, demographic and cognitive information., RESULTS: The group's cognitive functionality increased significantly from 33,6% to 85% (p < 0,01). Patients with higher cognitive functionality gain percentage were those with younger age, shorter time post-TBI, and higher scores on cognitive functions sub-scale, conditional attention and Luria's memory word tests. The best predictors for cognitive functionality gain percentage were time post-TBI and cognitive functions at admission (adjusted R(2) = 55,8%)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients who started rehabilitation sooner and had a higher cognitive functionality at admission, showed the greatest increase in cognitive functionality gain percentage. Other variables like age, or scores on cognitive tests must also be considered in future studies.",2014,/,Revista de neurologia,58,7,296-302,,,24677152,#7785,Solis-Marcos 2014,,yes
Early CT findings to predict early death in patients with traumatic brain injury: Marshall and Rotterdam CT scoring systems compared in the major academic tertiary care hospital in northeastern Japan.,"Mata-Mbemba, Daddy; Mugikura, Shunji; Nakagawa, Atsuhiro; Murata, Takaki; Ishii, Kiyoshi; Li, Li; Takase, Kei; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Takahashi, Shoki","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in early assessment of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Marshall and Rotterdam are the mostly used scoring systems, in which CT findings are grouped differently. We sought to determine the scoring system and initial CT findings predicting the death at hospital discharge (early death) in patients with TBI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 245 consecutive adult patients with mild-to-severe TBI. Their initial CT and status at hospital discharge (dead or alive) were reviewed, and both CT scores were calculated. We examined whether each score was related to early death; compared the two scoring systems' performance in predicting early death, and identified the CT findings that are independent predictors of early death., RESULTS: More deaths occurred among patients with higher Marshall and Rotterdam scores (both P < .05, Mann-Whitney U test). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) indicated that both scoring systems had similarly good discriminative power in predicting early death (Marshall, AUC = 0. 85 vs. Rotterdam, AUC = 0.85). Basal cistern absence (odds ratio [OR] = 771.5, P < .0001), positive midline shift (OR = 56.2, P = .0011), hemorrhagic mass volume >=25 mL (OR = 12.9, P = .0065), and intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR = 3.8, P = .0395) were independent predictors of early death., CONCLUSIONS: Both Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems can be used to predict early death in patients with TBI. The performance of the Marshall score is at least equal to that of the Rotterdam score. Thus, although older, the Marshall score remains useful in predicting patients' prognosis.

Predicting six-month mortality of patients with traumatic brain injury: usefulness of common intensive care severity scores.,"Raj, Rahul; Skrifvars, Markus; Bendel, Stepani; Selander, Tuomas; Kivisaari, Riku; Siironen, Jari; Reinikainen, Matti","INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores compared to simpler models based on age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in predicting long-term outcome of patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated in the intensive care unit (ICU)., METHODS: A national ICU database was screened for eligible TBI patients (age over 15 years, GCS 3-13) admitted in 2003-2012. Logistic regression was used for customization of APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA score-based models for six-month mortality prediction. These models were compared to an adjusted SOFA-based model (including age) and a reference model (age and GCS). Internal validation was performed by a randomized split-sample technique. Prognostic performance was determined by assessing discrimination, calibration and precision., RESULTS: In total, 1,625 patients were included. The overall six-month mortality was 33%. The APACHE II and SAPS II-based models showed good discrimination (area under the curve (AUC) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.82; and 0.80, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.83, respectively), calibration (P > 0.05) and precision (Brier score 0.166 to 0.167). The SOFA-based model showed poor discrimination (AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.72) and precision (Brier score 0.201) but good calibration (P > 0.05). The AUC of the SOFA-based model was significantly improved after the insertion of age and GCS (AUC +0.11, P < 0.001). The performance of the reference model was comparable to the APACHE II and SAPS II in terms of discrimination (AUC 0.77; compared to APACHE II, DELTAAUC -0.02, P = 0.425; compared to SAPS II, DELTAAUC -0.03, P = 0.218), calibration (P > 0.05) and precision (Brier score 0.181)., CONCLUSIONS: A simple prognostic model, based only on age and GCS, displayed a fairly good prognostic performance in predicting six-month mortality of ICU-treated patients with TBI. The use of the more complex scoring systems APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA added little to the prognostic performance.",2014,/,"Critical care (London, England)",18,2,R60,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc13814,24708781,#7773,Raj 2014,,yes
18FDG-PET/CT in traumatic brain injury patients: the relative hypermetabolism of vermis cerebelli as a medium and long term predictor of outcome.,"Lupi, Andrea; Bertagnoni, Giannettore; Borghero, Anna; Picelli, Alessandro; Cuccurullo, Vincenzo; Zanco, Pierluigi","PURPOSE: Both, the constant presence of apparent hypermetabolism of the vermis cerebelli compared to the cerebellar hemispheres in traumatic brain injury, and the presence of a good relationship between the intensity of this sign and the severity of the clinical conditions have been addressed in previous studies. Aim of the present paper is to evaluate the possible correlation between the intensity of the finding and the medium and long term outcome in a group of patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 105 patients consecutively admitted to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Center of our Hospital between 2005 and 2012 was studied with a 18FDG-PET/CT study of the brain after head trauma; the metabolic activity of the cerebellar vermis was semiquantitatively assessed (vermis/cerebellum ratio, V/C). After that, all patients received systematic monitoring of their performance status via the timely administration of commonly used tests (DRS, LCF and GOS) during one whole year after the head trauma. The V/C parameter was compared with the evolution of performance abilities, as shown by the rating scales., RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed a significant direct association between the V/C ratio and the DRS score at each time point (3 months: P<0.001; 6 months: P<0.001; 12 months: P<0.001) and significant inverse association with the LCF score (3 months: P<0.001; 6 months: P<0.001; 12 months: P<0.001) and the GOS score (3 months: P<0.001; 6 months: P<0.001; 12 months: P<0.001) at each time point. Moreover, patients with a V/C ratio >= 1 have a significantly greater probability to achieve a good functional outcome as defined by a DRS score >= 3 points, a LCF score >= 7 points and and a GOS score =5 points., CONCLUSIONS: In our group of patients, the V/C parameter has demonstrated to be a predictor of outcome. If validated by more extensive experiences, this approach could offer the possibility of performing a reliable prognostic evaluation in a notoriously ""difficult"" class of patients with an acceptable technique and economical effort.",2014,/,Current radiopharmaceuticals,7,1,57-62,,,24725131,#7768,Lupi 2014,,yes
Association between serum tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels and mortality in patients with severe brain trauma injury.,"Lorente, Leonardo; Martin, Maria M; Lopez, Patricia; Ramos, Luis; Blanquer, Jose; Caceres, Juan J; Sole-Violan, Jordi; Solera, Jorge; Cabrera, Judith; Argueso, Monica; Ortiz, Raquel; Mora, Maria L; Lubillo, Santiago; Jimenez, Alejandro; Borreguero-Leon, Juan M; Gonzalez, Agustin; Orbe, Josune; Rodriguez, Jose A; Paramo, Jose A","OBJECTIVE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play a role in neuroinflammation after brain trauma injury (TBI). Previous studies with small sample size have reported higher circulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in patients with TBI, but no association between those levels and mortality. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether serum TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels are associated with mortality in patients with severe TBI., METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational and prospective study carried out in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Patients with severe TBI defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lower than 9 were included, while those with Injury Severity Score (ISS) in non-cranial aspects higher than 9 were excluded. Serum levels of TIMP-1, MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and plasma levels of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 plasma were measured in 100 patients with severe TBI at admission. Endpoint was 30-day mortality., RESULTS: Non-surviving TBI patients (n = 27) showed higher serum TIMP-1 levels than survivor ones (n = 73). We did not find differences in MMP-9 serum levels. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum TIMP-1 levels were associated 30-day mortality (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 1.001-1.013; P = 0.03). Survival analysis showed that patients with serum TIMP-1 higher than 220 ng/mL presented increased 30-day mortality than patients with lower levels (Chi-square = 5.50; P = 0.02). The area under the curve (AUC) for TIMP-1 as predictor of 30-day mortality was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.624-0.844; P<0.001). An association between TIMP-1 levels and APACHE-II score, TNF- alpha and TF was found., CONCLUSIONS: The most relevant and new findings of our study, the largest series reporting data on TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels in patients with severe TBI, were that serum TIMP-1 levels were associated with TBI mortality and could be used as a prognostic biomarker of mortality in TBI patients.",2014,/,PloS one,9,4,e94370,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094370,24728097,#7766,Lorente 2014,,yes
Diffusion tensor imaging for outcome prediction in mild traumatic brain injury: a TRACK-TBI study.,"Yuh, Esther L; Cooper, Shelly R; Mukherjee, Pratik; Yue, John K; Lingsma, Hester F; Gordon, Wayne A; Valadka, Alex B; Okonkwo, David O; Schnyer, David M; Vassar, Mary J; Maas, Andrew I R; Manley, Geoffrey T; TRACK-TBI INVESTIGATORS","We evaluated 3T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for white matter injury in 76 adult mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients at the semiacute stage (11.2+/-3.3 days), employing both whole-brain voxel-wise and region-of-interest (ROI) approaches. The subgroup of 32 patients with any traumatic intracranial lesion on either day-of-injury computed tomography (CT) or semiacute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in numerous white matter tracts, compared to 50 control subjects. In contrast, 44 CT/MRI-negative mTBI patients demonstrated no significant difference in any DTI parameter, compared to controls. To determine the clinical relevance of DTI, we evaluated correlations between 3- and 6-month outcome and imaging, demographic/socioeconomic, and clinical predictors. Statistically significant univariable predictors of 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) included MRI evidence for contusion (odds ratio [OR] 4.9 per unit decrease in GOS-E; p=0.01), >=1 ROI with severely reduced FA (OR, 3.9; p=0.005), neuropsychiatric history (OR, 3.3; p=0.02), age (OR, 1.07/year; p=0.002), and years of education (OR, 0.79/year; p=0.01). Significant predictors of 6-month GOS-E included >=1 ROI with severely reduced FA (OR, 2.7; p=0.048), neuropsychiatric history (OR, 3.7; p=0.01), and years of education (OR, 0.82/year; p=0.03). For the subset of 37 patients lacking neuropsychiatric and substance abuse history, MRI surpassed all other predictors for both 3- and 6-month outcome prediction. This is the first study to compare DTI in individual mTBI patients to conventional imaging, clinical, and demographic/socioeconomic characteristics for outcome prediction.

Relationship of preinjury depressive symptoms to outcomes 3 mos after complicated and uncomplicated mild traumatic brain injury.,"Kumar, Raj G; Bracken, Michael B; Clark, Allison N; Nick, Todd G; Melguizo, Maria S; Sander, Angelle M","OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of preinjury depressive symptoms on outcomes 3 mos after complicated and uncomplicated cases of mild traumatic brain injury., DESIGN: Preinjury depressive symptoms, experienced in the 30 days before injury, as measured by retrospective self-report, were assessed within the first 2 wks after injury. The outcome measures assessed at 3 mos after injury included affective/behavioral, cognitive, and physical problems and health-related quality-of-life., RESULTS: There were 177 patients who completed both the baseline and 3-mo follow-up interviews. The sample was categorized by severity of depressive symptoms in the month before injury as normal, mild, or moderate-severe. Compared with those reporting no preinjury depressive symptoms, persons reporting moderate-severe depressive symptoms had significantly worse outcomes on the Affective and Behavioral and the Cognitive subscales of the Head Injury-Family Interview Problem Checklist and on the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary score. The group reporting mild preinjury depressive symptoms scored worse on a measure of cognitive symptoms compared with those with no preinjury depressive symptoms. There was no interaction between preinjury depressive symptoms and severity of the mild traumatic brain injury (complicated or uncomplicated) for any of the outcomes., CONCLUSION: Moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the month before injury seems to be a possible risk factor for poor affective/behavioral, cognitive, and mental health-related quality-of-life outcomes at 3 mos after mild traumatic brain injury.

Long-term outcome in elderly patients after operation for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.,"Cipolle, Mark D; Geffe, Kevin; Getchell, John; Reed, James F 3rd; Fulda, Gerard; Sugarman, Michael; Tinkoff, Glen H","OBJECTIVE: This study examined outcomes in elderly TBI patients who underwent a cranial operation., METHODS: We identified TBI patients > or = 65 who underwent a cranial operation from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008. Data collected included: age, admission GCS, mechanism of injury, ISS, Head AIS, type of operation, hemorrhage acuity, time to operation, pre-hospital warfarin or clopidogrel, and in-hospital death. Survivors were contacted by phone to determine an Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE). A favorable outcome was defined as having a GOSE of > or = 5 at follow-up, an unfavorable outcome was defined as: in-hospital death, death within one year of injury, and a GOSE < 5 at follow-up. Chi-square and student's t-test were used., RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four elderly TBI patients underwent cranial surgery. Mean age was 79.2 +/- 7.6 years. Most patients: had a ground level fall (86.0%), suffered a subdural hematoma (95.1%), and underwent craniotomy (89.0%). Twenty-eight percent died in the hospital and another 20.1% died within one year. Fifty-six patients were eligible for a GOSE interview of these: 17 were lost to follow-up, seven refused the GOSE interview, 22 had a GOSE > or = 5, and ten had a GOSE < 5. Mean follow-up was 42.6 +/- 14.9 months.

A systematic review of age and gender factors in prolonged post-concussion symptoms after mild head injury.,"King, Nigel S","BACKGROUND: Older age and female gender are known factors in the development of persisting post-concussion symptoms (PCS) after mild head injury (MHI), i.e. at 3+ months. Very few studies have examined longer-term symptoms. A recent review, however, established the importance of these variables in permanent PCS (18+ months). The current study repeats the review for prolonged symptoms (12-18 months)., METHODS: Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify all studies with data on (i) correlations between age/gender and prolonged outcome and (ii) mean ages/gender mixes of (a) prolonged samples selected for poor symptomatic outcome, (b) prolonged samples not selected for poor outcome and (c) epidemiological studies of MHI patients presenting to hospital., RESULTS: Correlation studies showed poorer outcome to be associated with both older age (2/5 studies) and female gender (5/6 studies). Those with poor prolonged outcome had a significantly higher mean age (35.9) than MHI patients in general (29.9). The proportion of men in these samples (48.6%) was significantly lower than MHI patients in general (66.7%)., CONCLUSIONS: Older age and female gender are vulnerability factors in the development of prolonged PCS.

The multiple linear regression model and Cox proportional hazards model were used for multivariate assessment of outcome predictors., RESULTS: The prevalence rate of surgical treatment for patients with TBI gradually but significantly (p < 0.001) increased by 47.6% from 5.0 per 100,000 persons in 1998 to 7.4 per 100,000 persons in 2010. Age, sex, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index score, hospital volume, and surgeon volume were significantly associated with TBI surgery outcomes (p < 0.05). Over the 12-year period analyzed, the estimated mean hospital treatment cost increased 19.06%, whereas the in-hospital mortality rate decreased 10.9%. The estimated mean time of overall survival after TBI surgery (+/- SD) was 83.0 +/- 4.2 months, and the overall in-hospital and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 74.5%, 67.3%, 61.1%, and 57.8%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal an increased prevalence of TBI, especially in older patients, and an increased hospital treatment cost but a decreased in-hospital mortality rate. Health care providers and patients should recognize that attributes of the patient and of the hospital may affect hospital resource utilization and the mortality rate.

Effect of demographic and injury etiologic factors on intensive care unit mortality after severe head injury in a low middle income country.,"Jaja, Blessing N R; Eghwrudjakpor, Patrick O","BACKGROUND: Low- and middle-income countries bear the mortality burden of head injury compared with high-income countries. Not much has been studied about predictors of poor outcome after head injury in these countries. This study describes and quantifies the effect of demographics and injury causative factors on mortality in a cohort managed in a Nigerian tertiary hospital intensive care., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of all patients admitted into intensive care with severe head injury at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria between 1 st January, 1997 and 31 st December, 2006. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the effect of age, gender and injury etiology on risk of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality., RESULTS: The number of ICU admission for severe head injury was 231 patients with a male to female ratio of 2.8:1. Patients' mean age and standard deviation was 31.2 +/- 15.5 years. The mortality rate was 52.8%. Road traffic injury was the most common etiologic factor (84%). Logistic regression analysis indicated a 56% increase in the risk of ICU mortality between the ages of 21 and 40 years. The effect of age was found to be nonlinear (likelihood ratio P = 0.033). On multivariable analysis, patient's gender (odds ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-1.97) and etiology of injury were not significantly associated with risk of mortality. Gender was not a modifier of the effect of age (P = 0.218)., CONCLUSION: The study indicated a strong prognostic effect of age.

CSF and plasma amyloid-beta temporal profiles and relationships with neurological status and mortality after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Mondello, Stefania; Buki, Andras; Barzo, Pal; Randall, Jeff; Provuncher, Gail; Hanlon, David; Wilson, David; Kobeissy, Firas; Jeromin, Andreas","The role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuropathology and its significant changes in biofluids after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still debated. We used ultrasensitive digital ELISA approach to assess amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) concentrations and time-course in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in plasma of patients with severe TBI and investigated their relationship to injury characteristics, neurological status and clinical outcome. We found decreased CSF Abeta42 levels in TBI patients acutely after injury with lower levels in patients who died 6 months post-injury than in survivors. Conversely, plasma Abeta42 levels were significantly increased in TBI with lower levels in patients who survived. A trend analysis showed that both CSF and plasma Abeta42 levels strongly correlated with mortality. A positive correlation between changes in CSF Abeta42 concentrations and neurological status as assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was identified.

Diagnostic and prognostic significance of suPAR in traumatic brain injury.,"Yu, Li; Wu, Xiaoling; Wang, Hui; Long, Ding; Yang, Junhui; Zhang, Yuanchao","BACKGROUND: Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a highly sensitive marker that reflects increased inflammation and is positively correlated with pro-inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this prospective observational study was to explore the relationship between the plasma concentration of suPAR and traumatic brain injury (TBI)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all 112 patients with TBI were included. Patients coming within 12 h whose highest abbreviated injury score (AIS) was 3 or less (other than head injury) were considered to be isolated TBI. Blood samples were obtained on admission. In all ninety healthy volunteers were enrolled as control group. Levels of plasma suPAR were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma D-dimer was measured and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was assessed at the same time., RESULTS: Plasma suPAR values were statistically significantly higher in TBI patients than in controls (patients; 14.89 +/- 6.94, controls; 2.79 +/- 0.69, P < 0.01). The suPAR levels were strongly associated with the severity of TBI patients. The suPAR levels increased in association with the severity of brain injury, significance being found among all three groups: severe, moderate and mild TBI. The suPAR levels in non-survivals were significantly increased compared to the survivals (P < 0.05). Plasma levels of suPAR were strongly correlated to the GCS score (r = -0.854) and the levels of D-dimer (r = 0.753, both P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of suPAR levels indicated that suPAR values had a high diagnostic specificity and sensitivity to differentiate survivals from non-survivals, the area underneath the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.801 (95% CI: 0.698-0.903). The optimal suPAR cut-off value in predicting mortality was 15.70 ng/ml (sensitivity: 70.4%; specificity: 65.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of suPAR are elevated in TBI patients.

We aimed to externally validate recently developed models for prediction of six month unfavourable outcome and six month mortality., METHODS: The International Neurotrauma Research Organization - Prehospital dataset (INRO-PH) was collected within an observational study between 2009-2012 in Austria and includes 778 patients with TBI of GCS < = 12. Three sets of prognostic models were externally validated: the IMPACT core and extended models, CRASH basic models and the Nijmegen models developed by Jacobs et al - all for prediction of six month unfavourable outcome and six month mortality. The external validity of the models was assessed by discrimination (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) and calibration (calibration statistics and plots)., RESULTS: Median age in the validation cohort was 50 years and 44% had an admission GSC motor score of 1-3. Six-month mortality was 27%. Mortality could better be predicted (AUCs around 0.85) than unfavourable outcome (AUCs around 0.80). Calibration plots showed that the observed outcomes were systematically better than was predicted for all models considered. The best performance was noted for the original Nijmegen model, but refitting led to similar performance for the IMPACT Extended, CRASH Basic, and Nijmegen models., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, all the prognostic models we validated in this study possess good discriminative ability for prediction of six month outcome in patients with moderate or severe TBI but outcomes were systemically better than predicted.

Predictors of deterioration indicating a requirement for surgery in mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.,"Suehiro, Eiichi; Koizumi, Hiroyasu; Fujiyama, Yuichi; Yoneda, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Michiyasu","OBJECTIVES: Careful course observation is necessary for cases of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury even when disturbed consciousness is mild on admission. This is because delayed enlargement of hematoma and progression of cerebral swelling may occur and result in an emergency craniotomy. Here, we investigated coagulopathy and abnormal fibrinolysis as a predictive factor of ""deterioration requiring surgery"" in mild to moderate traumatic brain injury., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with mild to moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9-15) traumatic brain injury were admitted between June 2009 and October 2010. There were 54 subjects in the study, excluding those treated with oral antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. Patients were classified into those with deterioration requiring surgery [op(+)] or those without deterioration requiring surgery [op(-)]. This was based on whether surgical treatment was performed for hematoma expansion, and exacerbated consciousness level within 3 days after admission. Age, GCS score on admission and blood test findings (platelet count, PT-INR, APTT, fibrinogen, FDP, and d-dimer) on admission were compared., RESULTS: The op(+) and op(-) groups comprised 7 (13.0%) and 47 patients (87.0%), respectively. Platelet counts (24.8 vs 18.5 x 10(4)/mul) were decreased, and PT-INR (1.0 vs 1.2) was higher in the op(+) group. Specially, APTT (28.6 vs 39.1s), FDP (28.9 vs 112.9 mug/ml), and D-dimer (17.3 vs 69.6 mug/ml) values were significantly higher in the op(+) group., CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and abnormal fibrinolysis, which are measurable in routine medical practice, is associated with deterioration requiring surgery in mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, indicating that careful course observation is necessary.

Long-term outcome prediction after a traumatic brain injury using early somatosensory and acoustic evoked potentials: analysis of the predictive value of the different single components of the potentials.,"Morgalla, M H; Tatagiba, M","PURPOSE: The prediction of the long-term outcome of comatose patients after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) using early somatosensory and acoustic evoked potentials is controversial. It was our aim to examine the different single components of the evoked potentials regarding their predictive capacity in comatose patients., METHODS: We examined the amplitude and latency of the wave N20, the amplitude differences between right and left hemisphere, the central conduction time (CCT), the amplitude ratio N20 left/N20 right, the amplitude and latency of peak V, the inter-peak latency I-V and the amplitude ratio V/I. The long-term clinical outcome of the patients was re-evaluated 3 years after their discharge and correlated with the different components., RESULTS: Only the central conduction time (CCT) and the latency of the wave N20 indicated a statistical correlation with the later outcome (p = 0.0366). The amplitude ratio of wave V/I of the EAEP did not reveal a significant statistical difference between the various outcome groups., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of single components of the SSEP and EAEP per se could not predict the long-term clinical outcome after TBI.

The association between admission systolic blood pressure and mortality in significant traumatic brain injury: a multi-centre cohort study.,"Fuller, Gordon; Hasler, Rebecca M; Mealing, Nicole; Lawrence, Thomas; Woodford, Maralyn; Juni, Peter; Lecky, Fiona","INTRODUCTION: Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) is an important secondary insult following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its exact relationship with outcome is not well characterised. Although a SBP of <90 mmHg represents the threshold for hypotension in consensus TBI treatment guidelines, recent studies suggest redefining hypotension at higher levels. This study therefore aimed to fully characterise the association between admission SBP and mortality to further inform resuscitation endpoints., METHODS: We conducted a multicentre cohort study using data from the largest European trauma registry. Consecutive adult patients with AIS head scores >2 admitted directly to specialist neuroscience centres between 2005 and July 2012 were studied. Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine the association between admission SBP and 30 day inpatient mortality. Models were adjusted for confounders including age, severity of injury, and to account for differential quality of hospital care., RESULTS: 5057 patients were included in complete case analyses. Admission SBP demonstrated a smooth u-shaped association with outcome in a bivariate analysis, with increasing mortality at both lower and higher values, and no evidence of any threshold effect. Adjusting for confounding slightly attenuated the association between mortality and SBP at levels <120 mmHg, and abolished the relationship for higher SBP values. Case-mix adjusted odds of death were 1.5 times greater at <120 mmHg, doubled at <100 mmHg, tripled at <90 mmHg, and six times greater at SBP<70 mmHg, p<0.01., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that TBI studies should model SBP as a continuous variable and may suggest that current TBI treatment guidelines, using a cut-off for hypotension at SBP<90 mmHg, should be reconsidered.

Patient-specific thresholds of intracranial pressure in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Lazaridis, Christos; DeSantis, Stacia M; Smielewski, Peter; Menon, David K; Hutchinson, Peter; Pickard, John D; Czosnyka, Marek","OBJECT: Based on continuous monitoring of the pressure reactivity index (PRx), the authors defined individualized intracranial pressure (ICP) thresholds by graphing the relationship between ICP and PRx. These investigators hypothesized that an ""ICP dose"" based on individually assessed ICP thresholds would correlate more closely with the 6-month outcome when compared with ICP doses derived by the recommended universal thresholds of 20 and 25 mm Hg., METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 327 patients with severe traumatic brain injury., RESULTS: Individualized thresholds were visually identified from graphs of PRx versus ICP; PRx > 0.2 was the cutoff. Intracranial pressure doses were then computed as the cumulative area under the curve above the defined thresholds in graphing ICP versus time. The term ""Dose 20"" (D20) was used to refer to an ICP threshold of 20 mm Hg; the markers D25 and DPRx were calculated similarly. Separate logistic regression models were fit with death as the outcome and each dose as the predictor, both alone and adjusted for covariates. The discriminative ability of each dose for mortality was assessed by receiver operating characteristic AUC analysis in which 5-fold cross-validation was used. A clearly identifiable PRx-based threshold was possible in 224 patients (68%). The DPRx (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.87) was found to have the highest area under the curve (AUC) over both D20 (0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.81) and D25 (0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.83); in the cross-validation model, DPRx remained the best discriminator of mortality (DPRx: AUC 0.77 [95% CI 0.68-0.89]; D20: 0.72 [95% CI 0.66-0.81]; and D25: 0.65 [95% CI 0.56-0.73])., CONCLUSIONS: The authors explored the importance of different ICP thresholds for outcome by calculating patient-specific ICP doses based on the continuous monitoring of cerebrovascular pressure reactivity. They found that these individualized doses of intracranial hypertension were stronger predictors of death than doses derived from the universal thresholds of 20 and 25 mm Hg.

The current study was designed to investigate the change of plasma TSP-1 levels and assess the prognostic predictive effect of plasma TSP-1 level and it is associated with head trauma severity in the patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plasma TSP-1 levels of 134 patients and 134 healthy controls were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationships between plasma TSP-1 levels and trauma severity reflected by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores as well as between plasma TSP-1 levels and short-term and long-term clinical outcomes were analyzed using multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Plasma TSP-1 levels were statistically significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. The multivariate analysis demonstrated close association of TSP-1 with GCS scores and also identified TSP-1 as an independent predictor for 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality, and 6-month unfavorable outcome.

Timing of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in severe traumatic brain injury: Impact on overall mortality.,"McCredie, Victoria A; Alali, Aziz S; Xiong, Wei; Rubenfeld, Gordon D; Cuthbertson, Brian H; Scales, Damon C; Nathens, Avery B","BACKGROUND: The care of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex and confounded by uncertainty in prognoses. Studies have demonstrated significant unexplained variation in mortality between centers. Possible explanations include differences in the quality and intensity of care across centers, including the appropriateness and timing of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. We postulated that centers with a preponderance of early deaths might have a more pessimistic approach to the TBI patient, which would be reflected in an increased hospital TBI-related mortality., METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Time to death was used as a proxy for time to withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Centers were classified as early or late based on when the majority (75th percentile) of their TBI-related deaths occurred. We evaluated the association between adjusted mortality and center classification using a hierarchical multivariable model. Two hundred trauma centers contributing data to the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program from 2010 through 2013 were involved. The cohort included 17,505 patients with severe isolated TBI., RESULTS: One hundred eight centers were classified as early centers. The 75th percentile for time to death was 4 days among early centers versus 7 days in late centers. Mortality was 34% and 33%, respectively. After adjustment for case mix, care in an early center was not associated with increased odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.09). Higher odds of death were independently associated with age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, multiple comorbidities, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral mass lesions, brainstem lesions, and signs of compressed or absent basal cisterns., CONCLUSION: Centers rendering early decisions related to withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in TBI patients, as measured by time until death, do not have worse outcomes than those making later decisions.

External Validation of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury: Prognostic Models for Traumatic Brain Injury on the Study of the Neuroprotective Activity of Progesterone in Severe Traumatic Brain I,"Sun, Hong; Lingsma, Hester F; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Maas, Andrew I R","Prediction models for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important for multiple reasons, including case-mix adjustment, trial design, and benchmarking for quality-of-care evaluation. Models should be generalizable and therefore require regular external validation. We aimed to validate the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic models for moderate and severe TBI in a recent randomized controlled trial. We studied 1124 patients enrolled in the multi-center randomized placebo-controlled Study of the Neuroprotective Activity of Progesterone in Severe Traumatic Brain Injuries (SyNAPSe) trial that evaluated the efficacy of progesterone in TBI. Treatment and placebo groups were combined for analysis. We evaluated the predictive performance of the three prognostic models (core, extended, and lab) from the IMPACT study with regard to discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration (comparison of observed to predicted risks). Substantial differences were found in case-mix and outcome distribution between IMPACT and SyNAPSe. In line with the more homogeneous case-mix of a clinical trial, the discriminative performance was reasonable. For the core model, an AUC of 0.677 and 0.684 was obtained for 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome, respectively. Performance was slightly better for the extended model (0.693 and 0.705) and for the lab model (0.689 and 0.711, respectively). For calibration, we found overestimation of mortality, especially at higher risk predictions, and underestimation of unfavorable outcome, especially at lower risk predictions. This pattern of miscalibration was consistent across all three models. In a contemporary trial setting, the IMPACT models have reasonable discrimination if enrollment restrictions apply. Observed changes in outcome distribution necessitate updating of previously developed prognostic models.",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,16,1535-43,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4164,26652051,#6875,Sun 2016,,yes
Change of serum levels of thioredoxin in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Pan, De-Sheng; Le, Hai-Wei; Yan, Min; Hassan, Muhammad; Gong, Jiang-Biao; Wang, Hao","BACKGROUND: Thioredoxin (TRX), a potent anti-oxidant, is released during inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between serum TRX concentrations and trauma severity and outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (STBI)., METHODS: We determined serum TRX concentrations in 112 patients and 112 controls. Multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the predictive factors of 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome. The predictive values were investigated under receiver operating characteristic curves., RESULTS: Serum TRX concentrations were markedly higher in patients than in controls (19.1+/-7.8ng/ml vs. 8.0+/-2.3ng/ml, P<0.001). There was a significant negative association between serum TRX concentrations and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores (r=-0.543, P<0.001). Increased TRX was identified as an independent prognostic marker of 1-week mortality [Odds ratio (OR), 1.220; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.101-1.367; P<0.001], 6-month mortality (OR, 1.201; 95% CI, 1.097-1.324; P<0.001) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (OR, 1.189; 95% CI, 1.090-1.311; P<0.001). TRX concentrations improved area under curve of GCS scores for 6-month unfavorable outcome, but not for 1-week mortality and 6-month mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum TRX concentration, associated highly with trauma severity and poor outcome, might be a novel prognostic marker in patients with STBI.

Although TBI is amongst the most common causes of olfactory dysfunction the relationship between injury severity and olfactory problems has not yet been investigated with validated and standardized methods in the first days following the TBI., METHODS: We measured olfactory function in 63 patients admitted with TBI within the first 12 days following the trauma by means of the Sniffin' Sticks identification test (quantitative assessment) and a parosmia questionnaire (qualitative assessment). TBI severity was determined by means of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and by duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) as measured by the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test., RESULTS: Poor olfactory scores correlated with a longer amnesia period, but not with GCS scores. Further, we observed higher parosmia scores in assault victims than in victims of falls or motor vehicle collisions., CONCLUSIONS: We show that PTA is intimately related to olfactory problems following a TBI. Thus, a thorough evaluation of olfaction is essential in order to detect posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction and to take appropriate actions early on to help the individual deal with this impairment.

The effect of brain injury on the inflammatory response following severe trauma.,"Lustenberger, T; Kern, M; Relja, B; Wutzler, S; Stormann, P; Marzi, I","INTRODUCTION: The inflammatory response is an important part of the pathophysiology of severe injury and, in particular, of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study evaluates the inflammatory course following major trauma and focuses on the effect of severe TBI on inflammatory markers., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 123 severely injured (ISS >=16) trauma patients. The study cohort was divided into patients with isolated TBI (Head AIS >=3, all other AIS <3), polytraumatized patients with severe TBI (Head AIS >=3; AIS of other body area >=3; Polytrauma+TBI) and polytraumatized patients without TBI (Head AIS <3; Polytrauma). Levels of inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6 [IL-6], C-reactive Protein [CRP], leukocytes) measured upon arrival and through hospital days 1-3 were compared between the groups., RESULTS: On admission and through hospital day 3, IL-6 levels were significantly different between the 3 groups (admission: isolated TBI vs. Polytrauma+TBI vs. Polytrauma; 94+/-16 vs. 149+/-20 vs. 245+/-50pg/mL; p<0.05). Interleukin-6 levels peaked on hospital day 1 and declined thereafter. C-reactive protein and leukocyte counts were not significantly different between the cohorts on arrival and peaked on hospital day 2 and 1, respectively. In patients with severe TBI, admission IL-6 levels significantly predicted the development of septic complications (ROC analysis, AUC: 0.88, p=0.001, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97) and multiple organ dysfunction (ROC analysis, AUC: 0.83, p=0.001, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96)., CONCLUSION: Severe TBI reduced the inflammatory response following trauma. Significant correlations between admission IL-6 values and the development of MOF, sepsis and the neurological outcome were found in patients with TBI. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

The Rotterdam Scoring System Can Be Used as an Independent Factor for Predicting Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes.,"Talari, Hamid Reza; Fakharian, Esmaeil; Mousavi, Nooshin; Abedzadeh-Kalahroudi, Masoumeh; Akbari, Hossein; Zoghi, Sommayeh","OBJECTIVE: Predicting outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury is critically important for making sound clinical decisions. This study aimed at determining the prognostic value of the Rotterdam scoring system to predict early death among these patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed prospectively on 150 patients with traumatic brain injury hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, mechanism of trauma, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and accompanying lesions were documented. A brain computed tomography was performed for each patient and scored by use of the Rotterdam system. Patients were monitored for 2 weeks after hospital discharge, and their outcomes were documented. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis and prognostic values of Rotterdam system were conducted by SPSS software., RESULTS: Nineteen patients (12.7%) died during the course of the study. The mean age of the dead patients was significantly greater than those who survived (P = 0.037). The sensitivity and the specificity of the Rotterdam scoring system at the cutoff score of 4 were 84.2% and 96.2%, respectively. Rotterdam score was significantly correlated with patient outcomes (P < 0.0001). Moreover, logistic regression analyses revealed that factors such as age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Rotterdam score significantly contributed to patient outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Rotterdam score is an independent factor for predicting outcomes among patients with traumatic brain injury. At the cutoff score of 4, the Rotterdam system can predict outcomes among patients suffering from traumatic brain injury with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Can Serum Glucose Level in Early Admission Predict Outcome in Patients with Severe Head Trauma?.,"Salehpour, Firooz; Bazzazi, Amir Mohammad; Aghazadeh, Javad; Abbasivash, Rahman; Forouhideh, Yalda; Mirzaei, Farhad; Naseri Alavi, Seyed Ahmad","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is a major general health concern. This study aims to evaluate a possible relationship between the serum level of glucose during admission and the outcome of patients with severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: In this prospective study, 80 patients with severe traumatic brain injury were recruited from the emergency department of Urmia Imam Khomeini Hospital. Serum level of glucose was measured at the time of admission and its correlation was investigated with the Glasgow Coma Scale score (on admission, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week later, and at discharge) and Glasgow Outcome Score. In addition, the value of admission serum glucose was compared between deceased and discharged patients., RESULTS: Eighty patients with severe head trauma, 71 men (88%) and 9 women (11.2%) with a mean age of 31.71 +/- 15.66 years, were enrolled into the study. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25% (n = 20). There was no significant correlation between serum glucose level and Glasgow Coma Scale score (at different intervals) or Glasgow Outcome Score. The mean serum level of glucose was comparable between deceased and discharged patients (186.10 +/- 51.36 vs. 187.98 +/- 76.03 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum glucose is not a significant indicator of outcome in patients with severe head trauma.

Principal components derived from CSF inflammatory profiles predict outcome in survivors after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Kumar, Raj G; Rubin, Jonathan E; Berger, Rachel P; Kochanek, Patrick M; Wagner, Amy K","Studies have characterized absolute levels of multiple inflammatory markers as significant risk factors for poor outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, inflammatory marker concentrations are highly inter-related, and production of one may result in the production or regulation of another. Therefore, a more comprehensive characterization of the inflammatory response post-TBI should consider relative levels of markers in the inflammatory pathway. We used principal component analysis (PCA) as a dimension-reduction technique to characterize the sets of markers that contribute independently to variability in cerebrospinal (CSF) inflammatory profiles after TBI. Using PCA results, we defined groups (or clusters) of individuals (n=111) with similar patterns of acute CSF inflammation that were then evaluated in the context of outcome and other relevant CSF and serum biomarkers collected days 0-3 and 4-5 post-injury. We identified four significant principal components (PC1-PC4) for CSF inflammation from days 0-3, and PC1 accounted for the greatest (31%) percentage of variance. PC1 was characterized by relatively higher CSF sICAM-1, sFAS, IL-10, IL-6, sVCAM-1, IL-5, and IL-8 levels. Cluster analysis then defined two distinct clusters, such that individuals in cluster 1 had highly positive PC1 scores and relatively higher levels of CSF cortisol, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and S100b; this group also had higher serum cortisol and lower serum BDNF. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that individuals in cluster 1 had a 10.9 times increased likelihood of GOS scores of 2/3 vs. 4/5 at 6 months compared to cluster 2, after controlling for covariates. Cluster group did not discriminate between mortality compared to GOS scores of 4/5 after controlling for age and other covariates. Cluster groupings also did not discriminate mortality or 12 month outcomes in multivariate models. PCA and cluster analysis establish that a subset of CSF inflammatory markers measured in days 0-3 post-TBI may distinguish individuals with poor 6-month outcome, and future studies should prospectively validate these findings. PCA of inflammatory mediators after TBI could aid in prognostication and in identifying patient subgroups for therapeutic interventions. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Predictors of Outcomes in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Baum, Justin; Entezami, Pouya; Shah, Kavit; Medhkour, Azedine","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate patients treated for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) to determine how multiple organ trauma (MOT) and lung injuries sustained at the time of initial injury affect outcome., METHODS: A single institution retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with TBI at a level I trauma center from 2000 to 2014 was conducted. Clinical outcome was based on Glasgow Outcome Scale at hospital discharge. Lung injury was defined as the presence of pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib fractures, or diaphragmatic rupture proven by x-ray or computed tomography scan. MOT was defined as trauma to one body region with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score >=3 plus trauma to 2 additional body regions with AIS scores >=1. Regression analysis was conducted with SPSS 21., RESULTS: There were 409 patients reviewed. The majority of patients were male (73%), average age was 46 years (range, 16-94 years), average Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7, and 71% had a severe TBI (GCS <=8). Thirty percent of patients had poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale = 1-2) Regression analysis indicated age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, P < 0.001), initial GCS (OR 0.88, P < 0.001), Injury Severity Score (OR 1.03, P = 0.021), and head AIS >=5 (OR 0.55, P = 0.019) were significant independent predictors of poor outcome. Sex, MOT, lung injury, and lung injury severity were not significant predictors of outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Age, GCS, Injury Severity Score, and critical head injuries (AIS >=5) were significant tools in predicting outcome in this patient cohort. MOT and traumatic lung injury may cause significant damage to a patient suffering from a severe TBI, but these injuries do not predict mortality in this patient population.

Serum biomarkers as predictors of long-term outcome in severe traumatic brain injury: analysis from a randomized placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial.,"Raheja, Amol; Sinha, Sumit; Samson, Neha; Bhoi, Sanjeev; Subramanian, Arulselvi; Sharma, Pushpa; Sharma, Bhawani Shankar","OBJECTIVE There has been increased interest in the potential importance of biochemical parameters as predictors of outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). METHODS Of 107 patients with sTBI (age 18-65 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4-8 presenting within 8 hours after injury) who were randomized for a placebo-controlled Phase II trial of progesterone with or without hypothermia, the authors serially analyzed serum biomarkers (S100-B, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], neuron-specific enolase [NSE], tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 [IL-6], estrogen [Eg], and progesterone [Pg]). This analysis was performed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique at admission and 7 days later for 86 patients, irrespective of assigned group. The long-term predictive values of serum biomarkers for dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, functional independence measure, and survival status at 6 and 12 months were analyzed using an adjusted binary logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS A favorable GOS score (4-5) at 1 year was predicted by higher admission IL-6 (above 108.36 pg/ml; area under the curve [AUC] 0.69, sensitivity 52%, and specificity 78.6%) and Day 7 Pg levels (above 3.15 ng/ml; AUC 0.79, sensitivity 70%, and specificity 92.9%). An unfavorable GOS score (1-3) at 1 year was predicted by higher Day 7 GFAP levels (above 9.50 ng/ml; AUC 0.82, sensitivity 78.6%, and specificity 82.4%). Survivors at 1 year had significantly higher Day 7 Pg levels (above 3.15 ng/ml; AUC 0.78, sensitivity 66.7%, and specificity 90.9%). Nonsurvivors at 1 year had significantly higher Day 7 GFAP serum levels (above 11.14 ng/ml; AUC 0.81, sensitivity 81.8%, and specificity 88.9%) and Day 7 IL-6 serum levels (above 71.26 pg/ml; AUC 0.87, sensitivity 81.8%, and specificity 87%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of outcome at 1 year were serum levels of Day 7 Pg (favorable GOS-OR 3.24, CI 1.5-7, p = 0.003; and favorable survival-OR 2, CI 1.2-3.5, p = 0.01); admission IL-6 (favorable GOS-OR 1.04, CI 1.00-1.08, p = 0.04); and Day 7 GFAP (unfavorable GOS-OR 0.79, CI 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01; and unfavorable survival-OR 0.80, CI 0.66-0.96, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Serial Pg, GFAP, and IL-6 monitoring could aid in prognosticating outcomes in patients with acute sTBI. A cause and effect relationship or a mere association of these biomarkers to outcome needs to be further studied for better understanding of the pathophysiology of sTBI and for choosing potential therapeutic targets.

Diffusion tensor imaging in acute-to-subacute traumatic brain injury: a longitudinal analysis.,"Edlow, Brian L; Copen, William A; Izzy, Saef; Bakhadirov, Khamid; van der Kouwe, Andre; Glenn, Mel B; Greenberg, Steven M; Greer, David M; Wu, Ona","BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may have prognostic utility in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the optimal timing of DTI data acquisition is unknown because of dynamic changes in white matter water diffusion during the acute and subacute stages of TBI. We aimed to characterize the direction and magnitude of early longitudinal changes in white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and to determine whether acute or subacute FA values correlate more reliably with functional outcomes after TBI., METHODS: From a prospective TBI outcomes database, 11 patients who underwent acute (<=7 days) and subacute (8 days to rehabilitation discharge) DTI were retrospectively analyzed. Longitudinal changes in FA were measured in 11 white matter regions susceptible to traumatic axonal injury. Correlations were assessed between acute FA, subacute FA and the disability rating scale (DRS) score, which was ascertained at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation., RESULTS: FA declined from the acute-to-subacute period in the genu of the corpus callosum (0.70 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.11, p < 0.05) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (0.54+/-0.07 vs. 0.49+/-0.07, p < 0.01). Acute correlations between FA and DRS score were variable: higher FA in the body (R = -0.78, p = 0.02) and splenium (R = -0.83, p = 0.003) of the corpus callosum was associated with better outcomes (i.e. lower DRS scores), whereas higher FA in the genu of the corpus callosum (R = 0.83, p = 0.02) corresponded with worse outcomes (i.e. higher DRS scores). In contrast, in the subacute period higher FA in the splenium correlated with better outcomes (R = -0.63, p < 0.05) and no inverse correlations were observed., CONCLUSIONS: White matter FA declined during the acute-to-subacute stages of TBI.

Risk ratios of complications, odds ratios of mortality and geometric mean ratios of length of stay (LOS) were calculated using generalized linear models with adjustment for prognostic indicators and hospital cluster effects., RESULTS: Of 12,887 patients, 3.2% had at least one neurological complication and 22.6% a non-neurological complication. Mechanical ventilation, head injury severity, blood transfusion and neurosurgical intervention had the strongest correlation with neurological complications. Mechanical ventilation, the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood transfusion and concomitant injuries had the strongest correlation with non-neurological complications. Neurological and non-neurological complications were associated with a 85% and 53% increase in the odds of mortality, and a 60% and two-fold increases in LOS, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: More than 20% of patients with TBI developed a complication. Many of these complications were associated with increased mortality and LOS.

We therefore applied a set-theoretic logical analysis to the Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury (CRASH) trial database. Complete data analysis of 6945 patients demonstrated 9 different configurations of admission variables were sufficient for favorable outcome in 87.5% of all cases and explained 57% of favorable outcomes (moderate disability or good outcome). We also evaluated the contrasting configurations for unfavorable versus favorable outcome. Results are largely in line with findings of previous studies however the influence of age fell behind GCS components, which is unexpected.

Early Asymmetric Cardio-Cerebral Causality and Outcome after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Gao, Lei; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek; Ercole, Ari","The brain and heart are two vital systems in health and disease, increasingly recognized as a complex, interdependent network with constant information flow in both directions. After severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), the causal, directed interactions between the brain, heart, and autonomic nervous system have not been well established. Novel methods are needed to probe unmeasured, potentially prognostic information in complex biological networks that are not revealed by traditional means. In this study, we examined potential bidirectional causality between intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) and its relationship to mortality in a 24-h period early post-TBI. We applied Granger causality (GC) analysis to cardio-cerebral monitoring data from 171 severe TBI patients admitted to a single neurocritical care center over a 10-year period. There was significant bidirectional causality between ICP and MAP, MAP and HR, and ICP and HR in the majority of patients (p < 0.01). MAP influenced both ICP and HR to a greater extent (higher GC, p < 0. 00001), but there was no dominant unidirectional causality between ICP and HR (p = 0.85). Those who died had significantly lower GC for ICP causing MAP and HR causing ICP (p = 0.006 and p = 0.004, respectively) and were predictors of mortality independent of age, sex, and traditional intracranial variables (ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, GCS, and pressure reactivity index). Examining the brain and heart with GC-based features for the first time in severe TBI patients has confirmed strong interdependence and reveals a significant relationship between select causality pairs and mortality. These results support the notion that impaired causal information flow between the cerebrovascular, autonomic, and cardiovascular systems are of central importance in severe TBI.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,19,2743-2752,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2016.4787,28330412,#5973,Gao 2017,,yes
Monitoring of Optimal Cerebral Perfusion Pressure in Traumatic Brain Injured Patients Using a Multi-Window Weighting Algorithm.,"Liu, Xiuyun; Maurits, Natasha M; Aries, Marcel J H; Czosnyka, Marek; Ercole, Ari; Donnelly, Joseph; Cardim, Danilo; Kim, Dong-Joo; Dias, Celeste; Cabeleira, Manuel; Smielewski, Peter","Methods to identify an autoregulation guided ""optimal"" cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) for traumatic brain injury patients (TBI) have been reported through several studies. An important drawback of existing methodology is that CPPopt can be calculated only in ~50-60% of the monitoring time. In this study, we hypothesized that the CPPopt yield and the continuity can be improved significantly through application of a multi-window and weighting calculation algorithm, without adversely affecting preservation of its prognostic value. Data of 526 severe TBI patients admitted between 2003 and 2015 were studied. The multi-window CPPopt calculation was based on automated curve fitting in pressure reactivity index (PRx)-CPP plots using data from 36 increasing length time windows (2-8 h). The resulting matrix of CPPopts was then averaged in a weighted manner. The yield, continuity, and stability of CPPopt were studied. The difference between patients' actual CPP and CPPopt (DELTACPP) was calculated and the association with outcome was analyzed. Overall, the multi-window method demonstrated more continuous and stable presentation of CPPopt in this cohort. The new method resulted in a mean (+/-SE) CPPopt yield of 94% +/- 2.1%, as opposed to the previous single-window-based CPPopt yield of 51% +/- 0.94%. The stability of CPPopt across the whole monitoring period was significantly improved by using the new algorithm (p < 0.001). The relationship between DELTACPP according to the multi-window algorithm and outcome was similar to that for CPPopt calculated on the basis of a single window.

Machine Learning to Predict In-Hospital Morbidity and Mortality after Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Matsuo, Kazuya; Aihara, Hideo; Nakai, Tomoaki; Morishita, Akitsugu; Tohma, Yoshiki; Kohmura, Eiji","Recently, successful predictions using machine learning (ML) algorithms have been reported in various fields. However, in traumatic brain injury (TBI) cohorts, few studies have examined modern ML algorithms. To develop a simple ML model for TBI outcome prediction, we conducted a performance comparison of nine algorithms: ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees, decision tree, Gaussian naive Bayes, multi-nomial naive Bayes, and support vector machine. Fourteen feasible parameters were introduced in the ML models, including age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure (SBP), abnormal pupillary response, major extracranial injury, computed tomography (CT) findings, and routinely collected laboratory values (glucose, C-reactive protein [CRP], and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products [FDP]). Data from 232 patients with TBI were randomly divided into a training sample (80%) for hyperparameter tuning and validation sample (20%). The bootstrap method was used for validation. Random forest demonstrated the best performance for in-hospital poor outcome prediction and ridge regression for in-hospital mortality prediction: the mean statistical measures were 100% sensitivity, 72.3% specificity, 91.7% accuracy, and 0.895 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); and 88.4% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity, 88.6% accuracy, and 0.875 AUC, respectively. Based on the feature selection method using the tree-based ensemble algorithm, age, Glasgow Coma Scale, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and glucose were identified as the most important prognostic factors for poor outcome and mortality. Our results indicate the relatively good predictive performance of modern ML for TBI outcome. Further external validation is required for more heterogeneous samples to confirm our results.",2020,/,Journal of neurotrauma,37,1,202-210,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6276,31359814,#4935,Matsuo 2020,,yes

Four patient subgroups were constructed based on information documented at the time of injury: neither LOC nor AMS, LOC only, AMS only, and both. Logistic regression models assessed LOC and AMS as predictors of functional recovery at 1, 3, and 6 months., RESULTS: A gradient of risk of incomplete functional recovery at 1, 3, and 6 months postinjury was noted, moving from neither LOC nor AMS, to LOC or AMS alone, to both. LOC was associated with incomplete functional recovery at 1 and 3 months (odds ratio=2.17, SE=0.46, p<0.001; and odds ratio=1.80, SE=0.40, p=0.008, respectively). AMS was associated with incomplete functional recovery at 1 month only (odds ratio=1.77, SE=0.37 p=0.007). No association was found between AMS and functional recovery in patients with no LOC.

"Intracranial pressure variability: relation to clinical outcome, intracranial pressure-volume index, cerebrovascular reactivity and blood pressure variability.","Svedung Wettervik, Teodor; Howells, Timothy; Enblad, Per; Lewen, Anders","It was recently found in traumatic brain injury (TBI) that ICP variability (ICPV) predicted favorable outcome. We hypothesized that ICPV may depend on intracranial compliance, unstable blood pressure and cerebral vasomotion. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the explanatory variables for ICPV and its relation to outcome. Data from 362 TBI patients were retrospectively analyzed day 2 to 5 post-injury. ICPV was evaluated in three ways. First, variability in the sub-minute time interval (similar to B waves) was calculated as the amplitude of the ICP slow waves using a bandpass filter, limiting the analysis to oscillations of 55 to 15 s (ICP AMP 55-15). The second and third ICPV measures were calculated as the deviation from the mean ICP averaged over 30 min (ICPV-30m) and 4 h (ICPV-4h), respectively. All ICPV measures were associated with a reduced intracranial pressure/volume state (high ICP and RAP) and high blood pressure variability in multiple linear regression analyses. Higher ICPV was associated with better pressure reactivity in the univariate, but not the multiple analyses. All ICPV measures were associated with favorable outcome in univariate analysis, but only ICP AMP 55-15 and ICPV-30m did so in the multiple logistic regression analysis. Higher ICPV can be explained by a reduced intracranial compliance and variations in cerebral blood volume due to the vessel response to unstable blood pressure. As ICP AMP 55-15 and ICPV-30m independently predicted favorable outcome, it may represent general cerebral vessel activity, associated with better cerebral blood flow regulation and less secondary insults.",2020,/,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,34,4,733-741,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10877-019-00387-9,31538266,#4918,SvedungWettervik 2020,,yes

Clinical outcomes depend on cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) impairment. Here, we compare the effectiveness of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt)-targeted therapy in younger (<45 years of age) and elderly (>=45 years of age) TBI patients. Single-center multi-modal invasive arterial blood pressure(t), intracranial pressure (ICP)(t), cerebral perfusion pressure CPP(t), and CPPopt(t) monitoring (n = 81) was performed. ICM+ software was used for continuous CPPopt(t) status assessment by identification of pressure reactivity index (PRx).

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of serum biomarkers S100beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, total tau, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) with traumatic brain injury severity and the amount and location of hemorrhagic traumatic lesions., METHODS: A prospective observational cohort of 115 patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-15 were evaluated. Intracranial lesion volume was measured from the semiautomatic segmentation of hematoma on computed tomography using Analyze software. The establishment of possible biomarker cutoff points for intracranial lesion detection was estimated using the Youden Index (J) obtained from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve., RESULTS: SAA1, YKL-40, PCT, and S100beta showed the most robust association with level of consciousness, both with total GCS and motor score. Biomarkers significantly correlated with volumetric measurements of subdural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and total amount of bleeding. The type of intracranial hemorrhage was associated with various release patterns of neurobiochemical markers., CONCLUSIONS: YKL-40, SAA1, C-reactive protein, and PCT combined with S100beta were the most promising biomarkers to determine the presence, location, and extent of traumatic intracranial lesions.

Routine Blood Tests for Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Can They Predict Outcomes?.,"Dolmans, Rianne G F; Hulsbergen, Alexander F C; Gormley, William B; Broekman, Marike L D","OBJECTIVE: Outcome prediction in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) has been studied using clinical and radiographic measurements and by using biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, and tau. Routine blood tests are regularly performed in patients with sTBI and could be used to predict outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether routine blood tests on admission can be predictive of outcome in patients with sTBI., METHODS: Patients with sTBI were selected from 2 institutional databases based on International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision codes for traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventilatory assistance >24 hours, intracranial pressure monitoring, and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score <=8. Laboratory parameters included blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelets, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, sodium, and potassium. Clinical outcome was measured as hospital length of stay, 30-day mortality, and favorable versus unfavorable outcome based on Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months., RESULTS: A total of 255 adult patients were selected. Median Injury Severity Score was 14.00 (interquartile range, 9.00-22.00). Of patients, 25.9% died within 30 days and 56.1% had an unfavorable outcome at 3 months. On multivariate analysis, low sodium level was significant for 30-day mortality and high sodium level was significant for unfavorable outcome at 3 months. However, after correction for multiple testing, no routine blood test remained significant., CONCLUSIONS: No routine blood tests measured on admission were significant predictors of outcome in patients with sTBI.

We aimed to explore directions for a more refined multidimensional classification system. For that purpose, we performed a hypothesis-free cluster analysis in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research for TBI (CENTER-TBI) database: a European all-severity TBI cohort (n = 4509). The first building block consisted of key imaging characteristics, summarized using principal component analysis from 12 imaging characteristics. The other building blocks were demographics, clinical severity, secondary insults, and cause of injury. With these building blocks, the patients were clustered into four groups. We applied bootstrap resampling with replacement to study the stability of cluster allocation. The characteristics that predominantly defined the clusters were injury cause, major extracranial injury, and GCS. The clusters consisted of 1451, 1534, 1006, and 518 patients, respectively. The clustering method was quite stable: the proportion of patients staying in one cluster after resampling and reclustering was 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.6-99.9%). These clusters characterized groups of patients with different functional outcomes: from mild to severe, 12%, 19%, 36%, and 58% of patients had unfavorable 6 month outcome. Compared with the mild and the upper intermediate cluster, the lower intermediate and the severe cluster received more key interventions. To conclude, four types of TBI patients may be defined by injury mechanism, presence of major extracranial injury and GCS.

To date, this has been documented without accounting for standard baseline admission characteristics and intracranial pressure (ICP).

We derived PRx as the correlation between ICP and mean arterial pressure in prospectively collected multi-center data from the High-Resolution Intensive Care Unit (ICU) cohort of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) study. Multi-variable logistic regression models were analyzed to assess the association between global outcome (measured as either mortality or dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended [GOSE]) and a range of covariates (IMPACT [International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials] Core and computed tomography [CT] variables, ICP, and PRx). Performance of these models in outcome association was compared using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and Nagelkerke's pseudo-R2. One hundred ninety-three patients had a complete data set for analysis. The addition of percent time above threshold for PRx improved AUC and displayed statistically significant increases in Nagelkerke's pseudo-R2 over the IMPACT Core and IMPACT Core + CT models for mortality. The addition of PRx monitoring to IMPACT Core +/- CT + ICP models accounted for additional variance in mortality, when compared to models with IMPACT Core +/- CT + ICP alone. The addition of cerebrovascular reactivity monitoring, through PRx, provides a statistically significant increase in association with mortality at 6 months.

We aimed to assess the prognostic implication of positive (+ve) Troponins (Tn) measurements by conventional (cTnT) versus High-Sensitivity (HsTnT) assay in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for patients who were admitted with TBI. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, troponin assay results, TBI lesions, and hospital outcomes were analyzed and compared based on troponin assay (cTnT versus HsTnT)., RESULTS: Across the study period, 654 patients with TBI had troponin levels measured within 24 h postinjury (cTnT=252 and HsTnT=402). The mean age was 31 years and 46% had positive troponins. There were 147 deaths (22.5%); of them 54% had +ve HsTnT, 23% had +ve cTnT, 16% had -ve cTnT and 7% had -ve HsTnT). When the troponins were tested <=4 h postinjury, the mortality was 10.2% in patients with -ve cTnT and 4% in patients with -ve HsTnT. There was no documented obvious direct trauma to the heart. Overall, patients with positive troponins had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), higher Injury Severity Scores and higher rates of brain edema (P=0.001), pneumonia and sepsis (P=0.001) than those with negative troponin results.

For a total of 3392 patients (2244 males and 1148 females, median age = 51 years) enrolled in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study, we extracted 96 Common Data Elements (CDEs) from the structured reports, spanning all three levels of pathoanatomic information (i.e., 20 ""basic,"" 60 ""descriptive,"" and 16 ""advanced"" CDE variables per patient). Six-month clinical outcome scores were dichotomized into favorable (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOS-E] = 5-8) versus unfavorable (GOS-E = 1-4). Regularized logistic regression models were constructed and compared using the optimism-corrected area under the curve (AUC). An abnormality was reported for the majority of patients (64.51%). In 79.11% of those patients, there was at least one coexisting pathoanatomic lesion or associated finding. An increase in lesion severity, laterality, and volume was associated with more unfavorable outcomes. Compared with the full set of pathoanatomic descriptors (i.e., all three categories of information), reporting ""basic"" CDE information provides at least equal discrimination between patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome (AUC = 0.8121 vs. 0.8155, respectively). Addition of a selected subset of ""descriptive"" detail to the basic CDEs could improve outcome prediction (AUC = 0.8248). Addition of ""advanced"" or ""emerging/exploratory"" information had minimal prognostic value. Our results show that the NINDS standardized-imaging based pathoanatomic descriptors can be used in large-scale studies and provide important insights into acute TBI lesion patterns.

Spreading depolarizations, a mechanism of lesion development in animal models, are a novel candidate for clinical monitoring in patients with brain trauma who need surgery., Objective: To test the null hypothesis that spreading depolarizations are not associated with worse neurologic outcomes., Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study was conducted from February 2009 to August 2013 in 5 level 1 trauma centers. Consecutive patients who required neurological surgery for treatment of acute brain trauma and for whom research consent could be obtained were enrolled; participants were excluded because of technical problems in data quality, patient withdrawal, or loss to follow-up. Primary statistical analysis took place from April to December 2018. Evaluators of outcome assessments were blinded to other measures., Interventions: A 6-contact electrode strip was placed on the brain surface during surgery for continuous electrocorticography during intensive care., Main Outcomes and Measures: Electrocorticography was scored for depolarizations, following international consensus procedures.

The goal of this study was to further explore these associations using prospective, multi-center data from the Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) and to further explore the relationship between autoregulatory failure, lesion progression, and patient outcome. A total of 88 subjects from the CENTER-TBI High Resolution ICU Sub-Study cohort were included. All patients had an admission computed tomography (CT) scan and early repeat scan available, as well as high-frequency neurophysiological recordings covering the between-scan interval. Using a novel, semiautomated approach at lesion segmentation, we calculated absolute changes in volume of contusion core, pericontusional edema, and extra-axial hemorrhage between the imaging studies. We then evaluated associations between cerebrovascular reactivity metrics and radiological lesion progression using mixed-model regression. Analyses were adjusted for baseline covariates and non-neurophysiological factors associated with lesion growth using multi-variate methods. Impairment in cerebrovascular reactivity was significantly associated with progression of pericontusional edema and, to a lesser degree, intraparenchymal hemorrhage. In contrast, there were no significant associations with extra-axial hemorrhage. The strongest relationships were observed between RAC-based metrics and edema formation. Pulse amplitude index showed weaker, but consistent, associations with contusion growth. Cerebrovascular reactivity metrics remained strongly associated with lesion progression after taking into account contributions from non-neurophysiological factors and mean cerebral perfusion pressure. Total hemorrhagic core and edema volumes on repeat CT were significantly larger in patients who were deceased at 6 months, and the amount of edema was greater in patients with an unfavourable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 1-4).

The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on 12 month Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) outcome.,"Humphries, Thomas Jackson; Ingram, Sarah; Sinha, Saurabh; Lecky, Fiona; Dawson, Jeremy; Singh, Rajiv","Objectives: To assess the impact of social deprivation on Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) global outcome. Design: The study was a prospective observational study conducted using consecutive admissions with TBI. Subjects: 1322 consecutive adult patients with TBI were recruited into the study between 2010 and 2015. Methods: All patients were assessed by the TBI rehabilitation team at both six weeks and 12 months following TBI. Details of the injury and demographic data was collated at six weeks. This included age, gender and ZIP Code. Social deprivation was measured by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) Score. The outcome measure used was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE) at 12 months. Univariate analysis was followed by a Multi-Ordinal Regression to evaluate predictor variables. Results: With regard to the representation of IMD deciles, the study population approximated to the general Sheffield population (p = .139). Within the univariate analysis, statistically significant relationships were noted between IMD and GOSE (p = <.001). The Ordinal Regression revealed a significant relationship between worse GOSE and IMD (p = .002), age (p = .001), GCS (p < .001), alcohol intoxication (p < .001) and Medical Comorbidity (p = .041).

A system of radiological criteria for grading and prognosticating temporal lobe contusions.,"Nigam, Pulak; Krishnan, Shyam S; Pande, Anil; Vasudevan, M C","INTRODUCTION: Temporal contusions are common in patients with head injuries and require close monitoring due to the propensity of these patients to deteriorate rapidly and fatally. This study attempts to introduce a radiological grading system for temporal lobe contusions and analyse its prognostic value so as to better identify patients at risk of deterioration., METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional observational study from April 2011-March 2017 on 42 patients with temporal lobe contusion. Each patients was graded according to the proposed system from a minimum of four to a maximum of 13 and then further grouped in three grades - grade 1 (score = 4), grade 2 (score 5-7) and grade 3 (score > 7) - and their clinical course was closely observed., RESULTS: The minimum and maximum scores observed were four and 11 respectively. The proposed grading system has statistically significant correlation to the Glasgow Coma Scale (p-value < 0.05). All patients in grade 1 (17) could be managed conservatively, while all those in grade 3 (five) needed immediate surgical intervention. Of 20 patients in grade 2, 11 had a score of 5-6 and did not require surgery, whereas nine patients had a score of seven and of these eight required delayed surgical intervention. This correlation was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The proposed temporal lobe contusion grading system is a good radiological tool to predict the clinical course of patients and thereby identify patients at higher risk of delayed deterioration.",2020,/,The neuroradiology journal,33,2,179-185,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1971400919893114,31964226,#4847,Nigam 2020,,yes
Comparison of the CRASH Score-Predicted and Real Outcome of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Retrospective Analysis of 417 Patients.,"Dullaert, Matthias; Oerlemans, Joyce; De Paepe, Peter; Kalala Okito, Jean-Pierre; Hallaert, Giorgio","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to externally validate the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury) clinical calculator as a prognostic tool. Mortality at 14 days and an unfavorable outcome (i.e., Glasgow Outcome Scale score <4) after 6 months were the primary endpoints., METHODS: The study included adult patients admitted to the emergency department of Ghent University Hospital during 2010-2014 with traumatic brain injury. The CRASH score was calculated for every patient and compared with real-life outcome at 14 days and 6 months. Researchers were blinded for each other's results, and each observer either calculated the CRASH score or obtained clinical outcome. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to validate the CRASH calculator. The prognostic value of other variables was tested using logistic regression (P < 0.05 was significant)., RESULTS: Of 417 included patients with traumatic brain injury, 94.7% were still alive at 14 days, and 65% had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score >=4 at 6 months. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 92.1% at 14 days and 90.7% at 6 months (P < 0.05). Calculated cutoff value for the CRASH score at 14 days was 31.50% (sensitivity 0.823, specificity 0.895). At 6 months, calculated cutoff value was 55.75% (sensitivity 0.793, specificity 0.830)., CONCLUSIONS: The CRASH calculator is a good predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury at 14 days and 6 months with high sensitivity and specificity. It does not replace clinical judgment of the physician treating the patient in the emergency department, but it constitutes a useful additional tool. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Unsupervised Machine Learning Reveals Novel Traumatic Brain Injury Patient Phenotypes with Distinct Acute Injury Profiles and Long-Term Outcomes.,"Folweiler, Kaitlin A; Sandsmark, Danielle K; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Cohen, Akiva S; Masino, Aaron J","The heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a core challenge for the success of interventional clinical trials. Data-driven approaches for patient stratification may help to identify TBI patient phenotypes during the acute injury period as well as facilitate targeted trial patient enrollment and analysis of treatment efficacy. In this study, we implemented an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify TBI subpopulations at injury baseline using data from 1213 TBI patients who participated in the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT) Trial. A wrapper framework utilizing generalized low-rank models automatically selected relevant clinical features that were subsequently used to cluster patients using a partitioning around medoids clustering algorithm. Using this approach, we identified three patient phenotypes with unique clinical injury profiles based on a subset of acute injury features. Phenotype-specific differences in long-term functional outcome trajectories were respectively observed at 3 and 6 months after injury. In comparison, when patients were grouped by baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), no differences in baseline clinical feature profiles or long-term outcomes were observed. To test phenotype reproducibility in an external validation data set, we used a K-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify subjects in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot data set into corresponding phenotypes, then measured the Gower's dissimilarities between TRACK-TBI and COBRIT subjects in each phenotype. No significant differences were found between trial subjects within two phenotypes, suggesting that these phenotypes may be generalizable within a broad range of TBI severity. Further, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) outcomes in the TRACK-TBI data set similarly demonstrated phenotype-specific differences in long-term outcomes. Our results suggest that unsupervised machine learning is a promising and effective approach for discovery of novel injury subpopulations over the conventional GCS-based method, and may improve patient selection in future TBI clinical trials.",2020,/,Journal of neurotrauma,37,12,1431-1444,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6705,32008422,#4838,Folweiler 2020,,yes
Reverse shock index multiplied by Glasgow Coma Scale (rSIG) predicts mortality in severe trauma patients with head injury.,"Wan-Ting, Chu; Chin-Hsien, Liao; Cheng-Yu, Lin; Cheng-Yu, Chien; Chi-Chun, Lin; Keng-Wei, Chang; Jiann-Hwa, Chen; Wei-Lung, Chen; Chien-Cheng, Huang; Cherng-Jyr, Lim; Jui-Yuan, Chung","The reverse shock index (rSI), a ratio of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to heart rate (HR), is used to identify prognosis in trauma patients. Multiplying rSI by Glasgow Coma Scale (rSIG) can possibly predict better in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma. However, rSIG has never been used to evaluate the mortality risk in adult severe trauma patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] >= 16) with head injury (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] >= 2) in the emergency department (ED). This retrospective case control study recruited adult severe trauma patients (ISS >= 16) with head injury (head AIS >= 2) who presented to the ED of two major trauma centers between January 01, 2014 and May 31, 2017. Demographic data, vital signs, ISS scores, injury mechanisms, laboratory data, managements, and outcomes were included for the analysis. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to evaluate the accuracy of rSIG score in predicting in-hospital mortality. In total, 438 patients (mean age: 56.48 years; 68.5% were males) were included in this study. In-hospital mortality occurred in 24.7% patients. The median (interquartile range) ISS score was 20 (17-26). Patients with rSIG <= 14 had seven-fold increased risks of mortality than those without rSIG <= 14 (odds ratio: 7.64; 95% confidence interval: 4.69-12.42). Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and area under the curve values for rSIG score were 0.29 and 0.76, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of rSIG <= 14 were 0.71, 0.75, 0.49, and 0.89, respectively.

Traumatic brain injuries in older adults-6 years of data for one UK trauma centre: retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.,"Hawley, Carol; Sakr, Magdy; Scapinello, Sarah; Salvo, Jesse; Wrenn, Paul","OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine the incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults and investigate the relationship between injury characteristics and outcomes., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data submitted to Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database for a major trauma centre in the West Midlands, UK, from 2008 to 2014. The Mayo Scale was used to categorise TBI. All patients were aged >=65 years and were admitted with head or brain injuries meeting TARN inclusion criteria: injury resulting in immediate admission to hospital for 3 days, admitted to a high dependency area or death following trauma. We determined age, gender, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Mayo Score, and the association of outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)) with age and clinical presentation., RESULTS: 4413 patients were admitted with trauma meeting TARN criteria: 1389 were >=65 years and 45% (624) had TBI. For patients >=65 years with TBI, mean age was 79 (range 65-99); 56% were men. Falls accounted for 85% of all TBIs. Most TBIs were moderate/severe (80%) by the Mayo criteria. Of the 279 patients with subdural haematoma, 28% had neurosurgery. Most patients survived TBI (78%); 57% had a good outcome on GOS at discharge (not requiring care package). Mortality was associated with increased age (17% in ages 65-74 years, 19% in 75-84 years, 30% in >=85 years, p=0.03). Outcome was significantly associated with injury severity (p=0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TBI represented 45% of all trauma cases meeting TARN inclusion criteria. Falls at home accounted for most TBIs. Most had moderate/severe TBI, yet over half made a good recovery on GOS. Our data indicate that injury prevention initiatives should focus on home safety.

The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of surgical alternatives for treatment of severe traumatic intracranial hematoma in patients >=65 years old and identify factors that may contribute to the outcome., METHODS: This retrospective study included 112 patients with traumatic intracranial hematoma. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of unfavorable outcome. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to evaluate the outcome., RESULTS: Surgery was performed in 70 (62.5%) patients >=65 years old. A favorable outcome occurred in 33 (47.1%) surgical patients, and 23 (32.9%) surgical patients died. Patients who underwent surgery were less likely to have an unfavorable outcome (52.9% vs. 95.2%) and less likely to die (32.9% vs. 88.1%) at 6 months postinjury compared with patients treated conservatively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (<=5) was a significant factor associated with unfavorable outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 18.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.2-95.5, P < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 4.4-28.5, P < 0.001).

The role of cardiac troponin I in prognostication of patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury.,"Cai, Stephen S; Bonds, Brandon W; Hu, Peter F; Stein, Deborah M","BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction is frequently observed after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI); however, its significance is poorly understood. Our study sought to elucidate the association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation with all-cause in-hospital mortality following isolated sTBI (brain Abbreviated Injury Scale score >=3 and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score <=8, no Abbreviated Injury Scale score >=3 to any other bodily regions)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all adult patients (aged >=18 years) with isolated sTBI admitted to a Level I trauma center between June 2007 and January 2014. Patients must have cTnI values within 24 hours of admission. Mortality risks were examined by Cox proportional hazard model., RESULTS: Of 580 patients identified, 30.9% had detectable cTnI in 24 hours of admission. The median survival time was 4.19 days (interquartile range, 1.27-11.69). When adjusted for potential confounders, patients in the highest cTnI category (>=0.21 ng/mL) had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.88) compared with patients with undetectable cTnI. Mortality risk increased with higher troponin levels (p < 0.0001). This association was more pronounced in patients aged 65 years or younger (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-3.40; p < 0.0001) while, interestingly, insignificant in those older than 65 years (p = 0.0826)., CONCLUSION: Among patients with sTBI, cTnI elevation is associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality via a nonlinear positive trend.

Establishing a Traumatic Brain Injury Program of Care: Benchmarking Outcomes after Institutional Adoption of Evidence-Based Guidelines.,"Tarapore, Phiroz E; Vassar, Mary J; Cooper, Shelly; Lay, Twyila; Galletly, Julia; Manley, Geoffrey T; Huang, Michael C","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a widespread global disease, often with widely varying outcomes. Standardization of care and adherence to established guidelines are central to the effort to improve outcomes. At our level I urban trauma center, we developed and implemented a Joint Commission-certified TBI Program of Care in 2011 and compared our post-implementation patient data set with historical controls, using the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) prognostic model. Historical controls were drawn from the San Francisco General Hospital Traumatic Coma Data Bank (SFGH/TCDB) from 1987 to 1996. Recent era patients were drawn from the NeuroTracker database, a customized electronic medical record used in our clinical practice. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Adherence to four quality-of-care metrics on the clinical service was tracked for 2011-2013. The IMPACT prognostic model was used to calculate expected versus observed mortality for current and historical patient groups. In the historical control group, 832 patients were identified and 6-month mortality was available for 592. Observed 6-month mortality was 49%. In the recent era patient group, 211 patients were identified and 6-month mortality was 38%. The IMPACT prognostic model was applied to each patient group. Areas under the curve for each analysis were >0.85 and goodness of fit was satisfactory, indicating good performance of the IMPACT model. Comparison of observed versus expected deaths in the recent versus the control patient sets revealed a drop of 59% in early mortality. The greatest reductions in mortality were observed in the group of patients with IMPACT-predicted mortality <=50%. Significant progress has been made in reducing the percentage of unexpected deaths in TBI patients. It is likely that major factors include more aggressive management and tracking of compliance with the implementation of guidelines for the management of TBI patients.",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,22,2026-2033,,,26917004,#6777,Tarapore 2016,,yes
Postconcussion syndrome: demographics and predictors in 221 patients.,"Tator, Charles H; Davis, Hannah S; Dufort, Paul A; Tartaglia, Maria Carmella; Davis, Karen D; Ebraheem, Ahmed; Hiploylee, Carmen","OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the demographics and predictors of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in a large series of patients using a novel definition of PCS. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 284 consecutive concussed patients, 221 of whom had PCS on the basis of at least 3 symptoms persisting at least 1 month. This definition of PCS was uniformly employed and is unique in accepting an expanded list of symptoms, in shortening the postconcussion interval to 1 month from 3 months, and in excluding those with focal injuries such as hemorrhages and contusions. RESULTS The 221 cases showed considerable heterogeneity in clinical features of PCS. They averaged 3.3 concussions, with a range of 0 to 12 or more concussions, and 62.4% occurred during sports and recreation. The median duration of PCS was 7 months at the time of examination, with 11.8% lasting more than 2 years, and 23.1% with PCS had only 1 concussion. The average patient age was 27 years (range 10-74 years). The average number of persistent symptoms was 8.1; 26.2% had a previous psychiatric condition, attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a learning disability, or previous migraine headaches. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts and Chiari malformation in PCS exceeded the general population. Additionally, involvement in litigation, presence of extracranial injuries, amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, and female sex were predictive of reporting a high number of symptoms. A prior history of psychiatric conditions or migraines, cause of injury, number of previous concussions, and age did not significantly predict symptom number. Only the number of symptoms reported predicted the duration of PCS. To predict the number of symptoms for those who fulfilled PCS criteria according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), the number of previous concussions was significant. CONCLUSIONS PCS is commonly associated with multiple concussions, but 23.1% in the present series occurred after only 1 concussion. Most patients with PCS had multiple symptoms persisting for months or years. The median duration of PCS was 7 months, with a range up to 26 years. In only 11.3%, the PCS had ended at the time of consultation. Not all predictors commonly cited in the literature align with the findings in this study. This is likely due to differences in the definitions of PCS used in research. These results suggest that the use of ICD-10 and DSM-IV to diagnose PCS may be biased toward those who are vulnerable to concussions or with more severe forms of PCS. It is thus important to redefine PCS based on evidence-based medicine.",2016,/,Journal of neurosurgery,125,5,1206-1216,,,26918481,#6776,Tator 2016,,yes
The Negative Impact of Anemia in Outcome from Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Litofsky, N Scott; Martin, Simon; Diaz, Jenna; Ge, Bin; Petroski, Greg; Miller, Douglas C; Barnes, Stephen L","BACKGROUND: Whether anemia complicating traumatic brain injury (TBI) has an impact on patient outcomes is controversial; therefore, recommendations for blood transfusions for such patients are inconsistent. We hypothesized that patient outcome after TBI would be worse in patients with lower hemoglobin levels., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale >3 with abnormal head computed tomography findings and neurologic injury. The relationships between initial hemoglobin and lowest hemoglobin during hospitalization at threshold values of <=7, <=8, <=9, and <=10 g/dL were investigated relative to Glasgow Outcome Score at last follow-up not exceeding 1 year., RESULTS: Of 939 patients meeting inclusion criteria, initial and lowest hemoglobin concentrations were significant predictors of poor outcome (P < 0.0001). For each 1 g/dL higher hemoglobin value, the likelihood of a good outcome increased by 33%. More severe levels of initial anemia were associated with lower Glasgow Coma Scale, greater head Abbreviated Injury Scale, and greater Injury Severity Score (P < 0.0001). Female patients had worse outcome than male patients only for initial hemoglobin between 7 and 8 g/dL (P < 0.05). Blood transfusion was associated with poorer outcome at hemoglobin levels <=9 and <=10 g/dL (P < 0.05), but not at lower hemoglobin thresholds., CONCLUSIONS: Patient outcome after TBI is worse in patients with lower hemoglobin. Initial hemoglobin and lowest hemoglobin after admission are independently associated with poor outcome. Our data support consideration of blood transfusion when hemoglobin is <=8 g/dl.

Role of signal peptide-Cub-Egf domain-containing protein-1 in serum as a predictive biomarker of outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Chen, Qi-Han; Lin, Dan; Zhou, Jian; Deng, Gang","BACKGROUND: Signal peptide-Cub-Epidermal growth factor domain-containing protein 1 (SCUBE1), a marker for coagulation, is secreted under hypoxia and inflammatory conditions from platelet alpha granules. This study was designed to determine the associations of serum SCUBE1 concentrations with trauma severity and prognosis after severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: Serum SCUBE1 concentrations of 113 patients and 113 controls were measured. An unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3., RESULTS: Serum SCUBE1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in controls (15.5 +/- 6.0 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, P < 0.001) and were associated with Glasgow coma scale scores (r = -0.439, P < 0.001) and blood platelet count (r = 0.420, P < 0.001). SCUBE1 was identified as an independent prognostic marker of 6-month unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.357; 95% confidence interval, 1.159-1.589; P < 0.001), and had high predictive value according to receiver operating characteristic curve (area under curve, 0.830; 95% confidence interval, 0.748-0.890; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum SCUBE1 concentrations are associated highly with trauma severity, platelet activation and poor outcome, suggesting that SCUBE1 might be a novel prognostic biomarker after traumatic brain injury.

Clinical Results and Outcome Improvement Over Time in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Di Deo, Priscilla; Lingsma, Hester; Nieboer, Daan; Roozenbeek, Bob; Citerio, Giuseppe; Beretta, Luigi; Magnoni, Sandra; Zanier, Elisa R; Stocchetti, Nino","Prognostic models for traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important tools both in clinical practice and research if properly validated, preferably by external validation. Prognostic models also offer the possibility of monitoring performance by comparing predicted outcomes with observed outcomes. In this study, we applied the prognostic models developed by the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) in an Italian multi-center database (Neurolink) with two aims: to compare observed with predicted outcomes and to check for a possible improvement of clinical outcome over the 11 years of patient inclusion in Neurolink. We applied the IMPACT models to patients included in Neurolink between 1997 and 2007. Performance of the models was assessed by determining calibration (with calibration plots) and discrimination (by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze a possible trend in outcomes over time, adjusted for predicted outcomes. A total of 1401 patients were studied. Patients had a median age of 40 years and 51% had a Glasgow Coma Scale motor score of 5 or 6. The models showed good discrimination, with AUCs of 0.86 (according to the Core Model) and 0.88 (Extended Model), and adequate calibration, with the overall observed risk of unfavorable outcome and mortality being less than predicted. Outcomes significantly improved over time. This study shows that the IMPACT models performed reasonably well in the Neurolink data and can be used for monitoring performance.

The change of plasma galectin-3 concentrations after traumatic brain injury.,"Shen, Yong-Feng; Yu, Wen-Hua; Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Du, Quan; Yang, Ding-Bo; Wu, Gang-Qun; Zhang, Zu-Yong; Wang, Hao; Jiang, Li","BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 plays a significant role in microglia activation. Its increased circulating concentration has been associated with some inflammatory diseases. In-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs), including acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction, have high prevalence and are strong predictors of mortality after severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). The present study was designed to investigate the relationships between plasma galectin-3 concentrations and trauma severity, in-hospital mortality and IMAEs following STBI., METHODS: Plasma galectin-3 concentrations of 100 STBI patients and 100 controls were determined. Diagnosis of progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction was made on the follow-up computerized tomography scan. Acute traumatic coagulopathy was defined based on coagulation test., RESULTS: Plasma galectin-3 concentrations were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls and also associated highly with Glasgow Coma Scale scores and plasma C-reactive protein concentrations. Galectin-3 emerged as an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality and IMAEs. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of plasma galectin-3 concentrations were similar to those of Glasgow Coma Scale scores for prediction of in-hospital morality and IMAEs., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma galectin-3 concentrations have close relation to inflammation, trauma severity and clinical outcome, suggesting that galectin-3 should have the potential to be a good prognostic biomarker after STBI.

The role of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth inhibitor in clinical outcome of traumatic brain injury.,"Li, Min; Jia, Qiang; Chen, Tongheng; Zhao, Zilong; Chen, Jieli; Zhang, Jianning","OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor superfamily-15 (TNFSF15) also known as vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI) is a cytokine that modulates anti-angiogenesis and inflammation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and vascular permeability following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The balance of VEGF and VEGI may play a key role in the maintenance of vascular and immune system homeostasis in the brain. However, the dynamic changes of circulating VEGF and VEGI after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the correlation between plasma VEGF and plasma VEGI remains obscure. In this study, we were to investigate whether circulating VEGF and VEGI can be used as prognostic markers for patients with TBI., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted in two neurosurgical intensive care units of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Tianjin Huanhu Hospital (Tianjin, China). 40 patients and 30 healthy controls were recruited. The recruited subjects were aged over 18 with randomized gender and GCS. 1mL of blood was withdrawn on 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21days after TBI. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000rpm and the supernatants were used to measure VEGF and VEGI by ELISA kit., RESULTS: 1) Circulating VEGF in TBI patients was decreased on the 1st day after TBI, then climbed up on the 4th day, reaching a maximum level on the14th day after TBI, as compared to normal controls. VEGF level returned to normal level on 21th day after TBI. 2) Circulating VEGI in TBI patients was decreased on the 1st and 4th day after TBI, then climbed up on the 7th day after TBI, reaching a maximum level on 14th day after TBI, as compared to normal controls. VEGI levels declined to normal level on 21th day after TBI. 3) There was a significant positive correlation between circulating VEGF and VEGI. 4) However, TBI patients whose conditions had improved exhibited lower VEGF levels 7days after TBI when compared to TBI patients whose condition had deteriorated. Survivors exhibited higher VEGI levels 7days after TBI when compared to non-survivors. 5)TBI patients whose condition had improved exhibited higher VEGI levels when compared to TBI patients whose condition had deteriorated 21days after TBI. Patients with mild TBI exhibited higher VEGI levels than those with moderate and severe TBI 21days after TBI. 6) A lower rate of recovery and higher hospital mortality were found in patients with VEGF/VEGI ratio>=2.366 as compared to those with VEGF/VEGI ratio<2.366 7days after TBI., CONCLUSIONS: 1) VEGF level positively correlates with VEGI after TBI. 2) The elevation of VEGF exhibits an adverse effect from 4 to 14days after TBI while it has an advantageous effect from 14 to 21days after TBI. Increasing VEGI levels are beneficial in recovery after TBI. Controlling the ratio of VEGF/VEGI may benefit the clinical outcome following TBI. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

After 1 year, 171 patients (32.2%) had died (missing data = 6.6%). Good recovery was seen in 22.7% of the patients, while 20% presented moderate disability. The PAECC score after 1 year was 9.43 +/- 8.72 points (high deterioration). Patients with diffuse injury I had a mean of 5.08 points vs 7.82 in those with diffuse injury II, 11.76 in those with diffuse injury III and 19.29 in those with diffuse injury IV (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis found that QoL after 1 year was associated with CT Marshall classification, depth of coma, age, length of stay, spinal injury and tracheostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TBI had a high mortality rate 1 year after admission, deterioration in QoL and significant impairment of functional status, although more than 40% were normal or self-sufficient.

Autonomic Impairment in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Multimodal Neuromonitoring Study.,"Sykora, Marek; Czosnyka, Marek; Liu, Xiuyun; Donnelly, Joseph; Nasr, Nathalie; Diedler, Jennifer; Okoroafor, Francois; Hutchinson, Peter; Menon, David; Smielewski, Peter","OBJECTIVES: Autonomic impairment after acute traumatic brain injury has been associated independently with both increased morbidity and mortality. Links between autonomic impairment and increased intracranial pressure or impaired cerebral autoregulation have been described as well. However, relationships between autonomic impairment, intracranial pressure, impaired cerebral autoregulation, and outcome remain poorly explored. Using continuous measurements of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity we aimed to test whether autonomic markers are associated with functional outcome and mortality independently of intracranial variables. Further, we aimed to evaluate the relationships between autonomic functions, intracranial pressure, and cerebral autoregulation., DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database., SETTING: Neurocritical care unit in a university hospital., SUBJECTS: Sedated patients with severe traumatic brain injury., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Waveforms of intracranial pressure and arterial blood pressure, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale and 6 months Glasgow Outcome Scale were recorded. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed every 10 seconds using a modified cross-correlational method. Frequency domain analyses of heart rate variability were performed automatically every 10 seconds from a moving 300 seconds of the monitoring time window. Mean values of baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and impaired cerebral autoregulation over the entire monitoring period were calculated for each patient. Two hundred and sixty-two patients with a median age of 36 years entered the analysis. The median admission Glasgow Coma Scale was 6, the median Glasgow Outcome Scale was 3, and the mortality at 6 months was 23%. Baroreflex sensitivity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.9; p = 0.02) and relative power of a high frequency band of heart rate variability (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; p < 0.001) were individually associated with mortality, independently of age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, intracranial pressure, pressure reactivity index, or cerebral perfusion pressure. Baroreflex sensitivity showed no correlation with intracranial pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure; the correlation with pressure reactivity index was strong in older patients (age, > 60 yr). The relative power of high frequency correlated significantly with intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure, but not with pressure reactivity index. The relative power of low frequency correlated significantly with pressure reactivity index., CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic impairment, as measured by heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, is significantly associated with increased mortality after traumatic brain injury. These effects, though partially interlinked, seem to be independent of age, trauma severity, intracranial pressure, or autoregulatory status, and thus represent a discrete phenomenon in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury.

Depression Trajectories during the First Year after Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Bombardier, Charles H; Hoekstra, Trynke; Dikmen, Sureyya; Fann, Jesse R","Major depression is prevalent after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and associated with poor outcomes. Little is known about the course of depression after TBI. Participants were 559 consecutively admitted patients with mild to severe TBI recruited from inpatient units at Harborview Medical Center, a Level I trauma center in Seattle, WA. Participants were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression measure at months 1-6, 8, 10, and 12 post-injury. We used linear latent class growth mixture modeling (LCGMM) of PHQ-9 total scores to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct longitudinal trajectories. A four-class LCGMM had good fit indices and clinical interpretability. Trajectory groups were: low depression (70.1%), delayed depression (13.2%), depression recovery (10.4%), and persistent depression (6.3%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to distinguish trajectory classes based on baseline demographic, psychiatric history, and clinical variables. Relative to the low depression group, the other three groups were consistently more likely to have a pre-injury history of other mental health disorders or major depressive disorder, a positive toxicology screen for cocaine or amphetamines at the time of injury, and a history of alcohol dependence. They were less likely to be on Medicare versus commercial insurance. Trajectories based on LCGMM are an empirical and clinically meaningful way to characterize distinct courses of depression after TBI. When combined with baseline predictors, this line of research may improve our ability to predict prognosis and target groups who may benefit from treatment or secondary prevention efforts (e.g., proactive telephone counseling).",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,23,2115-2124,,,26979826,#6752,Bombardier 2016,,yes
Predicting Outcomes after Severe and Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury: An External Validation of Impact and Crash Prognostic Models in a Large Spanish Cohort.,"Castano-Leon, Ana M; Lora, David; Munarriz, Pablo M; Cepeda, Santiago; Paredes, Igor; de la Cruz, Javier; Gomez Lopez, Pedro A; Lagares, Alfonso","Prognostic models that were developed by the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) study group and the Corticosteroid Randomization After Signification Head injury (CRASH) collaborators are the most commonly used prognostic models for outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although they have been considered to be useful tools in clinical practice, a continuous process of external validation in recent cohorts of different populations is necessary. The objective of this study was to determine the external validity and compare the IMPACT and CRASH-refitted models for prediction of outcomes after moderate or severe TBI in a non-selected 1301-patient Spanish cohort. We studied discrimination, calibration, and overall fit as external validation measures. Excellent discrimination was indicated (area under the curve [AUC] 0.78-0.87) by the higher values in the validation than in the development sample for both models and outcomes. Calibration revealed that IMPACT models, in general, predict lower probabilities of both outcomes (mortality and disability). In contrast, CRASH-refitted models provided higher predicted probabilities than those observed. We can conclude that both models demonstrate an adequate performance in our representative traumatic brain Mediterranean population. Therefore, these models can be sensibly applied in our clinical practice so long as their limitations are observed during individual outcome prediction.",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,17,1598-606,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4182,26982260,#6751,Castano-Leon 2016,,yes

Stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare the prediction of (1) in-ICU mortality and (2) unfavourable outcome at 3 months post-injury using as predictors either the FOUR score or GCS along with other factors that may affect patient outcome. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were used to compare the discriminant ability and predictive power of the models. The internal validation was performed with bootstrap technique and expressed as accuracy rate (AcR)., RESULTS: The FOUR score, age, the CT Rotterdam score, systolic ABP and being placed on ventilator within day one (model 1: AUC: 0.906 +/- 0.024; AcR: 80.3 +/- 4.8%) performed equally well in predicting in-ICU mortality as the combination of GCS with the same set of predictors plus pupil reactivity (model 2: AUC: 0.913 +/- 0.022; AcR: 81.1 +/- 4.8%).

Prognostic models for prediction of outcomes after traumatic brain injury based on patients admission characteristics.,"Kamal, Vineet Kumar; Agrawal, Deepak; Pandey, Ravindra Mohan","OBJECTIVE: To identify the best performing prognostic model using admission characteristics to predict mortality at 30 days and functioning outcome at 6-months post-admission in patients with moderate or severe brain injury., METHODS: Using a retrospective database (n = 1466 patients) of a tertiary trauma care centre, three different models were developed using logistic regression methods for predicting mortality and functioning outcome. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. The models were validated using split sample method. For facilitating clinical usefulness, score charts were derived from the regression models., RESULTS: The variables motor score, hypotension, pupillary reactivity, age, creatinine level, limb movement (hemiparesis), and tSAH/IVH were found to be the most predictive independent prognostic factors of both mortality and functioning outcome. For both the outcomes, discriminative ability of the three prognostic models was excellent in the development dataset (AUC = 0.845--0.905) as well as the validation data set (AUC = 0.836-0.880). Calibration in the validation data set for model-2 was good (H-L test p-value > 0.05); however, for model-1 and model-3, it was poor (H-L test p-value < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: For clinical decision-making, model-2 is recommended on the basis of good performance in predicting outcomes in patients with moderate or severe TBI in India and other similar countries.",2016,/,Brain injury,30,4,393-406,,,27003280,#6745,Kamal 2016,,yes
Effect of the Suboccipital Musculature on Symptom Severity and Recovery after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Fakhran, S; Qu, C; Alhilali, L M","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neck musculature mass has been suggested as a biomechanical contributor to injury severity in mild traumatic brain injury. We sought to determine how the cross-sectional areas of the suboccipital muscles affect symptom severity, neurocognitive performance, and recovery time in patients with mild traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with mild traumatic brain injury underwent MR imaging and serial neurocognitive testing with the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test. Cross-sectional areas of the rectus capitis posterior musculature were retrospectively obtained at C1, and cross-sectional areas of the remaining 7 suboccipital muscles were measured at C2. Cross-sectional area reproducibility was evaluated. Overall and individual muscle cross-sectional areas were correlated with symptom severity, neuropsychological testing, recovery time, and headache., RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with mild traumatic brain injury had imaging through C1, and 43 had imaging through C2. Reproducibility of cross-sectional area measurements was substantial (correlation coefficients = 0.9517-0.9891). Lower cross-sectional area of the rectus capitis posterior minor was correlated with greater symptom severity (r = 0.596, P < .0001), longer recovery time (r = 0.387, P = .002), poor verbal memory performance (r = 0.285, P = .02), and headache (r = 0.39, P = .001). None of the other cross-sectional areas were associated with symptom severity, recovery time, neurocognitive testing, or headache., CONCLUSIONS: In mild traumatic brain injury, the rectus capitis posterior minor is the only suboccipital muscle whose cross-sectional area is associated with symptom severity and worse outcome. Given the unique connection of this muscle to the dura, this finding may suggest that pathology of the myodural bridge contributes to symptomatology and prognosis in mild traumatic brain injury.

Predictors of cognitive and physical fatigue in post-acute mild-moderate traumatic brain injury.,"Schiehser, Dawn M; Delano-Wood, Lisa; Jak, Amy J; Hanson, Karen L; Sorg, Scott F; Orff, Henry; Clark, Alexandra L","Post-traumatic fatigue (PTF) is a common, disabling, and often chronic symptom following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, the impact of chronic cognitive and physical fatigue and their associations with psychiatric, sleep, cognitive, and psychosocial sequelae in mild-moderate TBI remain poorly understood. Sixty Veterans with a history of mild-moderate TBI and 40 Veteran controls (VC) were administered the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, a validated measure of TBI-related cognitive and physical fatigue as well as measures of neuropsychiatric, psychosocial, sleep, and objective cognitive functioning. Compared to VC, TBI Veterans endorsed significantly greater levels of cognitive and physical fatigue. In TBI, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) were associated with both cognitive and physical fatigue, while loss of consciousness (LOC) and poor attention/processing speed were related to elevations in cognitive fatigue only. In regression analyses, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and LOC significantly predicted cognitive fatigue, while only post-traumatic stress symptoms and PTA contributed to physical fatigue. Cognitive and physical fatigue are problematic symptoms following mild-moderate TBI that are differentially associated with specific injury and psychiatric sequelae.

Conscious status predicts mortality among patients with isolated traumatic brain injury in administrative data.,"Alsulaim, Hatim A; Smart, Blair J; Asemota, Anthony O; Haring, R Sterling; Canner, Joseph K; Efron, David T; Haut, Elliott R; Schneider, Eric B","BACKGROUND: Outcome studies in trauma using administrative data traditionally employ anatomy-based definitions of injury severity; however, physiologic factors, including consciousness, may correlate with outcomes. We examined whether accounting for conscious status in administrative data improved mortality prediction among patients with moderate to severe TBI., METHODS: Patients meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for TBI in the 2006 to 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample were identified. Patients were dichotomized as having no/brief loss of consciousness (LOC) vs extended LOC greater than 1 hour using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) fifth digit modifiers. Receiver operating curves compared the ability of logistic regression to predict mortality in models that included LOC vs models that did not., RESULTS: Overall, 98,397 individuals met criteria, of whom 25.8% had extended LOC. In univariate analysis, AIS alone predicted mortality in 69.6% of patients (area under receiver operating characteristic curve .696, 95% CI .689 to .702), extended LOC alone predicted mortality in 76.8% (AUROC .768, 95% CI .764 to .773), and a combination of AIS and extended LOC predicted mortality in 82.6% of cases (AUROC .826, 95% CI .821 to .830). Similar differences were observed in best-fit models., CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for LOC along with anatomical measures of injury severity improves mortality prediction among patients with moderate/severe TBI in administrative datasets.

Injury severity measures for predicting return-to-work after a traumatic brain injury.,"Chien, Ding-Kuo; Hwang, Hei-Fen; Lin, Mau-Roung","This study compared the ability of five injury severity measures, namely the Abbreviated Injury Scale to the Head (AIS-H), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), and Injury Severity Score (ISS), to predict return-to-work after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Furthermore, factors potentially associated with return-to-work were investigated. In total, 207 individuals aged <=65 years newly diagnosed with a TBI and employed at the time of injury were recruited and followed-up for 1year by telephone every 3 months. A bivariate proportional hazards model analysis revealed that all five injury severity measures were significantly associated with return-to-work after a TBI. The AIS-H and non-head ISS explained 23.8% of the variation in the duration of returning to work from discharge after hospitalization for a TBI; similarly, the GCS, GOS, GOSE, and ISS respectively accounted for 4.7%, 21.4%, 12.9%, and 48.4% of the variation. A multivariable analysis revealed that individuals with higher injury severity as measured by the ISS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.97), a lack of autonomy in transportation (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.23-5.32), cognitive impairment (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.79), and depression (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) were significantly less likely to be employed after a TBI. In conclusion, of the five injury severity measures, the ISS may be the most capable measure of predicting return-to-work after a TBI. In addition to injury severity, autonomy in transportation, cognitive function, and the depressive status may also influence the employment status during the first year after a TBI.

Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity monitoring using wavelet analysis in traumatic brain injury patients: A retrospective study.,"Liu, Xiuyun; Donnelly, Joseph; Czosnyka, Marek; Aries, Marcel J H; Brady, Ken; Cardim, Danilo; Robba, Chiara; Cabeleira, Manuel; Kim, Dong-Joo; Haubrich, Christina; Hutchinson, Peter J; Smielewski, Peter","BACKGROUND: After traumatic brain injury (TBI), the ability of cerebral vessels to appropriately react to changes in arterial blood pressure (pressure reactivity) is impaired, leaving patients vulnerable to cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Although, the traditional pressure reactivity index (PRx) has demonstrated that impaired pressure reactivity is associated with poor patient outcome, PRx is sometimes erratic and may not be reliable in various clinical circumstances. Here, we introduce a more robust transform-based wavelet pressure reactivity index (wPRx) and compare its performance with the widely used traditional PRx across 3 areas: its stability and reliability in time, its ability to give an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) recommendation, and its relationship with patient outcome., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Five hundred and fifteen patients with TBI admitted in Addenbrooke's Hospital, United Kingdom (March 23rd, 2003 through December 9th, 2014), with continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP), were retrospectively analyzed to calculate the traditional PRx and a novel wavelet transform-based wPRx. wPRx was calculated by taking the cosine of the wavelet transform phase-shift between ABP and ICP. A time trend of CPPopt was calculated using an automated curve-fitting method that determined the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) at which the pressure reactivity (PRx or wPRx) was most efficient (CPPopt_PRx and CPPopt_wPRx, respectively). There was a significantly positive relationship between PRx and wPRx (r = 0.73), and wavelet wPRx was more reliable in time (ratio of between-hour variance to total variance, wPRx 0.957 +/- 0.0032 versus PRx and 0.949 +/- 0.047 for PRx, p = 0.002). The 2-hour interval standard deviation of wPRx (0.19 +/- 0.07) was smaller than that of PRx (0.30 +/- 0.13, p < 0.001). wPRx performed better in distinguishing between mortality and survival (the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUROC] for wPRx was 0.73 versus 0.66 for PRx, p = 0.003). The mean difference between the patients' CPP and their CPPopt was related to outcome for both calculation methods. There was a good relationship between the 2 CPPopts (r = 0.814, p < 0.001). CPPopt_wPRx was more stable than CPPopt_PRx (within patient standard deviation 7.05 +/- 3.78 versus 8.45 +/- 2.90; p < 0.001). Key limitations include that this study is a retrospective analysis and only compared wPRx with PRx in the cohort of patients with TBI.

Temporal profile of intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular reactivity in severe traumatic brain injury and association with fatal outcome: An observational study.,"Adams, Hadie; Donnelly, Joseph; Czosnyka, Marek; Kolias, Angelos G; Helmy, Adel; Menon, David K; Smielewski, Peter; Hutchinson, Peter J","BACKGROUND: Both intracranial pressure (ICP) and the cerebrovascular pressure reactivity represent the dysregulation of pathways directly involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathogenesis and have been used to inform clinical management. However, how these parameters evolve over time following injury and whether this evolution has any prognostic importance have not been studied., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed the temporal profile of ICP and pressure reactivity index (PRx), examined their relation to TBI-specific mortality, and determined if the prognostic relevance of these parameters was affected by their temporal profile using mixed models for repeated measures of ICP and PRx for the first 240 hours from the time of injury. A total of 601 adults with TBI, admitted between September 2002 to January 2016, and with high-resolution continuous monitoring from a single centre, were studied. At 6 months postinjury, 133 (19%) patients had a fatal outcome; of those, 88 (78%) died from nonsurvivable TBI or brain death. The difference in mean ICP between those with a fatal outcome and functional survivors was only significant for the first 168 hours after injury (all p < 0.05). For PRx, those patients with a fatal outcome also had a higher (more impaired) PRx throughout the first 120 hours after injury (all p < 0.05). The separation of ICP and PRx was greatest in the first 72 hours after injury. Mixed models demonstrated that the explanatory power of the PRx decreases over time; therefore, the prognostic weight assigned to PRx should similarly decrease. However, the ability of ICP to predict a fatal outcome remained relatively stable over time. As control of ICP is the central purpose of TBI management, it is likely that some of the information that is reflected in the natural history of ICP changes is no longer apparent because of therapeutic intervention., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the temporal evolution of ICP and PRx and their relationship with fatal outcome, indicating a potential early prognostic and therapeutic window. The combination of dynamic monitoring variables and their time profile improved prediction of outcome. Therefore, time-driven dynamic modelling of outcome in patients with severe TBI may allow for more accurate and clinically useful prediction models. Further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.",2017,/,PLoS medicine,14,7,e1002353,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002353,28742817,#5970,Adams 2017,,yes
Individualizing Thresholds of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Using Estimated Limits of Autoregulation.,"Donnelly, Joseph; Czosnyka, Marek; Adams, Hadie; Robba, Chiara; Steiner, Luzius A; Cardim, Danilo; Cabella, Brenno; Liu, Xiuyun; Ercole, Ari; Hutchinson, Peter John; Menon, David Krishna; Aries, Marcel J H; Smielewski, Peter","OBJECTIVES: In severe traumatic brain injury, cerebral perfusion pressure management based on cerebrovascular pressure reactivity index has the potential to provide a personalized treatment target to improve patient outcomes. So far, the methods have focused on identifying ""one"" autoregulation-guided cerebral perfusion pressure target-called ""cerebral perfusion pressure optimal"". We investigated whether a cerebral perfusion pressure autoregulation range-which uses a continuous estimation of the ""lower"" and ""upper"" cerebral perfusion pressure limits of cerebrovascular pressure autoregulation (assessed with pressure reactivity index)-has prognostic value., DESIGN: Single-center retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data., SETTING: The neurocritical care unit at a tertiary academic medical center., PATIENTS: Data from 729 severe traumatic brain injury patients admitted between 1996 and 2016 were used. Treatment was guided by controlling intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure according to a local protocol., INTERVENTIONS: None., METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral perfusion pressure-pressure reactivity index curves were fitted automatically using a previously published curve-fitting heuristic from the relationship between pressure reactivity index and cerebral perfusion pressure. The cerebral perfusion pressure values at which this ""U-shaped curve"" crossed the fixed threshold from intact to impaired pressure reactivity (pressure reactivity index = 0.3) were denoted automatically the ""lower"" and ""upper"" cerebral perfusion pressure limits of reactivity, respectively. The percentage of time with cerebral perfusion pressure below (%cerebral perfusion pressure  upper limit of reactivity), or within these reactivity limits (%cerebral perfusion pressure within limits of reactivity) was calculated for each patient and compared across dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scores. After adjusting for age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale, and mean intracranial pressure, percentage of time with cerebral perfusion pressure less than lower limit of reactivity was associated with unfavorable outcome (odds ratio %cerebral perfusion pressure < lower limit of reactivity, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; p < 0.001) and mortality (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.08; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Individualized autoregulation-guided cerebral perfusion pressure management may be a plausible alternative to fixed cerebral perfusion pressure threshold management in severe traumatic brain injury patients.

Subdural hematoma as a major determinant of short-term outcomes in traumatic brain injury.,"Lee, Jonathan J; Segar, David J; Morrison, John F; Mangham, William M; Lee, Shane; Asaad, Wael F","OBJECTIVE Early radiographic findings in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been studied in hopes of better predicting injury severity and outcome. However, prior attempts have generally not considered the various types of intracranial hemorrhage in isolation and have typically not excluded patients with potentially confounding extracranial injuries. Therefore, the authors examined the associations of various radiographic findings with short-term outcome to assess the potential utility of these findings in future prognostic models. METHODS The authors retrospectively identified 1716 patients who had experienced TBI without major extracranial injuries, and categorized them into the following TBI subtypes: subdural hematoma (SDH), traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage (which included intraventricular hemorrhage), and epidural hematoma. They specifically considered isolated forms of hemorrhage, in which only 1 subtype was present. RESULTS In general, the presence of an isolated SDH was more likely to result in worse outcomes than the presence of other isolated forms of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Discharge to home was less likely and perihospital mortality rates were generally higher in patients with SDH. These findings were not simply related to age and were not fully captured by the admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. The presence of SDH had a much higher sensitivity for poor outcome than the presence of other TBI subtypes, and was more sensitive for these poor outcomes than having a low GCS score (3-8). CONCLUSIONS In these ways, SDH was the most important finding associated with poor outcome, and the authors show that consideration of SDH, specifically, can augment age and GCS score in classification and prognostic models for TBI.",2018,/,Journal of neurosurgery,128,1,236-249,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2016.5.JNS16255,28186445,#5948,Lee 2018,,yes

Outcome evaluation was prospectively done at 6-month follow-up according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale., RESULTS: A total of 290 patients were included in the study. Forty-seven patients (16.2%) died within 6 months post-TBI, and 74 patients (25.5%) had an unfavorable outcome. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed that there was no difference between observed and predicted outcomes; hence, the 3 models displayed adequate calibration for predicting 6-month mortality or unfavorable outcome. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the 3 models (Core, Extended, and Lab) could accurately discriminate between favorable and unfavorable outcomes, as well as between survival and mortality (P < .001)., CONCLUSION: The IMPACT model validates prediction of 6-month outcomes in a Spanish population of moderate-severe TBI.

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Score Independently Predicts Poor Outcome in Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Jacome, Tomas; Tatum, Danielle","INTRODUCTION: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is frequently observed after various types of acute cerebral injury and has been linked to clinical deterioration in non-traumatic brain injury (TBI). SIRS scores have also been shown to be predictive of length of stay and mortality in trauma patients. We aimed to determine the prognostic utility of SIRS present at admission in trauma patients with isolated TBI., METHODS: This was a 5-year retrospective cohort study of adults (>=18 years) with isolated TBI admitted to a Level II trauma center. The prognostic value of SIRS, total SIRS scores, and each SIRS criterion was examined by Chi 2 and logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Of the 330 patients identified, 50 (15.2%) met SIRS criteria. SIRS was significantly associated with poor outcome (P < 0.001). Relative risk of poor outcome was 2.7 times higher in patients with a SIRS score of 2 on admission (P = 0.007) and increased significantly to 6.5 times in patients with a SIRS score of 3 (P = 0.002). Logistic regression demonstrated SIRS and each criterion to be significant independent prognostic factors (SIRS, P = 0.030; body temperature, P = 0.006; tachypnea, P = 0.022, tachycardia P = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: SIRS at admission is an independent predictor of poor outcome in isolated TBI patients. These data demonstrate SIRS to be an important clinical tool that may be used in facilitating prognostication, particularly in elderly trauma patients.

This study was to evaluate whether there is any independent impact of tHcy levels on neurological outcome following head injury in a multivariate model. Patients admitted within 24 h of injury were included in the study, along with 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Plasma levels of tHcy were measured at admission using direct immunoassay. All the variables were analyzed with respect to tHcy levels and outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS 21. There were a total of 72 patients in the study. tHcy levels were significantly higher after head injury (mean 24.03[SD +/- 16.0] mumol/L), compared to matched controls (mean 16.62 [SD +/- 10.4] mumol/L) (p = 0.05).

Coagulopathy as a predictor of mortality after penetrating traumatic brain injury.,"Folkerson, Lindley E; Sloan, Duncan; Davis, Elizabeth; Kitagawa, Ryan S; Cotton, Bryan A; Holcomb, John B; Tomasek, Jeffrey S; Wade, Charles E","STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality with penetrating TBI (p-TBI) patients having worse outcomes. These patients are more likely to be coagulopathic than blunt TBI (b-TBI) patients, thus we hypothesize that coagulopathy would be an early predictor of mortality., METHODS: We identified highest-level trauma activation patients who underwent an admission head CT and had ICU admission orders from August 2009-May 2013, excluding those with polytrauma and anticoagulant use. Rapid thrombelastography (rTEG) was obtained after emergency department (ED) arrival and coagulopathy was defined as follows: ACT>=128s, KT>=2.5s, angle<=56degree, MA<=55mm, LY-30>=3.0% or platelet count<=150,000/muL. Regression modeling was used to assess the association of coagulopathy on mortality., RESULTS: 1086 patients with head CT scans performed and ICU admission orders were reviewed. After exclusion criteria were met, 347 patients with isolated TBI were analyzed-99 (29%) with p-TBI and 248 (71%) with b-TBI. Patients with p-TBI had a higher mortality (41% vs. 10%, p<0.0001) and a greater incidence of coagulopathy (64% vs. 51%, p<0.003). After dichotomizing p-TBI patients by mortality, patients who died were younger and were more coagulopathic. When adjusting for factors available on ED arrival, coagulopathy was found to be an early predictor of mortality (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.37, 11.72, p-value=0.012)., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that p-TBI patients with significant coagulopathy have a poor prognosis. Coagulopathy, in conjunction with other factors, can be used to earlier identify p-TBI patients with worse outcomes and represents a possible area for intervention. Copyright © 2017.

High fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product to fibrinogen ratio is associated with 28-day mortality and massive transfusion in severe trauma.,"Lee, D H; Lee, B K; Noh, S M; Cho, Y S","PURPOSE: There is a lack of association between coagulation biomarkers and long-term mortality in severe trauma. We aimed to investigate the association between coagulation biomarkers on admission and outcome of late stage of trauma., METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients admitted with severe trauma between 2012 and 2015. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of coagulation biomarkers to determine 28-day mortality. Head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores greater than 3 were defined as traumatic brain injury (TBI). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcome was massive transfusion., RESULTS: Of the 1266 patients included in the study, 28-day mortality rate was 19.7% (n = 249) and 7.9% (n = 100) of patients received massive transfusion. The AUROC of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) to fibrinogen ratio had a significantly higher prognostic performance than other markers. Multivariate analysis revealed that D-dimer level [odds ratio (OR) 1.033; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.016-1.051] and FDP/fibrinogen ratio (OR 1.007; 95% CI 1.001-1.013) were independently associated with 28-day mortality.

Hemodynamic Instability and Cardiovascular Events After Traumatic Brain Injury Predict Outcome After Artifact Removal With Deep Belief Network Analysis.,"Kim, Hakseung; Lee, Seung-Bo; Son, Yunsik; Czosnyka, Marek; Kim, Dong-Joo","BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic instability and cardiovascular events heavily affect the prognosis of traumatic brain injury. Physiological signals are monitored to detect these events. However, the signals are often riddled with faulty readings, which jeopardize the reliability of the clinical parameters obtained from the signals. A machine-learning model for the elimination of artifactual events shows promising results for improving signal quality. However, the actual impact of the improvements on the performance of the clinical parameters after the elimination of the artifacts is not well studied., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The arterial blood pressure of 99 subjects with traumatic brain injury was continuously measured for 5 consecutive days, beginning on the day of admission. The machine-learning deep belief network was constructed to automatically identify and remove false incidences of hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and alterations in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)., RESULTS: The prevalences of hypotension and tachycardia were significantly reduced by 47.5% and 13.1%, respectively, after suppressing false incidents (P=0.01). Hypotension was particularly effective at predicting outcome favorability and mortality after artifact elimination (P=0.015 and 0.027, respectively). In addition, increased CPP was also statistically significant in predicting outcomes (P=0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of false incidents due to signal artifacts can be significantly reduced using machine-learning.

Yet, DAI assessment with highly sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques is unfeasible in the acute trauma setting, and computed tomography (CT) remains the key diagnostic modality despite its lower sensitivity. We sought to determine whether CT-defined hemorrhagic DAI (hDAI) is associated with discharge and favorable 3- and 12-month functional outcome (Glasgow Coma Scale score >=4) after msTBI., METHODS: We analyzed 361 msTBI patients from the single-center longitudinal Outcome Prognostication in Traumatic Brain Injury study collected over 6 years (November 2009 to November 2015) with prospective outcome assessments at 3 months and 12 months. Patients with microhemorrhages on CT were designated ""CT-hDAI-positive"" and those without as ""CT-hDAI-negative."" For secondary analyses ""CT-hDAI-positive"" was stratified into two phenotypes according to presence (""associated"") versus absence (""predominant"") of concomitant large acute traumatic lesions to determine whether presence versus absence of additional focal mass lesions portends a different prognosis., RESULTS: Seventy (19%) patients were CT-hDAI-positive (n = 36 predominant; n = 34 associated hDAI). In univariate analyses, CT-hDAI-positive status was associated with discharge survival (p = 0.004) and favorable outcome at 3 months (p = 0.003) and 12 months (p = 0.005). After multivariable adjustment, CT-hDAI positivity was no longer associated with discharge survival and functional outcome (all ps > 0.05). Stratified by hDAI phenotype, predominant hDAI patients had worse trauma severity, longer intensive care unit stays, and more systemic medical complications. Predominant hDAI, but not associated hDAI, was an independent predictor of discharge survival (adjusted odds ratio, 24.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-192.6; p = 0.002) and favorable 12-month outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5-15.2; p = 0.01).

A Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Recovery of Consciousness in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Preliminary Results.,"Yang, Ang; Xiao, Xue Hong; Liu, Zhong Hua; Wan, Zhi Long; Wang, Ze Yan","Accurate and reliable assessment of the conscious state of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is vital for their future management. The purpose of the present study is to find an effective and accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for predicting recovery of consciousness in patients with severe TBI.

The final outcome was the 1-year GOS, which was divided as follows: (1) dead/vegetative, (2) severely disabled (dependent patients), and (3) good/moderate recovery (independent patients). Patients were treated uniformly according to international protocols in a dedicated ICU. We considered patient characteristics that were previously identified as important predictors and could be determined easily and reliably. The admission years were divided into three intervals (1987-1995, 1996-2004, and 2005-2012), and the following individual CT characteristics were noted: the presence of traumatic subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage (tSAH, IVH), midline shift, cisternal status, and the volume of mass lesions (A x B x C/2). Ordinal logistic regression was performed to estimate associations between predictors and outcomes. The patients' estimated propensity scores were included as an independent variable in the ordinal logistic regression model (TWANG R package)., FINDINGS: The variables associated with the outcome were age, pupils, motor score, deterioration, shock, hypoxia, cistern status, IVH, tSAH, and epidural volume. When adjusting for those variables and the propensity score, we found a reduction in mortality from 55% (1987-1995) to 38% (2005-2012), but we discovered an increase in dependent patients from 10 to 21% and just a modest increase in independent patients of 6%., CONCLUSIONS: This study covers 25 years of management of sTBI in a single neurosurgical center.

Outcomes of emergency neurosurgical intervention in neuro-critical care patients with traumatic brain injury at Cork University Hospital.,"Amoo, Michael; O'Halloran, Philip J; Leo, Anne-Marie; O'Loughlin, Aoife; Mahon, Padraig; Lim, Chris","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability; the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in previously healthy people aged under 40 in the United Kingdom (UK). There are currently little official Irish statistics regarding TBI or outcome measures following TBI, although it is estimated that over 2000 people per year sustain TBI in Ireland. We performed a retrospective cohort study of TBI patients who were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) at CUH between July 2012 and December 2015. Demographic data were compiled by patients' charts reviews. Using the validated Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOS-E) outcome measure tool, we interviewed patients and/or their carers to measure functional outcomes. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to assess association between different variables using IBM's Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20. In the 42-month period, 102 patients were identified, mainly males (81%). 49% had severe TBI and 56% were referred from other hospitals. The mean age was 44.7 and a most of the patients were previously healthy, with 65% of patients having ASA I or II. Falls accounted for the majority of the TBI, especially amongst those aged over 50. The 30-day mortality was 25.5% and the mean length of hospital stay (LOS-H) was 33 days. 9.8% of the study population had a good recovery (GOS-E 8), while 7.8% had a GOS-E score of 3 (lower sever disability). Patients with Extra-Dural haemorrhage had better outcomes compared with those with SDH or multi-compartmental haemorrhages (p = 0.007). Older patients had a higher mortality, with the highest mortality (37.5%) among those over 50 years old (p = 0.009). TBI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the young mean age and low ASA the mortality, morbidity and average LOS-H were significant, highlighting the health and socioeconomic burden of TBI.",2018,/,British journal of neurosurgery,32,6,585-589,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2018.1522416,30394116,#5502,Amoo 2018,,yes
The factor structure of the Disability Rating Scale in individuals with traumatic brain injury.,"Krch, Denise; Lequerica, Anthony H","PURPOSE: To examine the factor structure of the Disability Rating Scale and the predictive validity of the scale's factors among individuals with traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and eight individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury were administered the Disability Rating Scale. The sample was randomly divided into two groups. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on Group 1, and a confirmatory factor analysis on Group 2. Regressions were performed to determine the predictive ability of the factors., RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis generated a three-factor structure, explaining 82.1% of the variance. Factor 1, comprising three disability items (feeding, toileting, and grooming), accounted for 58.4% of the variance. Factor 2, comprising three impairment items (eye opening, communication ability, and motor response), accounted for 14.8% of the variance. Factor 3, comprising two handicap items (level of functioning and employability), accounted for 8.9% of the variance. The three-factor solution was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. Regressions revealed the impairment factor at admission and the disability factor at discharge accounted for unique variance in predicting functional outcomes at one year post-injury., CONCLUSION: Each factor of the Disability Rating Scale may independently serve as a clinically useful outcome predictor after traumatic brain injury. Implications for rehabilitation The Disability Rating Scale is a measure used in brain injury rehabilitation that generates a total score indicating level of disability. This study confirmed a three-factor structure and showed that the individual factor scores provide unique information in predicting rehabilitation outcomes at one year post-injury.",2019,/,Disability and rehabilitation,41,1,98-103,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2017.1378388,28942681,#5455,Krch 2019,,yes
Accidental hypothermia as an independent risk factor of poor neurological outcome in older multiply injured patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a matched pair analysis.,"Winkelmann, M; Soechtig, W; Macke, C; Schroeter, C; Clausen, J D; Zeckey, C; Krettek, C; Mommsen, P","PURPOSE: Patients with multiple injuries are particularly susceptible to accidental hypothermia which is correlated with an increased risk of post-traumatic complications and mortality; however, its impact on neurological outcome in cases where there is concomitant traumatic brain injury is underexplored., METHODS: We analyzed severely injured patients (ISS >= 16) including a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (AISHead >= 3). The primary endpoint was objective neurological recovery, expressed as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at time of discharge. Secondary endpoints were mortality, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Statistical analysis included logistic regression (odds ratio). The significance level in all analyses was p = 0.05., RESULTS: We analyzed 278 patients (M age = 43 years, SD 19; M ISS = 32.8, SD 10.7). Mortality was 17% (n = 14). 102 patients (37%) were hypothermic on admission. Hypothermic patients were more severely injured (ISS 35.6 +/- 11.1 vs. 31.2 +/- 10.1, p = 0.001; APACHE II 18.1 +/- 7.4 vs. 16.2 +/- 7.3, p = 0.045) and had a higher transfusion requirement. Mortality rate in hypothermic patients was increased (23.5 vs. 13.1%, p = 0.03); however, hypothermia was not an independent predictor of mortality. Median GOS at discharge was 3 (IQR 3); in 47% of patients the outcome was favorable (GOS 4 or 5) and 36% it was poor (GOS 2 or 3). There were no differences in post-traumatic complications. Analysis of 73 matched pairs of hypothermic and normothermic patients could not prove hypothermia as an independent predictor of poor neurological outcome (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8-3.6, p = 0.1) in the total population. However, older patients (> 41 years) had a 4.2-times higher risk (95% CI 1.4-12.7; p = 0.01) of poor neurological outcome, if they were hypothermic on admission., CONCLUSIONS: Accidental hypothermia seems to have a negative impact on neurological recovery in older patients with multiple injuries including traumatic brain injury which outweighs potential benefits.",2019,/,European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,45,2,255-261,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00068-017-0897-0,29318345,#5450,Winkelmann 2019,,yes
Cognitive Reserve and Age Predict Cognitive Recovery after Mild to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Fraser, Elinor E; Downing, Marina G; Biernacki, Kathryn; McKenzie, Dean P; Ponsford, Jennie L","The persistence of injury-related cognitive impairments can have devastating consequences for everyday function after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This longitudinal study examined the association of long-term cognitive recovery in 109 adults (71% male) experiencing complicated mild-to-severe TBI with age, pre-morbid intelligence (IQ), and injury severity measured by post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration. Participants ' twice completed measures of pre-morbid IQ (National Adult Reading Test), attention (Digit Symbol Coding Test), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), and executive function (Trail Making Test Part-B) at a mean of 43.73 days post-TBI and again at a mean of 3.70 years (range 23-72 months) post-injury. A healthy control group comprising 63 adults (59% male) completed the measures once. At initial assessment, TBI participants performed significantly worse on all measures compared with the healthy control group. Within the TBI group, shorter PTA duration, younger age, and higher pre-morbid IQ were associated with better initial cognitive performance. Cognitive task performance improved significantly in the TBI group at follow-up between two to five years later but remained significantly below control group means. Notably, higher pre-morbid IQ and younger age were associated with greater cognitive recovery at follow-up, whereas PTA duration was not. These findings support the role of cognitive reserve and age in cognitive recovery after TBI and may inform prognostication and rehabilitation. Additional research is needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms of cognitive reserve in cognitive recovery after TBI.",2019,/,Journal of neurotrauma,36,19,2753-2761,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6430,31017049,#5200,Fraser 2019,,yes
Acute and Subacute Outcome Predictors in Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Monocentric Study.,"Gritti, Paolo; Zangari, Rosalia; Carobbio, Alessandra; Zucchi, Alberto; Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Ferri, Francesco; Agostinis, Cristina; Lanterna, Luigi Andrea; Brembilla, Carlo; Foresti, Camillo; Barbui, Tiziano; Biroli, Francesco","BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors affecting outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI), despite their importance, are still under discussion. The purpose of this study was to describe risk factors of in-hospital mortality and outcome at 1 year in a homogeneously treated population of patients with moderate/severe TBI., METHODS: A total of 193 consecutive patients with moderate or severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-3, including patients with initial GCS score of 13 at high risk for subsequent neurologic deterioration), admitted to the intensive care unit, were retrospectively analyzed. In-hospital mortality and unfavorable outcome at 1 year, based on a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score <=4, were considered as primary and secondary outcomes., RESULTS: At 1 year, unfavorable outcome occurred in 47.2%, including an in-hospital mortality of 19.7%. Increasing age, GCS motor score <3, coagulation disorders, and intracranial hypertension were acute risk factors of in-hospital mortality. In the 155 remaining survivors, Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS), posttraumatic cerebral infarction, cerebrospinal fluid disturbances, and length of intensive care unit stay were associated with unfavorable outcome at 1 year, in univariate analysis. A cutoff OHS score >=3 discriminated the probability of an unfavorable outcome (area under the curve, 0.87; P < 0.001; specificity, 74%; sensitivity, 84%). Combining the effect of acute and subacute variables in a multivariate analysis, increasing age and OHS score were independent predictors of outcome., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study confirmed age as the main acute risk factor and identified OHS as new potential subacute predictor of unfavorable outcome in moderate and severe TBI.

A Serum Protein Biomarker Panel Improves Outcome Prediction in Human Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Thelin, Eric; Al Nimer, Faiez; Frostell, Arvid; Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj; Nystrom, Harriet; Svensson, Mikael; Bellander, Bo-Michael; Piehl, Fredrik; Nelson, David W","Brain-enriched protein biomarkers of tissue fate are being introduced clinically to aid in traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. The aim of this study was to determine how concentrations of six different protein biomarkers, measured in samples collected during the first weeks after TBI, relate to injury severity and outcome. We included neurocritical care TBI patients that were prospectively enrolled from 2007 to 2013, all having one to three blood samples drawn during the first 2 weeks. The biomarkers analyzed were S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), tau, and neurofilament-light (NF-L). Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was assessed at 12 months. In total, 172 patients were included. All serum markers were associated with injury severity as classified on computed tomography scans at admission. Almost all biomarkers outperformed other known outcome predictors with higher levels the first 5 days, correlating with unfavorable outcomes, and UCH-L1 (0.260, pseduo-R2) displaying the best discrimination in univariate analyses. After adjusting for acknowledged TBI outcome predictors, GFAP and NF-L added most independent information to predict favorable/unfavorable GOS, improving the model from 0.38 to 0.51 pseudo-R2. A correlation matrix indicated substantial covariance, with the strongest correlation between UCH-L1, GFAP, and tau (r = 0.827-0.880). Additionally, the principal component analysis exhibited clustering of UCH-L1 and tau, as well as GFAP, S100B, and NSE, which was separate from NF-L.

Comparative study of computed tomographic scoring systems and predictors of early mortality in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Pargaonkar, Raghav; Kumar, Vinod; Menon, Girish; Hegde, Ajay","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant cause of disability, mortality and socio-economic loss in developing countries. Prognostication and early prediction of outcome will help in judicious allocation of resources. The three CT scoring systems, commonly employed in predicting outcome are the Marshall, Rotterdam and the Helsinki CT Scoring system. This is a prospective observational study to compare the above scoring systems and their role in predicting the outcome after TBI. A total of 157 patients were included in this study. Primary objective was early outcome assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale at discharge and 3months. On comparing the three CT scoring systems, the Helsinki CT score provided a better positive predictive value of 87.5% for mortality in comparison with Marshall (79.3%) and Rotterdam Score (82.5%). Summarising the results for ROC analysis of the three CT scoring systems, the area under curve was 0.742 for Marshall score, 0.751 for the Rotterdam score and 0.815 for the Helsinki score, which upholds the superiority of the Helsinki CT score in predicting the mortality compared to other two. The linear relationship of higher the score with added risk of mortality was seen with Rotterdam score and Helsinki score. Individual CT findings of positive midline shift, obliteration of suprasellar cisterns, presence of subarachnoid haemorrhage, intraventricular haemorrhage and large mass lesions were found to be independent predictors of mortality. The Helsinki Scoring system is a better prognostic model with significantly improved outcome prediction accuracy, although the Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems have good predictability for assessing mortality.

We assessed the influence of age on outcomes of patients with TBI and sought to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality of TBI among elderly patients., METHODS: Using a nationwide database, we analyzed data from 5651 patients with TBI. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare patient demographics, neurologic status on admission, radiologic findings, systemic complication rates, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and home discharge rates between elderly and nonelderly groups. Multivariable analysis was conducted to determine prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality among elderly patients., RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in elderly patients (12.8% vs. 19.3%; P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality of elderly patients with mild TBI increased significantly at >7 days after admission, whereas that of elderly patients with moderate or severe TBI was significantly higher immediately after admission.

In moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] scores 3-12), some CT features have been shown to be associated with outcomes. In mild TBI (mTBI; GCS scores 13-15), distribution and co-occurrence of pathological CT features and their prognostic importance are not well understood., Objective: To identify pathological CT features associated with adverse outcomes after mTBI., Design, Setting, and Participants: The longitudinal, observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study enrolled patients with TBI, including those 17 years and older with GCS scores of 13 to 15 who presented to emergency departments at 18 US level 1 trauma centers between February 26, 2014, and August 8, 2018, and underwent head CT imaging within 24 hours of TBI.

Contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma features were associated with incomplete recovery (odds ratios [ORs] for GOSE scores <8 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.39-2.33]; CENTER-TBI, 2.73 [95% CI, 2.18-3.41]) and greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes (ORs for GOSE scores <5 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 3.23 [95% CI, 1.59-6.58]; CENTER-TBI, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.13-2.49]) out to 12 months after injury, but epidural hematoma was not. Intraventricular and/or petechial hemorrhage was associated with greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes up to 12 months after injury (eg, OR for GOSE scores <5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: 3.47 [95% CI, 1.66-7.26]). Some CT features were more strongly associated with outcomes than previously validated variables (eg, ORs for GOSE scores <5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: neuropsychiatric history, 1.43 [95% CI .98-2.10] vs contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma, 3.23 [95% CI 1.59-6.58]). Findings were externally validated in 2594 patients with mTBI enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study., Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, pathological CT features carried different prognostic implications after mTBI to 1 year postinjury.

However, the effectiveness and prognosis of intensive treatment for geriatric TBI have not yet been determined. Thus, we used nationwide data from the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank (JNTDB) projects to analyze prognostic factors for intensive and aggressive treatments., METHODS: We analyzed 1,879 geriatric TBI cases (age >=65 years) registered in four JNTDB projects: Project 1998 (P1998) to Project 2015 (P2015). Clinical features, use of aggressive treatment, and 6-month outcomes on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were compared among study projects. Logistic regression was used to identify prognostic factors in aggressively treated patients., RESULTS: The percentage of geriatric TBI cases significantly increased with time-P1998: 30.1%; Project 2004 (P2004): 34.6%; Project 2009 (P2009): 43.9%; P2015: 53.6%, p<0.0001). Use of aggressive treatment also significantly increased, from 67.0% in P1998 to 69.3% in P2015 (p<0.0001). Less invasive methods, such as trepanation and normothermic targeted temperature management, were more often chosen for geriatric patients. These efforts resulted in a significant decrease in the 6-month mortality rate, from 76.2% in P1998 to 63.1% in P2015 (p=0.0003), although the percentage of severely disabled patients increased, from 8.9% in P1998 to 11.1% in P2015 (p=0.0003).

Serum Glucose-To-Potassium Ratio as a Prognostic Predictor for Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Shibata, Ami; Matano, Fumihiro; Saito, Nobuyuki; Fujiki, Yu; Matsumoto, Hisashi; Mizunari, Takayuki; Morita, Akio","BACKGROUND: Initial management of severe traumatic brain injury is important and includes treatment decision-making and prediction of prognosis. We examined whether biomarkers at admission could be useful prognostic predictors. We focused on electrolytes and blood glucose, which can be measured easily at any facility and for which results can be obtained promptly, before those of other biomarkers, such as D-dimer., METHODS: All trauma patients with head injuries treated at Chiba Hokusoh Hospital between 2014 and 2017 were investigated. Cases of multiple trauma accompanied by fatal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, or cardiopulmonary arrest, and pediatric cases, were excluded from this study. Blood gas data at the initial hospital visit were reviewed retrospectively. A poor outcome was defined as death during hospitalization or a vegetative state due to head injury. Factors related to poor outcomes were analyzed., RESULTS: Of the 185 male and 79 female patients studied, 34 had poor outcomes. Poor outcome was significantly correlated with potassium (P = 0.003), glucose (P < 0.001), and glucose-to-potassium ratio (P < 0.001) at arrival. The odds ratio was 4.079 for a glucose-to-potassium ratio of >=50., CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated blood gas data at the initial hospital visit, as these results can be obtained more quickly than those of other biomarkers assessed previously.

Traumatic axonal injury: is the prognostic information produced by conventional MRI and DTI complementary or supplementary?.,"Castano-Leon, Ana M; Cicuendez, Marta; Navarro-Main, Blanca; Paredes, Igor; Munarriz, Pablo M; Hilario, Amaya; Ramos, Ana; Gomez, Pedro A; Lagares, Alfonso","OBJECTIVE: A traumatic axonal injury (TAI) diagnosis has traditionally been based on conventional MRI, especially on those sequences with a higher sensitivity to edema and blood degradation products. A more recent technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can infer the microstructure of white matter (WM) due to the restricted diffusion of water in organized tissues. However, there is little information regarding the correlation of the findings obtained by both methods and their use for outcome prognosis. The main objectives of this study were threefold: 1) study the correlation between DTI metrics and conventional MRI findings; 2) evaluate whether the prognostic information provided by the two techniques is supplementary or complementary; and 3) determine the incremental value of the addition of these variables compared to a traditional prognostic model., METHODS: The authors studied 185 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who underwent MRI with DTI study during the subacute stage. The number and volume of lesions in hemispheric subcortical WM, corpus callosum (CC), basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem in at least four conventional MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, T2* gradient recalled echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging) were determined. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured in 28 WM bundles using the region of interest method. Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate the colocalization of macroscopic lesions and FA. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the independent prognostic value of each neuroimaging modality after adjustment for relevant clinical covariates, and the internal validation of the model was evaluated in a contemporary cohort of 92 patients., RESULTS: Differences in the lesion load between patients according to their severity and outcome were found. Colocalization of macroscopic nonhemorrhagic TAI lesions (not microbleeds) and lower FA was limited to the internal and external capsule, corona radiata, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, CC, and brainstem. However, a significant association between the FA value and the identification of macroscopic lesions in distant brain regions was also detected. Specifically, lower values of FA of some hemispheric WM bundles and the splenium of the CC were related to a higher number and volume of hyperintensities in the brainstem. The regression analysis revealed that age, motor score, hypoxia, FA of the genu of the CC, characterization of TAI lesions in the CC, and the presence of thalamic/basal ganglia lesions were independent prognostic factors. The performance of the proposed model was higher than that of the IMPACT (International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) model in the validation cohort., CONCLUSIONS: Very limited colocalization of hyperintensities (none for microbleeds) with FA values was discovered.

Sex-based differences in outcomes for adult patients presenting to the emergency department with a concussion.,"Rowe, Brian H; Yang, Esther H; Gaudet, Lindsay A; Eliyahu, Leeor; Junqueira, Daniela R; Beach, Jeremy; Mrazik, Martin; Cummings, Garnet; Voaklander, Donald","OBJECTIVE: Patients with concussion frequently present to the emergency department (ED). Studies of athletes and children indicate that concussion symptoms are often more severe and prolonged in females compared with males. Given infrequent study of concussion symptoms in the general adult population, the authors conducted a sex-based comparison of patients with concussion., METHODS: Adults (>= 17 years of age) presenting with concussion to one of three urban Canadian EDs were recruited. Discharged patients were contacted by telephone 30 and 90 days later to capture the extent of persistent postconcussion symptoms using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). A multivariate logistic regression model for persistent symptoms that included biological sex was developed., RESULTS: Overall, 250 patients were included; 131 (52%) were women, and the median age of women was significantly higher than that of men (40 vs 32 years). Women had higher RPQ scores at baseline (p < 0.001) and the 30-day follow-up (p = 0.001); this difference resolved by 90 days. The multivariate logistic regression identified that women, patients having a history of sleep disorder, and those presenting to the ED with concussions after a motor vehicle collision were more likely to experience persistent symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: In a community concussion sample, inconsequential demographic differences existed between adult women and men on ED presentation. Based on self-reported and objective outcomes, work and daily activities may be more affected by concussion and persistent postconcussion symptoms for women than men.

"Usability of the Level of the S100B Protein, the Gosling Pulsatility Index, and the Jugular Venous Oxygen Saturation for the Prediction of Mortality and Morbidity in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.","Tomasiuk, Ryszard; Dzierzecki, Sebastian; Zaczynski, Artur; Zabek, Miroslaw","The high frequency of traumatic brain injury imposes severe economic stress on health and insurance services. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between the serum S100B protein, the Gosling pulsatility index (PI), and the level of oxygen saturation at the tip of the internal jugular vein (SjVO2%) in patients diagnosed with severe TBI. The severity of TBI was assessed by a GCS score <= 8 stratified by Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) measured on the day of discharge from the hospital. Two groups were included: GOS < 4 (unfavorable group (UG)) and GOS >= 4 (favorable group (UG)). S100B levels were higher in the UG than in the FG. PI levels in the UG were also substantially higher than in the FG. There were similar levels of SjVO2 in the two groups. This study confirmed that serum S100B levels were higher in patients with unfavorable outcomes than in those with favorable outcomes. Moreover, a clear demarcation in PI between unfavorable and FGs was observed. This report shows that mortality and morbidity rates in patients with traumatic brain injury can be assessed within the first 4 days of hospitalization using the S100B protein, PI values, and SjVO2.

Analysis of Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of Traumatic Brain Injury in Papua New Guinea.,"Chen, Peng; Deng, Yongbing; Yu, Xing; Huang, Tao; Huang, Jingrui","Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of TBI patients from 2016 to 2019 admitted to Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and compare the results with previous researches to analyze current clinical characteristics and prognosis., Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 389 TBI patients in Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) over a 48-month period (from January 2016 to December 2019). The clinical and radiographic data were collected. Patients were followed up for at least 3 months, and outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to analyze the prognosis and intracranial infection of patients, as well as the effect of surgery on the prognosis of TBI patients., Results: The average age of the 389 TBI patients was 24.9 years old, and the most common age was 18-40 years old, accounting for 55.5%. The proportion of male patients was 79.4%, and the proportion of juvenile patients (<=18 years) was 30.8%. The most primary cause of injury was fighting and brawling (38.0%). At admission, patients had an average GCS score of 9.1, and patients with severe TBI accounted for 46.8%. Overall, 32.1% of the patients had a good prognosis, with a mortality rate of 13.9% (54 cases). Analyzing the relationship between surgical treatment and prognosis in 303 patients with moderate or severe TBI, there was no statistical significance. Univariate and logistic regression analyses for poor prognosis included gender, GCS, multiple injuries, Rotterdam CT scores, and intracranial infection. Univariate and logistic regression analyses for intracranial infection included GCS, open brain trauma, and postoperative drainage time., Conclusion: Despite there has been a secular trend towards reduced incidence of TBI, the prognosis of moderate or severe TBI patients who received surgery showed no significant improvement, indicating that PNG, as a backward developing country, faced a huge problem in TBI prevention and control.

Factors predicting early outcome in patients admitted at emergency department with severe head trauma,Imen R.B.; Olfa C.; Kamilia C.; Meriam B.; Hichem K.; Adel C.; Mabrouk B.; Noureddine R. ,"Abstract Objective To determine predictive factors of early mortality among severe traumatic brain injury in emergency department. Methods This study is based on a retrospective analysis of 198 admitted in emergency depatment with severe head injury (Glasgow coma scale score <=8) of an university hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). Basic demographic, clinical, biological and radiological data were recorded on admission and during emergency department stay. Results Forty two patients were died. Univariate analysis showed that the presence of shock, cardiac arrest, bilateral mydriasis, high value of injury severity score and low value of Glasgow coma scale were associated with mortality. Moreover, meningeal hemorrhage, cerebral and subdural haematoma were associated with poorer outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that factors associated with a poor prognosis were cardiac arrest cerebral and the presence of cerebral haematoma.

Contribution of brain or biological reserve and cognitive or neural reserve to outcome after TBI: A meta-analysis (prior to 2015),Mathias J.L.; Wheaton P. ,"Brain/biological (BR) and cognitive/neural reserve (CR) have increasingly been used to explain some of the variability that occurs as a consequence of normal ageing and neurological injuries or disease. However, research evaluating the impact of reserve on outcomes after adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) has yet to be quantitatively reviewed. This meta-analysis consolidated data from 90 studies (published prior to 2015) that either examined the relationship between measures of BR (genetics, age, sex) or CR (education, premorbid IQ) and outcomes after TBI or compared the outcomes of groups with high and low reserve. The evidence for genetic sources of reserve was limited and often contrary to prediction. APOE 4 status has been studied most, but did not have a consistent or sizeable impact on outcomes. The majority of studies found that younger age was associated with better outcomes, however most failed to adjust for normal age-related changes in cognitive performance that are independent of a TBI. This finding was reversed (older adults had better outcomes) in the small number of studies that provided age-adjusted scores; although it remains unclear whether differences in the cause and severity of injuries that are sustained by younger and older adults contributed to this finding. Despite being more likely to sustain a TBI, males have comparable outcomes to females. Overall, as is the case in the general population, higher levels of education and pre-morbid IQ are both associated with better outcomes.Copyright © 2015.",2015,/,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,55,"(Mathias, Wheaton) School of Psychology, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",573-593,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.06.001,604982908,#22942,Mathias 2015,,yes
Evaluation of white matter injury patterns underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury1,Alhilali L.M.; Delic J.A.; Gumus S.; Fakhran S. ,"Purpose: To determine if a central axonal injury underlies neuropsychiatric symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by using tract-based spatial statistics analysis of diffusion-tensor images. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this study, with waiver of informed consent. Diffusion-tensor imaging and serial neurocognitive testing with the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing evaluation were performed in 45 patients with mTBI (38 with irritability, 32 with depression, and 18 with anxiety). Control subjects consisted of 29 patients with mTBI without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps were analyzed by using tract-based spatial statistics with a multivariate general linear model. Diffusion-tensor imaging findings were correlated with symptom severity, neurocognitive test scores, and time to recovery with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Result(s): Compared with control subjects, patients with mTBI and depression had decreased fractional anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (P = .006), white matter around the nucleus accumbens (P = .03), and anterior limb of the internal capsule (P = .02). Patients with anxiety had diminished fractional anisotropy in the vermis (P = .04). No regions of significantly decreased fractional anisotropy were seen in patients with irritability relative to control subjects. Injury in the region of the nucleus accumbens inversely correlated with recovery time in patients with depression (r = 20.480, P = .005). Conclusion(s): Unique white matter injury patterns were seen for two major posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms. Injury to the cerebellar vermis in patients with mTBI and anxiety may indicate underlying dysfunction in primitive fear conditioning circuits in the cerebellum. Involvement of the nucleus accumbens in depression after mTBI may suggest an underlying dysfunctional reward circuit that affects the prognosis in these patients.Copyright © RSNA, 2015.",2015,/,Radiology,277,3,793-800,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015142974,607126316,#22938,Alhilali 2015,,yes
Total antioxidant capacity is associated with mortality of patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Lorente L.; Martin M.M.; Almeida T.; Abreu-Gonzalez P.; Ramos L.; Argueso M.; Riano-Ruiz M.; Sole-Violan J.; Jimenez A. ,"Background: Previously, circulating total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients has been scarcely studied and only in studies of small sample size (lower than 55 TBI patients). In one study were found higher serum TAC in non-survivor than in survivor TBI patients; however, an association between circulating TAC and mortality in patients with TBI has not been previously reported. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between circulating TAC, peroxidation state and mortality in patients with severe TBI. Method(s): This was a multicenter, observational and prospective study was carried out in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. We included patients with severe TBI defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lower than 9. We excluded patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) in non-cranial aspects higher than 9. We measured serum TAC on day 1 of TBI. The 30-day mortality was established as endpoint. Result(s): Non-surviving TBI patients (N = 27) showed higher serum TAC (P < 0.001) than survivor ones (N = 73). Logistic regression analyses showed that serum TAC higher than 2.59 nmol/mL were associated with 30-day mortality controlling for APACHE-II and CT classification (OR = 4.40; 95 % CI = 1.14-16.98; P = 0.03), controlling for GCS and age (OR = 5.88; 95 % CI = 1.57-22.06; P = 0.009), and controlling for CT classification and admission abnormal pupils (OR = 3.89; 95 % CI = 1.30-11.61; P = 0.02). There was an association between serum TAC and malondialdehyde (a biomarker of lipid peroxidation) levels (rho = 0.25; p = 0.01), APACHE-II score (rho = 0.23; p = 0.03) and GCS (rho = -0.21; p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, our series is the largest reporting data on circulating TAC in patients with severe TBI. The most relevant and new findings of our study were that there is an association between circulating TAC and peroxidation state and mortality in patients with severe TBI.Copyright © 2015 Lorente et al.",2015,/,BMC Neurology,15,1,115,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12883-015-0378-1,605272242,#22934,Lorente 2015,,yes
Validation of the revised injury severity classification score in patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury,Raj R.; Brinck T.; Skrifvars M.B.; Kivisaari R.; Siironen J.; Lefering R.; Handolin L. ,"Introduction By analysing risk-Adjusted mortality ratios, weaknesses in the process of care might be identified. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the main cause of death in trauma, and thus it is crucial that trauma prediction models are valid for TBI patients. Accordingly, we assessed the validity of the RISC score in TBI patients by internal and external validation analyses. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe TBI admitted to the TraumaRegister DGU (TR-DGU) and the trauma registry of Helsinki University Hospital (TR-THEL) in 2006-2011 were included in this retrospective open cohort study. Definition of moderate-to-severe TBI was head abbreviated injury scale of 3 or higher. Subgroup analysis for patients with isolated and polytrauma TBI was performed. The performance of the RISC score was evaluated by assessing its discrimination (area under the curve, AUC) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow [H-L] test). Results Among the 9106 and 809 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI admitted to TR-DGU and TR-THEL, unadjusted mortality was 26% and 23%, respectively. Internal and external validation of the RISC score showed good discrimination (TR-DGU AUC 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.90 and TR-THEL AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81-0.87), but poor calibration (p < 0.001) in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Subgroup analysis found the discrimination only to be modest in isolated TBI (AUC 0.76) and calibration to be particularly poor in polytrauma TBI (TR-DGU H-L = 4356, p < 0.001; TR-THEL H-L 112, p < 0.001). Conclusion The RISC score was found to be of limited predictive value in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. A new general trauma scoring system that includes TBI specific prognostic factors is warranted.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute inflammatory biomarker profiles predict depression risk following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury,Juengst S.B.; Kumar R.G.; Failla M.D.; Goyal A.; Wagner A.K. ,"Objective: To examine whether acute inflammation profiles predict posttraumatic depression (PTD) risk 6 and 12 months after traumatic brain injury. Setting(s): University-affiliated level 1 trauma center and community. Participant(s): Adults with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (acute serum levels: n = 50; acute cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels: n = 41). Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Main Measures: Patient Health Questionnaire; inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha, soluble vascular adhesion molecule [sVCAM-1], soluble intracellular adhesion molecule [sICAM-1], soluble Fas [sFAS]). Result(s): Higher levels of acute CSF cytokine surface markers (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, and sFAS) in an inflammatory biomarker risk (IBR) score were associated with a 3.920-fold increase in the odds of developing PTD at 6 months (95% confidence interval: 1.163-8.672). Having sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, or sFAS above the 75th percentile had a positive predictive value of 85.7% for PTD risk at 6 months. An IBR score including inflammatory biomarkers IL-7 and IL-8 showed a trending association with 12-month PTD risk (odds ratio = 3.166, 95% confidence interval: 0.936- 10.708). Conclusion(s): Acute CSF IBR scores show promise for identifying individuals at risk for PTD. Further research should assess acute CSF inflammatory biomarkers' relationships to chronic inflammation as a mechanism of PTD and should explore anti-inflammatory treatments for PTD, as well as prevention and screening protocols, and link inflammatory biomarkers to symptom tracking.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The objective of this study was to determine if the proportion of time and area under the hemoglobin-time curve of >=90 g/L are independently associated with 6-month functional outcomes. Method(s): Retrospective cohort study of 116 patients with a severe TBI who underwent invasive neuromonitoring between June 2006 and December 2013. Hemoglobin area (HAI) and time (HTI) indices were calculated by dividing the total area, or time, under the hemoglobin-time curve at 90 g/L or above by the total duration of monitoring. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to model the association between HAI or HTI and 6 month favorable neurologic outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score 4 or 5). Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 38 years (SD 16) with a median admission Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 (IQR 4-7). There were 1523 hemoglobin measurements and 523 monitoring days. Patients had a hemoglobin >=90 g/L for a median of 70 % (IQR 37-100) of the time. Each 10 g/L increase in HAI (RR 1.23, 95 %CI 1.04-1.44, P = 0.011), and 10 % increase in HTI (1.10, 95 %CI 1.04-1.16, P < 0.001) were associated with improved neurologic outcome.

Hyperglycemia is a predictor of prognosis in traumatic brain injury: Tertiary intensive care unit study,Terzioglu B.; Ekinci O.; Berkman Z. ,"Background: Hyperglycemia is frequently encountered in critically ill patients and has been shown to contribute to both morbidity and mortality. We aimed to study the predictive role of blood glucose level in clinical outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients with traumatic brain injury during intensive care unit (ICU) stay and to explore its relationship with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and acute physiology and chronic health examination (APACHE) II scores that are used in the evaluation of ICU patients as predictor. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 185 patients with craniocerebral trauma who were hospitalized in the ICU were included in the study. Comparisons of mean glucose values (MGVs) and APACHE II scores between survivors and nonsurvivors were made with Student's t-test and chi-square test. Survival analysis was performed with log rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox regression was used for mortality risk factors analysis. Result(s): MGVs at the initial, last, and all measurements were significantly higher for nonsurvivors than for survivors. Hazard rate at any given time point for patients with mean glucose value (MGV) between 150 and 179 was found to be 3.691 times that of patients with MGV values between 110 and 149. The hazard rate at any given time point for patients with MGV values >=180 was found to be 6.571 times that of patients with MGV values between 110 and 149.

Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-one adult patients with TBI-induced coma, assessed according to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores on admission, were divided into very severe injury, severe injury and moderate injury groups. Thirty-one adult healthy volunteers were selected as the control group. Blood samples were collected twice at day 1, day 3 and day 7 after admission. The prognosis of these patients was evaluated 3 months after TBI. Result(s): The serum MLT levels of each TBI group at each time point were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). The MLT levels of very severe and severe TBI groups were significantly lower than those of the moderate TBI group (p < 0.05). The MLT level of the very severe group was significantly lower than that of the severe group (p < 0.05). The lower the serum MLT level, the more severe was the condition of TBI (by GCS scoring), and the lower were the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. Conclusion(s): Lower serum MLT levels may indicate worse condition, and serum melatonin levels may correlate with the severity and prognosis of patients with TBI.",2015,/,Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia,10,04-Mar,91-94,,,608318299,#22852,Qiu 2015,,yes

Relationship of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Postconcussion Recovery in Youth Athletes,Mautner K.; Sussman W.I.; Axtman M.; Al-Farsi Y.; Al-Adawi S. ,"Objective: To investigate whether attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) influences postconcussion recovery, as measured by computerized neurocognitive testing. Design(s): This is a retrospective case control study. Setting(s): Computer laboratories across 10 high schools in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. Participant(s): Immediate postconcussion assessment and cognitive testing (ImPACT) scores of 70 athletes with a self-reported diagnosis of ADHD and who sustained a sport-related concussion were compared with a randomly selected age-matched control group. Immediate postconcussion assessment and cognitive testing scores over a 5-year interval were reviewed for inclusion. Main Outcome Measure(s): Postconcussion recovery was defined as a return to equivalent baseline neurocognitive score on the ImPACT battery, and a concussion symptom score of <=7. Result(s): Athletes with ADHD had on average a longer time to recovery when compared with the control group (16.5 days compared with 13.5 days), although not statistically significant. The number of previous concussions did not have any effect on the rate of recovery in the ADHD or the control group. In addition, baseline neurocognitive testing did not statistically differ between the 2 groups, except in verbal memory. Conclusion(s): Although not statistically significant, youth athletes with ADHD took on average 3 days longer to return to baseline neurocognitive testing compared with a control group without ADHD. Clinical Relevance: Youth athletes with ADHD may have a marginally prolonged recovery as indexed by neurocognitive testing and should be considered when prognosticating time to recovery in this subset of student athletes.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The circadian intracranial pressure would be a prognostic factor in traumatic brain injury?,Li X.; Guan J.; Hou W.; Cheng S.; Jiang Z.; Wang Y.; Liu Y.; Wang Z. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) generally influences circadian rhythms and has been implicated changes in circadian rhythm. Whether TBI-induced changes in circadian rhythm may affect the prognosis or recovery from TBI remains to be investigated. Sixty-two patients with TBI were continuously monitored for intracranial pressure (ICP) during the first 24 hours after the implantation of ICP monitor. The data from each patient were analyzed using the least squares fit of a 24-h cosine function by single cosinor method. Parameters of circadian A (Amplitude)/M (MESOR) were used to evaluate the circadian rhythm of the patients. Student's t-test and Pearson's chi-squared test were utilized to analyze the differences between good prognosis group and poor prognosis. A linear regression analysis was then applied to calculate the correlation between circadian A/M of ICP and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) before discharge, the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), the dosage of mannitol, and time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU), respectively. The results demonstrated that circadian A/M of patients' ICP exhibited a positive correlation with GCS scores taken before discharge, GOS-E scores, and was negatively correlated with the amount of mannitol, and time spent in the ICU. We conclude that changes in the ICP circadian rhythm in TBI patients could reflect an internal signal of brain damage and, therefore, may be useful to predict a patient's prognosis and recovery from TBI.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2016,/,Biological Rhythm Research,47,6,823-832,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2016.1197515,610906200,#22744,Li 2016,,yes
Validation of CRASH model in prediction of 14-day mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome of head trauma patients,Hashemi B.; Amanat M.; Baratloo A.; Forouzanfar M.M.; Rahmati F.; Motamedi M.; Safari S. ,"Introduction: To date, many prognostic models have been proposed to predict the outcome of patients with traumatic brain injuries. External validation of these models in different populations is of great importance for their generalization. The present study was designed, aiming to determine the value of CRASH prognostic model in prediction of 14-day mortality (14-DM) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (6-MUO) of patients with traumatic brain injury. Method(s): In the present prospective diagnostic test study, calibration and discrimination of CRASH model were evaluated in head trauma patients referred to the emergency department. Variables required for calculating CRASH expected risks (ER), and observed 14-DM and 6-MUO were gathered. Then ER of 14-DM and 6-MUO were calculated. The patients were followed for 6 months and their 14-DM and 6-MUO were recorded. Finally, the correlation of CRASH ER and the observed outcome of the patients was evaluated. The data were analyzed using STATA version 11.0. Result(s): In this study, 323 patients with the mean age of 34.0 As 19.4 years were evaluated (87.3% male). Calibration of the basic and CT models in prediction of 14-day and 6-month outcome were in the desirable range (P < 0.05). Area under the curve in the basic model for predic tion of 14-DM and 6-MUO were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.96) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95), respectively. In addition, area under the curve in the CT model for prediction of 14-DM and 6-MUO were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.97) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.96), respectively. There was no significant difference between the discriminations of the two models in prediction of 14-DM (p = 0.11) and 6-MUO (p = 0.1). Conclusion(s): The results of the present study showed that CRASH prediction model has proper discrimination and calibration in predicting 14-DM and 6-MUO of head trauma patients. Since there was no difference between the values of the basic and CT models, using the basic model is recommended to simplify the risk calculations.Copyright © 2016 Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.",2016,/,Emergency,4,4,196-201,,,613412597,#22736,Hashemi 2016,,yes
Factors affecting mortality in geriatric patients with head trauma,Icer M.; Sen A.; Zengin Y.; Dursun R.; Durgun H.M.; Ustundag M.; Orak M.; Guloglu C. ,"Introduction: With aging, the anatomy and physiology of the body undergo changes. This leads to a change in the body's capabilities in response to trauma, resulting in increased traumainduced morbidity and mortality. We aimed to investigate the factors influencing the prognosis and mortality of geriatric patients with head trauma. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 1060 patients aged 65 and above who presented with head trauma within a three-year period were studied. The patients' collected data included gender, age, trauma presentation, Glasgow Coma Scale, Revised Trauma Score, cranial physical examination findings, localisation of the fracture in the cranial regions, cranial pathology, additional organ injury and survival/death status. Result(s): Of the 1060 geriatric patients enrolled in the study, 500 (47%) were male and 560 (53%) were female. Of these patients, 1005 (94.8%) survived and 55 (5.20%) died. Among the deceased patients, 37 (37.3%) were male and 18 (32.7%) were female. The most common presentation was observed in the young old group (aged 65-75) with 513 patients. According to the causes of trauma, the most common cause was due to falling. The male gender was found to be at risk of mortality in all patients aged 65 and above. According to the computed tomography findings; intracranial haemorrhage, contusion, subarachnoid haemorrhage, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma and intracranial edema were factors associated with increased mortality. Conclusion(s): Males and cranial pathologies are associated with a higher mortality in geriatric patients with head trauma.Copyright © 2016, Geriatrics Society.

Severe brain injuries: Epidemiology and outcome in a Tunisian medical intensive care unit,Ghezala H.B.; Snouda S.; Daoudi R.; Kaddour M. ,"Introduction Severe brain injuries are most often due to road traffic accidents and usually occur in young persons. Despite the progress made, their management remains dependent on the availability of resources. In this study, we tried to establish the profile of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the teaching department of intensive care unit of the regional hospital of Zaghouan and compare it to the literature. Then, we tried to determine outcome factors. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective study over 04 years from 2011 to 2014. We enrolled all adult patients admitted to intensive care via emergency following a cranial trauma with GCS <=8 after normalization of hemodynamic status. We excluded from the results analysis patient records with insufficient clinical or para-clinical data. Results During the study period, 132 patients admitted for TBI were collected representing 3 % of all admissions and 12 % of all head trauma hospitalized in the unit. The most common mechanism was the road traffic accident (78 % of cases). All transport was non-medicalized. So there was no intubation-ventilation at the site of trauma. The takeover delay was 78 min. The average age of patients was 43 +/- 16 years with extremes ranging from 19 to 83 years. The sex ratio was 4.3. The state of consciousness was evaluated by the GCS with an average of 5 +/- 2. Sixty-six percent of patients had a pupillary anomaly, 19 % had a neurological deficit, and 81 % had associated lesions. The most frequent CT lesions were subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral contusions. All patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation with an average duration of hospitalization of 9 +/- 2 days. The prognosis, assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), was correlated with several factors. The takeover delay (p < 0.02), the GCS (p < 0.01), the presence of pupillary anomaly (p < 0.01), the presence of associated lesions (p = 0.01), the ISS score (p < 0.01) and the CT scan score (p < 0.01) were considered as outcome indicators in univariate analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a correlation between the age, the takeover delay and the outcome of the patients. Correlation with secondary systemic insults was not established in our study. Multivariate analysis showed a correlation between the Glasgow coma scale and mortality. Conclusion The profile of TBI in ICU of Zaghouan is similar to data in recent literature. The prognostic factors identified in our study were: the mean delay of management, the GCS, the presence of pupillary anomalies, the presence of associated injuries, the ISS and the CT score. In order to improve the outcome of TBI, we need to use multimodal monitoring.",2016,/,Annals of Intensive Care,6,SUPPL. 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-016-0114-z,72342667,#22673,Ghezala 2016,,yes
Effects of acute blood alcohol level on consciousness and 6-month recovery after mild traumatic brain injury: A track-TBI study,Yue J.; Satris G.; Winkler E.; Robinson C.; Upadhyayula P.; Lingsma H.; Korley F.; Nielson J.; Ngwenya L.; Ferguson A.; Vassar M.; Yuh E.; Mukherjee P.; Gordon W.; Valadka A.; Okonkwo D.; Manley G. ,"Over 20% of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients experience persistent impairment at 6-months, which may be complicated by patterns of excessive alcohol use. Blunt mTBI patients without acute intracranial pathology from the TRACK-TBI Pilot study with emergency department (ED) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13-15 and recorded blood alcohol level (BAL) were extracted (100-mg/dl as proxy for excessive use (> U.S. legal limit 80-mg/dl)). Multivariable regression was performed for patients with 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE, n = 67) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Processing Speed Index Composite Score (WAIS-PSI, n = 58), adjusting for age, education, psychiatric history, GCS, loss-ofconsciousness (LOC). Overall, 107 patients aged 42.7 +/- 16.8-years, 67.3%-male, and 80.4%-Caucasian were included; 65.4% had zero BAL, 5.6% BAL < 100-mg/dl, and 29.0% BAL >= 100-mg/dl (range 100-440). Injury mechanisms included falls-47.7%, motor vehicle-24.3%, pedestrian/cyclist-16.8%, and assault-9.3%. Most patients experienced LOC (49.5%-yes, 26.2%-unknown) and amnesia (65.1%-yes, 17.8%-unknown); 65.5% had GCS = 15. BAL differed across LOC (none: [median 0/IQR 0-0], < 30 min: [0/0-43], >= 30 min: [224/ 50-269], unknown: [108/0-232]; p = 0.002) but not amnesia (p = 0.062). GCS < 15 associated with higher BAL ([19/0-204]-vs.-[0/0-20]; p = 0.013). BAL did not differ for psychiatric history or admission destination. On univariate analysis, BAL >= 100-mg/dl associated with less-than-full-recovery (GOSE <= 7; 38.1%-vs.-11.5%; p = 0.025) and lower WAIS-PSI (92.4 +/- 12.7/30th-percentile; 105.1 +/- 11.7/63rd-percentile; p < 0.001).

"Relationships among slowed processing speed, emotional reactivity, and postconcussive symptoms in adults with mild traumatic brain injury",Ellois V.; Long C.; Childs A.; Smith J.; Amorapanth P.X.; Bertisch H.; Lui Y.; Rath J.F. ,"Research Objectives: Processing speed (PS) deficits are among the most common neuropsychological (NP) deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These objective deficits may lead to subjective feelings of being flooded and overwhelmed or that things happen too quickly that one can no longer keep up with cognitive demands made by external events. This subjective experience of slowed PS has been proposed to underlie symptoms of emotional reactivity (ER), such as, tension, frustration, and irritability, which in turn may exacerbate cognitive complaints. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of objective PS deficits in ER and cognitive/somatic postconcussive symptoms (PCS) following mild TBI (mTBI). Design(s): Correlational/regression analyses examining objective PS measures, ER, and somatic/cognitive PCS. Setting(s): Large academic medical center. Participant(s): Adults with mTBI (n = 31), 52% female, primarily White (74%), average age of 35.8, with 16.1 years of education. Intervention(s): N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Standard TBI outcome battery, 6,7 addressing (a) objective NP impairments, (b) psychological status, and (c) PCS. ER was assessed using z-score composite of relevant self-report items. Result(s): Objective PS measures were significantly related to ER.

Conclusion(s): ER is directly related to objective PS deficits. In addition, ER is a significant predictor of somatic/cognitive PCS, whereas objective PS measures are not directly related to PCS. Emotional reactions to the experience of objective cognitive slowing warrant further investigation as a predictor of those at risk for prolonged PCS. Further examination of ER as a predictor of PCS may lead to more accurate assessment/prognosis following mTBI.",2016,/,Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,97,10,e112,,,612945297,#22659,Ellois 2016,,yes
Serum CXC chemokine ligand-12 as a potential predictor for in-hospital major adverse events after severe traumatic brain injury,Shen L.-J.; Zhou J.; Yang C.-S.; Lv Q.-W.; Xu Q.-C. ,"Background: CXC chemokine ligand-12 (CXCL12) is associated with brain inflammation. We attempted to discern whether serum CXCL12 is a promising predictor for in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), including death, acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction. Method(s): In this prospective, observational study, serum CXCL12 levels were quantified among 117 severe TBI patients. We investigated the relation of CXCL12 levels to IMAEs using a multivariate analysis. Result(s): Median value of serum CXCL12 concentrations was substantially higher in patients with IMAEs than in other remainders (21.1 vs. 11.6 ng/ml). With an increasing number of IMAEs, serum CXCL12 concentrations were significantly increased (r = 0.702). Serum CXCL12 independently predicted IMAEs (odds ratio, 1.253; 95% CI, 1.100-1.428). Serum CXCL12 concentrations discriminated risk of IMAEs with area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.759 (95% CI, 0.672-0.834), its concentrations >16.0 ng/ml distinguished IMAEs with 83.9% sensitivity and 67.2% specificity and its combination with Glasgow coma scale scores produced the best predictive ability compared with each one alone (p = 0.0116 or 0.0004).

Characterizing genetic risk factors of seizures following traumatic brain injury,Disanto D.; Kumar R.; Linsenmeyer M.; Conley Y.; Oleksak B.; Schratz M.; Shanley L.; Gilbert N.; Levochkina M.; Wagner A. ,"Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) occur in an estimated 20% of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Individuals with PTS are 37 times more likely to die as a result of seizures compared to the general population. Risk factors of PTS include craniotomy, craniectomy, and subdural hematoma (SDH). Our work has previously identified relationships between PTS and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to genetic variation of glutamatergic, GABAergic transport, and interleukin 1s. In a cohort of n = 209 adults with moderate-to-severe TBI, we created a gene risk score (GRS) using 6 SNPs (GRS6, n = 203) and in a subset of 4 SNPs (GRS4, n= 209), as aggregate measures of genetic risk. The sum of risk alleles carried by each individuals established an individual's unweighted GRS (uGRS). We assigned weights for each SNP using s-values from logistic regression models for each SNP to PTS, calculating weighted GRS (wGRS) by summing weights for risk alleles. We tested relationships between uGRS and wGRS with one-year PTS events via logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, and clinical covariates. Both uGRS (uGRS4 OR = 1.43, p = 0.071; uGRS6 OR = 8.39, p = 0.008) and wGRS (wGRS4 OR = 8.39, p = 0.001; wGRS6 OR = 6.09, p < 0.001) predicted PTS risk. We compared receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves of base regression models, including covariates alone, to models including GRS. wGRS improved area under the base model ROC curve, with final variance capture >0.83, indicating strong PTS status discrimination.

Systemic Estrone Production and Injury-Induced Sex Hormone Steroidogenesis after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Prognostic Indicator of Traumatic Brain Injury-Related Mortality.,"Rakholia, Milap V; Kumar, Raj G; Oh, Byung-Mo; Ranganathan, Prerna R; Berga, Sarah L; Kochanek, Patrick M; Wagner, Amy K","Extensive pre-clinical studies suggest that sex steroids are neuroprotective in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, clinical trials involving sex hormone administration have not shown beneficial results, and our observational cohort studies show systemic estradiol (E2) production to be associated with adverse outcomes. Systemic E2 is produced via aromatization of testosterone (T) or reduction of estrone (E1). E1, also produced via aromatization of androstenedione (Andro) and is a marker of T-independent E2 production. We hypothesized that E1 would be (1) associated with TBI-related mortality, (2) the primary intermediate for E2 production, and (3) associated with adipose tissue-specific aromatase transcription. We assessed 100 subjects with severe TBI and 8 healthy controls. Serum levels were measured on days 0-3 post-TBI for key steroidogenic precursors (progesterone), aromatase pathway intermediates (E1, E2, T, Andro), and the adipose tissue-specific aromatase transcription factors cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). E1 was elevated after TBI versus controls. High E1 was associated with higher progesterone, cortisol, and IL-6 (p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that those in the highest E1 tertile had increased odds for mortality (adjusted OR = 5.656, 95% CI = 1.102-29.045, p = 0.038). Structural equation models show that early serum E2 production is largely T independent, occurring predominantly through E1 metabolism. Acute serum E1 functions as a mortality marker for TBI through aromatase-dependent E1 production and T-independent E2 production. Further work should evaluate risk factors for high E2 production and how systemic E2 and its key intermediate E1 contribute to the extracerebral consequences of severe TBI.",2019,/,Journal of neurotrauma,36,7,1156-1167,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5782,29947289,#5438,Rakholia 2019,,yes
Estradiol to Androstenedione Ratios Moderate the Relationship between Neurological Injury Severity and Mortality Risk after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Ranganathan, Prerna; Kumar, Raj G; Oh, Byung-Mo; Rakholia, Milap V; Berga, Sarah L; Wagner, Amy K","Early declines in gonadotropin production, despite elevated serum estradiol, among some individuals with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) suggests amplified systemic aromatization occurs post-injury. Our previous work identifies estradiol (E2) as a potent mortality marker. Androstenedione (A), a metabolic precursor to E2, estrone (E1), and testosterone (T), is a steroid hormone substrate for aromatization that has not been explored previously as a biomarker in TBI. Here, we evaluated serum A, E1, T, and E2 values for 82 subjects with severe TBI. Daily hormone values were calculated, and E2:A and E1:T ratios were generated and then averaged for days 0-3 post-injury. After data inspection, mean E2:A values were categorized as above (high aromatization) and below (low aromatization) the 50th percentile for 30-day mortality assessment using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for age, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to predict 30-day mortality status. Daily serum T, E1, and E2 were graphed by E2:A category. Serum E1 and E2 significantly differed over time (p < 0.05); the high aromatization group had elevated levels and a significantly lower probability of survival within the first 30 days (p = 0.0274). Multivariable Cox regression showed a significant E2:A*GCS interaction (p = 0.0129), wherein GCS predicted mortality only among those in the low aromatization group. E2:A may be a useful mortality biomarker representing enhanced aromatization after TBI. E2:A ratios may represent non-neurological organ dysfunction after TBI and may be useful in defining injury subgroups in which GCS has variable capacity to serve as an accurate early prognostic marker.",2019,/,Journal of neurotrauma,36,4,538-547,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5677,30014751,#5435,Ranganathan 2019,,yes
Longitudinal Resting State Functional Connectivity Predicts Clinical Outcome in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Madhavan, Radhika; Joel, Suresh E; Mullick, Rakesh; Cogsil, Taylor; Niogi, Sumit N; Tsiouris, A John; Mukherjee, Pratik; Masdeu, Joseph C; Marinelli, Luca; Shetty, Teena","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects about 42 million people worldwide. It is often associated with headache, cognitive deficits, and balance difficulties but rarely shows any abnormalities on conventional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although in most mTBI patients the symptoms resolve within 3 months, 10-15% of patients continue to exhibit symptoms beyond a year. Also, it is known that there exists a vulnerable period post-injury, when a second injury may exacerbate clinical prognosis. Identifying this vulnerable period may be critical for patient outcome, but very little is known about the neural underpinnings of mTBI and its recovery. In this work, we used advanced functional neuroimaging to study longitudinal changes in functional organization of the brain during the 3-month recovery period post-mTBI. Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) measured from resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was found to be associated with symptom severity score (SSS, r = -0.28, p = 0.002). Decreased fALFF was observed in specific functional networks for patients with higher SSS, and fALFF returned to higher values when the patient recovered (lower SSS). In addition, functional connectivity of the same networks was found to be associated with concurrent SSS, and connectivity immediately after injury (<10 days) was capable of predicting SSS at a later time-point (3 weeks to 3 months, p < 0.05).

Early cognitive impairment is common after intracranial hemorrhage with mild traumatic brain injury.,"Delaplain, Patrick T; Albertson, Spencer; Grigorian, Areg; Williams, Barbara; Smith, Megan; Inaba, Kenji; Lekawa, Michael; Nahmias, Jeffry","BACKDROP: The incidence of early cognitive impairment (ECI) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown. We hypothesized ECI is common and can be predicted based on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Brain Injury Guideline (BIG) category., METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review of adult trauma patients (2014-2016) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and mild TBI (GCS score, 13-15) was performed. The primary outcome was ECI, defined as a Rancho Los Amigos score less than 8. Routine cognitive evaluation is performed on all ICH patients at our institution. Comparisons between ECI and no-ECI groups regarding demographic, cognitive, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using bivariate statistics. The odds of ECI were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: There were 465 patients with mild TBI, 70.3% were male, and the average age was 53 +/- 23 years. The most common mechanism of injury was fall (41.1%) followed by motor vehicle collision (15.9%). The incidence of ECI was 51.4% (n = 239). The incidence in patients with a GCS score of 15 was 42.9%, and BIG 1 category was 42.7%. There were no differences in demographics (age, sex, comorbidities), mechanism of injury, or imaging when comparing ECI patients with no-ECI patients. The GCS score was lower in the ECI group (14.4 vs. 14.7, p < 0.001). Patients with ECI were also less likely to be discharged home (58.2% vs. 78.3%, p < 0.001). Lower GCS-verbal, BIG category 3, and presence of pelvic/extremity fractures were strong risk factors for ECI in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, loss of consciousness, anticoagulants, narcotic administration, and Rotterdam score., CONCLUSION: Half of all patients with ICH and mild TBI had ECI. Both lower initial GCS score and BIG category 3 were associated with increased likelihood of ECI. Therefore, we recommend all patients with ICH and mild TBI undergo cognitive evaluation., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Study, Level III.",2020,/,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,89,1,215-221,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0000000000002641,32102043,#4807,Delaplain 2020,,yes
Occurrence and prognostic effect of cervical spine injuries and cervical artery injuries with concomitant severe head injury.,"Vehvilainen, Juho; Brinck, Tuomas; Lindfors, Matias; Numminen, Jussi; Siironen, Jari; Raj, Rahul","BACKGROUND: Blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) and cervical spinal injuries (CSIs) are not uncommon injuries in patients with severe head injury and may affect patient recovery. We aimed to assess the independent relationship between BCVI, CSI, and outcome in patients with severe head injury., METHODS: We identified patients with severe head injury from the Helsinki Trauma Registry treated during 2015-2017 in a large level 1 trauma hospital. We assessed the association between BCVI and SCI using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for injury severity. Our primary outcome was functional outcome at 6 months, and our secondary outcome was 6-month mortality., RESULTS: Of 255 patients with a cervical spine CT, 26 patients (10%) had a CSI, and of 194 patients with cervical CT angiography, 16 patients (8%) had a BCVI. Four of the 16 BCVI patients had a BCVI-related brain infarction, and four of the CSI patients had some form of spinal cord injury. After adjusting for injury severity in multivariable logistic regression analysis, BCVI associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0, 95% CI [confidence intervals] = 1.4-26.5) and mortality (OR = 7.9, 95% CI 2.0-31.4). We did not find any association between CSI and outcome., CONCLUSIONS: We found that BCVI with concomitant head injury was an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with severe head injury, but we found no association between CSI and outcome after severe head injury.

Biomarkers in traumatic brain injury: new concepts.,"Slavoaca, Dana; Muresanu, Dafin; Birle, Codruta; Rosu, Olivia Verisezan; Chirila, Ioana; Dobra, Iulia; Jemna, Nicoleta; Strilciuc, Stefan; Vos, Pieter","Traumatic brain injury is a multifaceted condition that encompasses a spectrum of injuries: contusions, axonal injuries in specific brain regions, edema, and hemorrhage. Brain injury determines a broad clinical and disability spectrum due to the implication of various cellular pathways, genetic phenotypes, and environmental factors. It is challenging to predict patient outcomes, to appropriately evaluate the patients, to determine a suitable treatment strategy and rehabilitation program, and to communicate with patient relatives. Biomarkers detected from body fluids are potential evaluation tools for traumatic brain injury patients. These may serve as internal indicators of cerebral damage, delivering valuable information about the dynamic cellular, biochemical, and molecular environments. The diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers tested both in animal models of traumatic brain injury is still under question, despite a considerable scientific literature. Recent publications emphasize that a more realistic approach involves combining multiple types of biomarkers with other investigative tools (imaging, outcome scales, and genetic polymorphisms). Additionally, there is increasing interest in the use of biomarkers as tools for treatment monitoring and as surrogate outcome variables to facilitate the design of distinct randomized controlled trials.

Predictive and Discriminative Power of Pressure Reactivity Indices in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Riemann, Lennart; Beqiri, Erta; Younsi, Alexander; Czosnyka, Marek; Smielewski, Peter","BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional cerebral blood flow autoregulation plays a crucial role in the secondary damage after traumatic brain injury. The pressure reactivity index (PRx) can be used to monitor dynamic cerebral blood flow autoregulation indirectly., OBJECTIVE: To test different versions of the long pressure reactivity index (LPRx), which is based on minute-by-minute data and calculated over extended time windows, and to study their predictive ability and examine whether ""long"" and ""short"" pressure reactivity indices could improve predictive power., METHODS: PRx and 3 versions of the LPRx calculated over 20-, 60-, and 240-min time windows were assessed in relation to outcome at 6 mo in 855 patients with traumatic brain injury. Predictive power and discriminative ability of indices were evaluated using area under the operator curves and determination of critical thresholds. PRx and LPR indices were combined to evaluate whether LPR indices could improve outcome prediction by adding information about static components of autoregulation., RESULTS: Correlation of each LPRx with the PRx decreased with increased time windows. LPR indices performed successively worse in their predictive and discriminative ability from 20-min to 240-min time frames. PRx had a significantly higher predictive ability compared to each LPRx. Combining LPRx and PRx did not lead to an improvement of predictive power compared to the PRx alone., CONCLUSION: The critical threshold and predictive value of the PRx for unfavorable outcome and mortality have been confirmed in one of the largest so far published patient cohorts. LPRx performed significantly worse, and its discriminative and predictive abilities decreased with an increasing calculation window.

We investigate associations between active substance use, peri-injury factors, and outcome after TBI across three U.S. Level I trauma centers. TBI subjects from the prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot (TRACK-TBI Pilot) with Marshall computed tomography (CT) score 1-3, no neurosurgical procedure/operation, and admission urine toxicology screen (tox+/-) were extracted. Associations between tox+/-, comorbidities, hospital variables, and six-month functional (GOSE) and neuropsychiatric (PCL-C, BSI18, RPQ-13, SWLS) outcomes were analyzed. Multivariable regression was performed for associations significant on univariate analysis with odds ratios (mOR) presented. Significance assessed at p < 0.05. In 133 subjects, tox+/tox- were 29.1%/72.9%. Tox+ was younger (35.5/43.6-years, p = 0.018), trended toward male sex (80.6%/63.9%, p = 0.067), was associated with history of seizures (27.8%/10.3%, p = 0.012), self-reported substance use (44.4%/17.5%, p = 0.001), prior TBI (58.8%/34.1%, p = 0.009), GCS < 15 (69.4%/48.4%, p = 0.031) and blood alcohol level >0.08-mg/dl (55.6%/30.8%, p = 0.022). In CT-negative subjects, tox+ was associated with increased hospital admission (95.7%/66.7%, p = 0.034).

This study hypothesized that Rotterdam would outperform Marshall Classification System., DESIGN: The study used an observational cohort design with a consecutive sample of 88 participants (25 females, mean age = 42.0 [SD = 21.3]) with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to trauma service with subsequent transfer to the rehabilitation unit between February 2009 and July 2011 and who had clearly readable computed tomography scans. Twenty-three participants did not return for the 9-mo postdischarge follow-up. Day-of-injury computed tomography images were scored using both Marshall Classification System and Rotterdam criteria by two independent raters, blind to outcomes. Functional outcomes were measured by length of stay in rehabilitation and the cognitive and motor subscales of the Functional Independence Measure at rehabilitation discharge and 9-mo postdischarge follow-up., RESULTS: Neither Marshall Classification System nor Rotterdam scales as a whole significantly predicted Functional Independence Measure motor or cognitive outcomes at discharge or 9-mo follow-up. Both scales, however, predicted length of stay in rehabilitation. Specific Marshall scores (3 and 6) and Rotterdam scores (5 and 6) significantly predicted subacute outcomes such as Functional Independence Measure cognitive at discharge from rehabilitation and length of stay., CONCLUSIONS: Marshall Classification System and Rotterdam scales may have limited utility in predicting long-term functional outcome, but specific Marshall and Rotterdam scores, primarily linked to increased severity and intracranial pressure, may predict subacute outcomes.",2020,/,American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,99,9,821-829,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000001422,32195734,#4780,Frodsham 2020,,yes
Machine learning algorithms performed no better than regression models for prognostication in traumatic brain injury.,"Gravesteijn, Benjamin Y; Nieboer, Daan; Ercole, Ari; Lingsma, Hester F; Nelson, David; van Calster, Ben; Steyerberg, Ewout W; CENTER-TBI collaborators","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the added value of common machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of outcome for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury., STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed logistic regression (LR), lasso regression, and ridge regression with key baseline predictors in the IMPACT-II database (15 studies, n = 11,022). ML algorithms included support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and artificial neural networks and were trained using the same predictors. To assess generalizability of predictions, we performed internal, internal-external, and external validation on the recent CENTER-TBI study (patients with Glasgow Coma Scale <13, n = 1,554). Both calibration (calibration slope/intercept) and discrimination (area under the curve) was quantified., RESULTS: In the IMPACT-II database, 3,332/11,022 (30%) died and 5,233(48%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale less than 4). In the CENTER-TBI study, 348/1,554(29%) died and 651(54%) had unfavorable outcome. Discrimination and calibration varied widely between the studies and less so between the studied algorithms. The mean area under the curve was 0.82 for mortality and 0.77 for unfavorable outcomes in the CENTER-TBI study., CONCLUSION: ML algorithms may not outperform traditional regression approaches in a low-dimensional setting for outcome prediction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.

Incidence and Effect of Diabetes Insipidus in the Acute Care of Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Gempeler, Andres; Orrego-Gonzalez, Eduardo; Hernandez-Casanas, Andres; Castro, Andres M; Aristizabal-Mayor, Juan D; Mejia-Mantilla, Jorge H","BACKGROUND: Literature on diabetes insipidus (DI) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is scarce. Some studies have reported varying frequencies of DI and have showed its association with increased mortality, suggesting it as a marker of poor outcome. This knowledge gap in the acute care consequences of DI in severe TBI patients led us to conceive this study, aimed at identifying risk factors and quantifying the effect of DI on short-term functional outcomes and mortality., METHODS: We assembled a historic cohort of adult patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care university hospital over a 6-year period. Basic demographic characteristics, clinical information, imaging findings, and laboratory results were collected. We used logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for the development of DI, and the association of this condition with death and unfavorable functional outcomes [modified Rankin scale (mRS)] at hospital discharge., RESULTS: A total of 317 patients were included in the study. The frequency of DI was 14.82%, and it presented at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after ICU admission. Severity according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and skull base fracture was suggested as risk factors for DI. Diagnosis of DI was independently associated death (OR 4.34, CI 95% 1.92-10.11, p = 0.0005) and unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 4-6) at discharge (OR 7.38; CI 95% 2.15-37.21, p = 0.0047)., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes insipidus is a frequent and early complication in patients with severe TBI in the ICU and is strongly associated with increased mortality and poor short-term outcomes.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers of Brain Connectivity in Predicting Outcome after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review.,"Puig, Josep; Ellis, Michael J; Kornelsen, Jennifer; Figley, Teresa D; Figley, Chase R; Daunis-I-Estadella, Pepus; Mutch, W Alan C; Essig, Marco","There is growing interest in developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of brain connectivity from resting-state functional (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to aid in the diagnosis and management of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). To determine whether early MRI biomarkers of brain connectivity are useful in predicting outcome after mTBI, we conducted a systematic review using the following inclusion criteria: 1) patients aged >16 years with mTBI, 2) MRI performed during the first month post-injury, 3) outcome measure available, 4) control group, and 5) original article published in a peer-reviewed journal. Of the 1351 citations identified, 14 studies met inclusion criteria (5 rs-fMRI and 10 DTI; 680 patients with mTBI vs. 436 controls) including those where MRI was performed from <12 h to 1 month post-injury. The most common clinical outcome measure used in these studies was symptom burden using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire. The most frequently studied brain connectivity MRI biomarkers were global functional connectivity, default-mode network, and fractional anisotropy (FA). Despite the scant evidence and considerable methodological heterogeneity observed among studies, we conclude that brain connectivity MRI biomarkers obtained within 1 month of injury may be potentially useful in predicting outcome in mTBI. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the effect of mTBI on MRI-based brain connectivity biomarkers and examine how incorporation of these tests can inform the clinical care of individual mTBI patients.",2020,/,Journal of neurotrauma,37,16,1761-1776,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6623,32228145,#4756,Puig 2020,,yes

We investigated the relation of the GFAP and UCH-L1 levels to the severity of TBI and their prognostic value during the first week after the injury. METHOD(S): Serum UCH-L1 and GFAP were measured from 389 consecutive patients with acute TBI and 81 controls enrolled in a multicenter prospective study (TBIcare). The measures included initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), head computed tomography (CT) scan, and blood samples (admission and on days 1, 2, 3, and 7). The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or its extended version (GOSe). RESULT(S): GFAP and UCH-L1 levels on admission and during the first 2 days after the injury correlated with the initial GCS. In addition, UCH-L1 levels on the seventh day correlated with the initial GCS. On admission, AUC (receiver operating characteristics) of biomarkers for distinguishing any pathological finding in CT was 0.739 and 0.621, for GFAP and UCH-L1, respectively. There was a negative correlation with the outcome and UCH-L1 and GFAP levels on the first 3 and 2 days, respectively. UCH-L1 and GFAP distinguished patients with GOS 1 to 3 from patients with GOS 4 to 5. For UCH-L1 to predict unfavorable outcome (GOS , 4), incomplete recovery (GOSe , 8), or death, the AUC was 0.727, 0.538, and 0.655, respectively. For GFAP the corresponding AUCs were 0.723, 0.628, and 0.716, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): These results support the prior findings of the potential role of GFAP and UCH-L1 in acute phase and prognostic diagnostics of TBI.

Blood biomarkers in moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: Potential utility of a multi-marker approach in characterizing outcome,Di Battista A.P.; Buonora J.E.; Rhind S.G.; Hutchison M.G.; Baker A.J.; Rizoli S.B.; Diaz-Arrastia R.; Mueller G.P. ,"Background: Blood biomarkers are valuable tools for elucidating complex cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI). Profiling distinct classes of biomarkers could aid in the identification and characterization of initial injury and secondary pathological processes. This study characterized the prognostic performance of a recently developed multi-marker panel of circulating biomarkers that reflect specific pathogenic mechanisms including neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, and neuroregeneration, in moderate-to-severe TBI patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood was drawn from 85 isolated TBI patients (n = 60 severe, n = 25 moderate) at hospital admission, 6-, 12-, and 24-h post-injury. Mortality and neurological outcome were assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. A multiplex platform was designed on MULTI-SPOT plates to simultaneously analyze human plasma levels of s100 calcium binding protein beta (s100B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron specific enolase (NSE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-5, and peroxiredoxin (PRDX)-6. Multivariable logistic regression and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate both individual and combined predictive abilities of these markers for 6-month neurological outcome and mortality after TBI. Result(s): Unfavorable neurological outcome was associated with elevations in s100B, GFAP, and MCP-1. Mortality was related to differences in six of the seven markers analyzed. Combined admission concentrations of s100B, GFAP, and MCP-1 were able to discriminate favorable versus unfavorable outcome (AUC = 0.83), and survival versus death (AUC = 0.87), although not significantly better than s100B alone (AUC = 0.82 and 0.86, respectively). Conclusion(s): The multi-marker panel of TBI-related biomarkers performed well in discriminating unfavorable and favorable outcomes in the acute period after moderate-to-severe TBI.

Performance of prediction for short-term mortality in patients after severe traumatic brain injury: Inclusion of initial Glasgow Coma Scales and abbreviated injury score of head region,Kesmarky K.J.; Delhumeau C.; Zenobi M.; Walder B. ,"Objectives: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the abbreviated injury score of head region (HAIS) are validated prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to compare models with GCS and/or HAIS and supplementary initial prognostic factors assessed on scene (OS) and at hospital admission (ED) to estimate their prognostic performance and accuracy of discrimination for shortterm mortality. Method(s): Secondary analysis of a prospective epidemiological cohort study including patients after severe TBI (HAIS > 3) with follow-up from the time of accident until 14 days or earlier death was performed in Switzerland. Performance of prediction (positive predictive value, PPV; negative predictive value, NPV) and accuracy of discrimination (area under the ROC curve, AUC) of different predictive test models were investigated. Result(s): The cohort included 624 patients (median age = 54, interquartile range (IQR) = 32-71, median GCS (OS) = 9 (4- 14), abnormal pupil reaction = 26%). Best performance of prediction and best accuracy of discrimination with four simple variables had the following prediction models: (A) HAIS, motor part of GCS (OS), pupil reaction, age (PPV = 72%, NPV = 82%; AUC = 0.85); (B) HAIS, motor part of GCS (OS), pupil reaction, age (PPV = 70%, NPV = 84%; AUC = 0.85); and (C) HAIS, GCS (ED), pupil reaction, age (PPV = 70%, NPV = 84%; AUC = 0.85). Conclusion(s): Best performance of prediction and accuracy of discrimination for short-term mortality after severe TBI was observed with a multi-variable prediction model using HAIS, motor GCS or GCS, pupil reaction and age. The combination of HAIS and GCS improve prediction for short-term mortality.

Predicting major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder after traumatic brain injury: A systematic review,Cnossen M.C.; Scholten A.C.; Lingsma H.F.; Haagsma J.; Polinder S. ,"Objectives: While it is known that major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent after traumatic brain injury (TBI), little is known of factors predicting these psychiatric conditions. This knowledge could, however, provide physicians and patients information about prognosis and can help decide whether specialized follow-up care or early treatment might be useful. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of predictors and prediction models of MDD and PTSD after TBI. Method(s): We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar in January 2015. We identified studies in civilian adults with TBI reporting on predictors or prediction models of either MDD or PTSD. We only included studies using structured diagnostic interviews to diagnose MDD or PTSD, because self-reports from TBI patients may be unreliable due to the overlap between psychiatric symptoms and disorders, memory deficits associated with TBI and evidence that TBI patients tend to under-estimate their functional problems. Two independent reviewers extracted data according to the critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies (CHARMS) checklist. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) Risk of Bias Assessment Instrument. Result(s): We included 23 observational studies assessing predictors or prediction models of MDD (n = 16) and/or PTSD (n = 8). Overall methodological quality of the included studies was satisfactory, although the majority of studies that assessed the effect of single predictors did not adjust sufficiently for potential confounding factors. The included studies showed that MDD and PTSD after TBI were not predicted by demographic variables or TBI severity. MDD was strongly related to pre-injury depression and some intracranial abnormalities. PTSD was predominately related to post-injury factors such as coping and early stress symptoms. Having a memory of the traumatic event also increased the likelihood on developing PTSD. Methodology of the studies that developed a prognostic model was poor; all models were at risk for overfitting, since they included too many candidate predictors given their sample size. Conclusion(s): Currently available prediction studies of MDD and PTSD after TBI suffer from methodological shortcomings, but can form the basis for future development of a prediction model from a large sample of TBI patients using a limited set of predictors.",2016,/,Brain Injury,30,06-May,517,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2016.1162060,614042541,#22629,Cnossen 2016,,yes
Prognostic markers for neuropsychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury,Roy D.; Rao V.; Bechtold K.; Peters M.; Leoutsakos J.-M.; Han D.; Vassila A.; Falk H.; Ofoche U.; Fernandez C.; Hall A.J.; Anderson B.; Korley F. ,"Objectives: There are currently no prognostic markers for the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The goal of this study was to identify protein and inflammatory markers obtained soon after injury that can serve as potential prognostic markers for neuropsychiatric symptoms at 3 and 6 months of injury. Method(s): We analyzed data from The Head injury Serum Markers for Assessing Response to Trauma (HeadSMART) cohort, a prospective cohort of TBI patients presenting to two urban emergency departments. Blood samples were obtained within 24 hours of injury and subjects were interviewed on the day of injury. Subjects were followed at 1, 3 and 6 months and underwent comprehensive psychiatric examination. Based on previous analysis and studies that have identified prognostic biomarkers implicated in brain injury markers chosen for the current analyses included brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and metallothionein-3. Result(s): A total of 151 subjects were enrolled between April 2014 and August 2015. The mean age of the sample was 52 (SD = 21.6); mean education level = 12.7 years (2.6); 55% of the sample were males and 47% Caucasians. The presenting GCS mean score of the sample was 14.6. Only 18% had an abnormal CT head. On unadjusted linear regression analysis there was a statistically significant negative association between BDNF and the Rivermead PostConcussion score at 6 months (b = -0.345; p = 0.024). After adjusting for age, education, race and gender, the relationship remained statistically significant. The adjusted linear regression analysis also revealed a statistically significant relationship between metallothionein- 3 and scores on the Davidson Trauma scale (DTS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7) both at 6 months (b = -6.07; p = 0.11; b = -0.469; p = 0.02, respectively).

Sharp clinical monitoring after trauma leads to better long-term prognosis. Ultrasound of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is used to non-invasively estimate intracranial hypertension in neuro-critically ill patients. ONSD prognostic value has never been systematically studied in TBI patients. We aim to evaluate prognostic value of ONSD distension in moderate to severe TBI patients. Method(s): we evaluated consecutive moderate to severe TBI patients (GCS < 15; or intracranial traumatic lesion), aged between 18 and 80-years-old, admitted to a tertiary academic hospital in Brazil from February/2015 to July/ 2015. Glasgow Coma (GCS) and NOS-TBI scales defined neurological severity. ONSD standard methodology mea-surements were held by two investigators, blinded to initial TBI severity scores, using Toshiba Xario TM USG machine. Univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression identified independent predictors of bad outcome at discharge (NOS-TBI > 30). Result(s): 70 patients were evaluated: 63 (90%) male, mean age of 37.5 (18-76) years, 32 (45%) with severe TBI; 29 (41%) TBI related to traffic accidents. Median GCS at admission was 10 [5-14] and median NOS-TBI score at discharge was 10.5 (IQR 4.35-31.25). On multivariate logistic regression, mean ONSD (OR: 1.8; 95%CI: 1.04- 3.27; p: 0.34) was independently associated with discharge NOS-TBI score, after adjustment for the baseline GCS (OR: 0.83; 95%CI: 0.73-0.95; p: 0.010).

Role of computed tomography scores and findings to predict early death in patients with traumatic brain injury: A reappraisal in a major tertiary care hospital in Nepal,Munakomi S.; Bhattarai B.; Srinivas B.; Cherian I. ,"Background: Glasgow Coma Scale has been a long sought model to classify patients with head injury. However, the major limitation of the score is its assessment in the patients who are either sedated or under the influence of drugs or intubated for airway protection. The rational approach for prognostication of such patients is the utility of scoring system based on the morphological criteria based on radiological imaging. Among the current armamentarium, a scoring system based on computed tomography (CT) imaging holds the greatest promise in conquering our conquest for the same. Method(s): We included a total of 634 consecutive neurosurgical trauma patients in this series, who presented with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) from January 2013 to April 2014 at a tertiary care center in rural Nepal. All pertinent medical records (including all available imaging studies) were reviewed by the neurosurgical consultant and the radiologist on call. Patients' worst CT image scores and their outcome at 30 days were assessed and recorded. We then assessed their independent performance in predicting the mortality and also tried to seek the individual variables that had significant interplay for determining the same. Result(s): Both imaging score (Marshall) and clinical score (Rotterdam) can be used to reliably predict mortality in patients with acute TBI with high prognostic accuracy. Other specific CT characteristics that can be used to predict early mortality are traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, midline shift, and status of the peri-mesencephalic cisterns. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated in this cohort that though the Marshall score has the high predictive power to determine the mortality, better discrimination could be sought through the application of the Rotterdam score that encompasses various individual CT parameters. We thereby recommend the use of such comprehensive prognostic model so as to augment our predictive power for properly dichotomizing the prognosis of the patients with TBI. In the future, it will therefore be important to develop prognostic models that are applicable for the majority of patients in the world they live in, and not just a privileged few who can use resources not necessarily representative of their societal environment.Copyright © 2016 Surgical Neurology International  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",2016,/,Surgical Neurology International,7,1,23,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.177125,609196691,#22544,Munakomi 2016,,yes
Role of alpha-II-spectrin breakdown products in the prediction of the severity and clinical outcome of acute traumatic brain injury,Chen S.; Shi Q.; Zheng S.; Luo L.; Yuan S.; Wang X.; Cheng Z.; Zhang W. ,"alphaII-spectrin breakdown products are regarded as potential biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of the present study was to further evaluate these biomarkers by assessing their clinical utility in predicting the severity of injury and clinical outcome of patients with TBI. Eligible patients with acute TBI (n=17), defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of <=8, were enrolled. Ventricular cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) was sampled from each patient at 24, 72 and 120 h following TBI. An immunoblot assay was used to determine the concentrations of SBDPs in the CSF samples. The concentrations of SBDPs combined with the GCS score at 24 h after injury and the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 30 days after injury were compared and analyzed. The levels of SBDPs in CSF were markedly increased following acute TBI in comparison with those in the control group. In the early period after TBI, the levels of SBDPs were closely associated with GCS score. Comparisons of the SBDP levels with the severity of injury revealed significant differences between patients with the most severe brain injury and patients with severe brain injury in the first 24 h post-injury (P<0.05). The levels and dynamic changes of SBDPs in CSF exhibited a close association with GOS at 30 days after injury. The levels of SBDPs differed significantly between patients grouped according to prognosis (P<0.05). These results suggest that in the early period after TBI, the levels and dynamic changes of SBDPs in CSF can be useful in the prediction of the severity of injury and clinical outcome of patients.Copyright © 2016, Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine.

"Comparison of glasgow coma scale, full outline of unresponsiveness and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation in prediction of mortality rate among patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to intensive care unit",Hosseini S.H.; Ayyasi M.; Akbari H.; Heidari-Gorji M.A. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Choosing an appropriate diagnostic tool is critical in early stage for appropriate decision about primary diagnosis, medical care and prognosis. Objective(s): This study aimed to compare the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), full outline of unresponsiveness (FOUR) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) with respect to prediction of the mortality rate of patients with TBI admitted to intensive care unit. Patients and Methods: This diagnostic study was conducted on 80 patients with TBI in educational hospitals. The scores of APACHE II, GCS and FOUR were recorded during the first 24 hours of admission of patients. In this study, early mortality means the patient death before 14 days and delayed mortality means the patient death 15 days after admitting to hospital. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inductive statistics. Result(s): The results showed that the mean age of the patients was 33.80 +/- 12.60. From a total of 80 patients with TBI, 16 (20%) were females and 64 (80%) males. The mortality rate was 15 (18.7%). The results showed no significant difference among three tools. In prediction of early mortality, the areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.92 (CI = 0.95. 0.81 - 0.97), 0.90 (CI = 0.95. 0.74 - 0.94), and 0.96 (CI = 0.95. 0.87 - 0.9) for FOUR, APACHE II and GCS, respectively. In delayed mortality, the AUCs were 0.89 (CI = 0.95. 0.81-0.94), 0.94 (CI = 0.95. 0.74 - 0.97) and 0.90 (CI = 0.95. 0.87 - 0.95) for FOUR, APACHE II and GCS, respectively. Conclusion(s): Considering that GCS is easy to use and the FOUR can diagnose a locking syndrome along same values of subscales. These two subscales are superior to APACHI II in prediction of early mortality. Conversation APACHE II is more punctual in the prediction of delayed mortality.Copyright © 2016, Iranian Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ISRAPM).",2016,/,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine,6,2,e33653,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5812/aapm.33653,610048571,#22529,Hosseini 2016,,yes

Material and Methods This prospective study included 76 patients with cerebral contusion on plain CT of the brain, aged 5 to 86 years, admitted in our institution. They underwent perfusion CT as part of their admission CT survey and follow-up scan 48 hours later. Clinical data, unenhanced CT brain findings, and perfusion CT scans were evaluated with respect to the postoperative GCS (Glasgow Coma Score) and neurologic deficit. Results Perfusion CT gave additional information when done with conventional unenhanced CT in the detection of cerebral contusions. Perfusion CT featured specific patterns with respect to patient outcome, patients with unfavorable outcome having significant decrease in cerebral perfusion. In patients having less GCS score, a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume was detected.

Electrocardiographic Changes in Patients with Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury and Their Correlation with Outcome,Samudrala V.D.; Kumar A.; Agrawal A. ,"Objectives Electrocardiography (ECG) can be used as an inexpensive tool to identify high-risk patients who are at risk of developing cardiac dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present article, we report our experience with the incidence of electrocardiographic changes in patients with TBI patients and their correlation with overall outcome. Materials and Methods All the patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of TBI under neurosurgery were included in the study. Clinical details and 12 lead ECG details for any ECG abnormalities (rhythm abnormalities, conduction abnormalities, QRS ST complex abnormalities, nonspecific ST changes, QT interval abnormalities, and data regarding outcome) were recorded. The data were entered into a spreadsheet and analyzed using StatsDirect version 3 statistical analysis software. Data were expressed using descriptive statistics-frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Pearson chi-square test was used to identify significance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 109 patients and same number of admission ECGs were available for interpretation. Mild head injury was most common (65.1%) followed by severe (18.3%) and moderate (15.6%) head injuries. ECG results were normal in 97 patients and were abnormal in 12 patients. Statistical analysis showed that the correlation among severity of the head injury, ECG results, and outcome was significant. However, there was no significant correlation between QTc and outcome, and correlation between severity of head injury and outcome. Conclusion The present study highlights the need to recognize the importance of ECG as a simple tool to identify the cardiovascular changes in patients with TBI. However, there is a need to conduct further prospective studies to supplement these findings with changes in the levels of cardiac enzymes or associated echocardiography abnormalities and their correlation with ECG findings and overall outcome.Copyright © 2016 Neurotrauma Society of India.",2016,/,Indian Journal of Neurotrauma,13,2,70-74,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1586237,611675247,#22488,Samudrala 2016,,yes
Outcome in patients with head injury: Do extra-cranial injuries worsen prognosis?,Dua V.; Ahuja N.; Bhagat H.; Samra T.; Ganesh V.; Dhatt S.; Khanna P.; Salunke P. ,"Introduction: Patient age and severity of brain injury arc validated prognostic indicators in patients with polytrauma. This prospective observational study was conducted to study the influence of extracranial injuries on neurological outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methodology: Patients with TBI aged 20-60 years were enrolled and categorized into two groups: Group 1- with extracranial injuries; Group 2- without extracranial injuries. Patients with fixed and dilated pupils, brainstem injuries, delay of more than 24 hours for hospitalization, and patients who developed secondary insults were excluded. Result(s): Complete follow up and data collection was feasible in 33 patients of Group 1 and in 47 patients of Group 2. Severity of head injury, SOFA score, co-morbid conditions, duration of hospital stay, mortality, GCS scores on admission and A GCS (GCS on admission - GCS at time of discharge) were comparable between the two groups. The duration of mechanical ventilation and the 1SS scores were significantly higher in patients with extracranial injuries. Kxtracrania! injuries did not influence the survival rate. Severity of head injury was the prime determinant of survival. Extracranial injuries were shown to have a synergistic effect on morbidity.

Visual Fixation in the ICU: A Strong Predictor of Long-Term Recovery after Moderate-to-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury*,Arbour C.; Baril A.-A.; Westwick H.J.; Potvin M.-J.; Gilbert D.; Giguere J.-F.; Lavigne G.J.; Desautels A.; Bernard F.; Laureys S.; Gosselin N. ,"Objective: Posttraumatic amnesia is superior to the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score for predicting traumatic brain injury recovery, but it takes days/weeks to assess. Here, we examined whether return of visual fixation - a potential marker of higher cognitive function - within 24 hours of ICU admission could be used as an early predictor of traumatic brain injury recovery. Design(s): Two-phase cohort study. Setting(s): Level-I trauma ICU. Patient(s): Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury discharged alive between 2010 and 2013. Intervention(s): None. Measurements and Main Results: Return of visual fixation was assessed through standard behavioral assessments in 181 traumatic brain injury patients who had lost the ability to fixate at ICU admission (phase 1) and compared with posttraumatic amnesia duration and the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score to predict performance on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 10-40 months after injury (n = 144; phase 2a). A subgroup also completed a visual attention task (n = 35; phase 2b) and a brain MRI after traumatic brain injury (n = 23; phase 2c). With an area under the curve equal to 0.85, presence/absence of visual fixation at 24 hours of ICU admission was found as performant as posttraumatic amnesia (area under the curve, 0.81; difference between area under the curve, 0.04; p = 0.28) for predicting patients' Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score. Conversely, the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was not (area under the curve, 0.63). Even when controlling for age/medication/CT scan findings, fixation remained a significant predictor of Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended scores (beta, -0.29; p < 0.05). Poorer attention performances and greater regional brain volume deficits were also observed in patients who could not fixate at 24 hours of ICU admission versus those who could. Conclusion(s): Visual fixation within 24 hours of ICU admission could be as performant as posttraumatic amnesia for predicting traumatic brain injury recovery, introducing a new variable of interest in traumatic brain injury outcome research.Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",2016,/,Critical Care Medicine,44,12,e1186-e1193,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000001960,611574932,#22464,Arbour 2016,,yes
Early prediction of outcome after severe traumatic brain injury: A simple and practical model,Rizoli S.; Petersen A.; Bulger E.; Coimbra R.; Kerby J.D.; Minei J.; Morrison L.; Nathens A.; Schreiber M.; de Oliveira Manoel A.L. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a heterogeneous syndrome with a broad range of outcome. We developed a simple model for long-term outcome prognostication after severe TBI. Method(s): Secondary data analysis of a large multicenter randomized trial. Patients were grouped according to 6-month extended Glasgow outcome scale (eGOS): poor-outcome (eGOS <= 4; severe disability or death) and acceptable outcome (eGOS > 4; no or moderate disability). A prediction decision tree was built using binary recursive partitioning to predict poor or acceptable 6-month outcome. Comparison to two previously published and validated models was made. Result(s): The decision tree included the predictors of head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity, the Marshall computed tomography score, and pupillary reactivity. All patients with a head AIS severity of 5 were predicted to have a poor outcome. In patients with head AIS severity < 5, the model predicted an acceptable outcome for (1) those with Marshall score of 1, and (2) those with Marshall score above 1 but with reactive pupils at admission. The decision tree had a sensitivity of 72.3 % (95 % CI: 66.4-77.6 %) and specificity of 62.5 % (95 % CI: 54.9-69.6 %). The proportion correctly classified for the comparison models was similar to our model. Our model was more apt at correctly classifying those with poor outcome but more likely to misclassify those with acceptable outcome than the comparison models. Conclusion(s): Predicting long-term outcome early after TBI remains challenging and inexact. This model could be useful for research and quality improvement studies to provide an early assessment of injury severity, but is not sufficiently accurate to guide decision-making in the clinical setting.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,/,BMC Emergency Medicine,16,1,32,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12873-016-0098-x,611766277,#22422,Rizoli 2016,,yes
Functional resting-state fMRI connectivity correlates with serum levels of the S100B protein in the acute phase of traumatic brain injury,Thompson W.H.; Thelin E.P.; Lilja A.; Bellander B.-M.; Fransson P. ,"The S100B protein is an intra-cellular calcium-binding protein that mainly resides in astrocytes in the central nervous system. The serum level of S100B is used as biomarker for the severity of brain damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. In this study we investigated the relationship between intrinsic resting-state brain connectivity, measured 1-22 days (mean 8 days) after trauma, and serum levels of S100B in a patient cohort with mild-to-severe TBI in need of neuro-intensive care in the acute phase. In line with previous investigations, our results show that the peak level of S100B acquired during the acute phase of TBI was negatively correlated with behavioral measures (Glasgow Outcome Score, GOS) of functional outcome assessed 6 to 12 months post injury. Using a multi-variate pattern analysis-informed seed-based correlation analysis, we show that the strength of resting-state brain connectivity in multiple resting-state networks was negatively correlated with the peak of serum levels of S100B. A negative correspondence between S100B peak levels recorded 12-36 h after trauma and intrinsic connectivity was found for brain regions located in the default mode, fronto-parietal, visual and motor resting-state networks. Our results suggest that resting-state brain connectivity measures acquired during the acute phase of TBI is concordant with results obtained from molecular biomarkers and that it may hold a capacity to predict long-term cognitive outcome in TBI patients.Copyright © 2016 The Authors",2016,/,NeuroImage: Clinical,12,"(Thompson, Thelin, Bellander, Fransson) Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden(Bellander) Department of Neurosurgery, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden(Lilja) Section of Neuroradiology, Department of ",1004-1012,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2016.05.005,610537808,#22421,Thompson 2016,,yes
The Serum Phosphorylated Neurofilament Heavy Subunit as a Predictive Marker for Outcome in Adult Patients after Traumatic Brain Injury,Shibahashi K.; Doi T.; Tanaka S.; Hoda H.; Chikuda H.; Sawada Y.; Takasu Y.; Chiba K.; Nozaki T.; Hamabe Y.; Ogata T. ,"The serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit (pNF-H) is a nervous system-specific protein that is released from damaged neural tissue after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to elucidate the usefulness of serum pNF-H as a predictive marker for the outcome of patients after TBI. Patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 or less on admission) were included. Patients who were younger than age 18, dependent on others for daily activities before injury, pregnant, or who were not likely to survive for more than 24 h after injury were excluded. The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months after injury. Blood was collected from subjects (n = 32), and the serum pNF-H value was assessed at 24 and 72 h after TBI. The optimal cutoff value and usefulness of the serum pNF-H value for predicting the long-term outcome were investigated. We found that the serum pNF-H value at 24 h after injury was a good predictive marker of death at 6 months (p < 0.001) after injury. The optimal cutoff value was 240 pg/mL, and the area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.930. The serum pNF-H value at 72 h after injury was correlated with an unfavorable outcome (vegetative state or death) at 6 months (p < 0.01) with a cutoff value of 80 pg/mL. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that the serum pNF-H value is a useful predictive marker for patient outcome after TBI.Copyright © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2016,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,33,20,1826-1833,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4237,612942544,#22410,Shibahashi 2016,,yes
White matter injuries in mild traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic migraines: Diffusion entropy analysis,Delic J.; Alhilali L.M.; Hughes M.A.; Gumus S.; Fakhran S. ,"Purpose: To determine the performance of Shannon entropy (SE) as a diagnostic tool in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with posttraumatic migraines (PTMs) and those without PTMs on the basis of analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, with waiver of informed consent. FA maps were obtained and neurocognitive testing was performed in 74 patients with mTBI (57 with PTM, 17 without PTM). FA maps were obtained in 22 healthy control subjects and in 20 control patients with migraine headaches. Mean FA and SE were extracted from total brain FA histograms and were compared between patients with mTBI and control subjects and between patients with and those without PTM. Mean FA and SE were correlated with clinical variables and were used to determine the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) and likelihood ratios for mTBI and development of PTM. Result(s): Patients with mTBI had significantly lower SE (P < .001) and trended toward lower mean FA (P = .07) compared with control subjects. SE inversely correlated with time to recovery (TTR) (r = 20.272, P = .02). Patients with mTBI with PTM had significantly lower SE (P < .001) but not mean FA (P = .15) than did other patients with mTBI. SE provided better discrimination between patients with mTBI and control subjects than mean FA (AUC = 0.92; P = .01), as well as better discrimination between patients with mTBI with PTM and those without PTM (AUC = 0.85; P < .001). SE of less than 0.751 resulted in a 16.1 increased likelihood of having experienced mTBI and a 3.2 increased likelihood of developing PTM. Conclusion(s): SE more accurately reveals mTBI than mean FA, more accurately reveals those patients with mTBI who develop PTM, and inversely correlates with TTR.Copyright © 2016 RSNA.",2016,/,Radiology,279,3,859-866,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015151388,621079752,#22403,Delic 2016,,yes
Contusion contrast extravasation depicted on multidetector computed tomography angiography predicts growth and mortality in traumatic brain contusion,Rosa M.; Da Rocha A.J.; Maia A.C.M.; Saade N.; Veiga J.C.E.; Romero J.M. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the main cause of death in trauma victims and causes high rates of disability and neurological sequelae. Approximately 38-65% of traumatic brain contusions (TBC) demonstrate hemorrhagic expansion on serial computed tomography (CT) scans. Thus far, however, no single variable can accurately predict the hemorrhage expansion of a TBC. Our purpose was to evaluate contrast extravasation (CE) as a predictor of expansion, mortality, and poor outcome in TBC in a Brazilian cohort. After Institutional Review Board approval, we used multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) to study 121 consecutive patients (106 men, 87.6%) with ages varying from 10 to 85 years. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The clinical and imaging findings were correlated with the findings on the initial MDCTA using either the Fisher exact test or Student t test and a multivariate logistic regression model. Of the persons who presented CE in TBC, 21.8% died (in-hospital mortality), whereas in the absence of this sign, the mortality rate was 7.6% (p = 0.014). In addition, expansion of the hemorrhagic component of the TBC was detected in 61.1% of the CE-positive patients, whereas expansion was only observed in 10% of the CE-negative patients (p < 0.001). Poor outcome was observed in 24.2% of the patients in the CE-negative group, but in the presence of CE, 72.7% evolved with poor outcome (p < 0.001). The CE was a strong independent predictor of expansion, poor outcome, and increased risk of in-hospital mortality in our series of patients with TBC.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",2016,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,33,11,1015-1022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4062,610582876,#22398,Rosa 2016,,yes
Outcome prediction after traumatic brain injury: Comparison of the performance of routinely used severity scores and multivariable prognostic models,Majdan M.; Brazinova A.; Rusnak M.; Leitgeb J. ,"Objectives: Prognosis of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important in the assessment of quality of care and can help improve treatment and outcome. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of relatively simple injury severity scores between each other and against a gold standard model - the IMPACT-extended (IMP-E) multivariable prognostic model. Material(s) and Method(s): For this study, 866 patients with moderate/severe TBI from Austria were analyzed. The prognostic performances of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), GCS motor (GCSM) score, abbreviated injury scale for the head region, Marshall computed tomographic (CT) classification, and Rotterdam CT score were compared side-by-side and against the IMP-E score. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and Nagelkerke's R2 were used to assess the prognostic performance. Outcomes at the Intensive Care Unit, at hospital discharge, and at 6 months (mortality and unfavorable outcome) were used as end-points. Result(s): Comparing AUCs and R2s of the same model across four outcomes, only little variation was apparent. A similar pattern is observed when comparing the models between each other: Variation of AUCs <+/-0.09 and R2s by up to +/-0.17 points suggest that all scores perform similarly in predicting outcomes at various points (AUCs: 0.65-0.77; R2s: 0.09-0.27). All scores performed significantly worse than the IMP-E model (with AUC > 0.83 and R2 > 0.42 for all outcomes): AUCs were worse by 0.10-0.22 (P < 0.05) and R2s were worse by 0.22-0.39 points. Conclusion(s): All tested simple scores can provide reasonably valid prognosis. However, it is confirmed that well-developed multivariable prognostic models outperform these scores significantly and should be used for prognosis in patients after TBI wherever possible.Copyright © 2017 Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",2017,/,Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice,8,1,20-29,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0976-3147.193543,613448500,#22365,Majdan 2017,,yes
Inflammation and outcome in traumatic brain injury: Has gender effect on survival and prognosis,Naghibi T.; Mohajeri M.; Dobakhti F. ,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury accounts for the majority of trauma deaths and there has been increased interest in the understanding the role of prognostic factors. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level increases rapidly in response to trauma. Aim(s): Aim of the present study was to indicate the role of C-reactive protein as a predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury patients based on their gender category. materials and methods: A prospective cohort study in a surgical intensive care unit in one of the Zanjan University of Medical Science hospital was designed. Fifty nine head trauma patients were divided into two groups based on their gender. Serum CRP was measured 48 hours after trauma. All data including the length of intensive care unit stay, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at discharge, andmortality were collected. The relationship between the clinical features and serum CRP level was also studied. Result(s): In the male group, CRP level was not significantly correlated with the length of intensive care unit stay, the duration of mechanical ventilation and GCS at discharge. In the female group, CRP level was positively correlated with the length of intensive care unit stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation; however, CRP level was not significantly correlated with GCS at discharge. These results remain constant in female sub group with severe head injury contrast to female with mild injury. conclusion: The GCS level can predict the outcome of females with severe head injury better than females with mild head injury and males.Copyright © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Relationship of circulating CXCR4+ EPC with prognosis of mild traumatic brain injury patients,Lin Y.; Luo L.L.; Sun J.; Gao W.; Tian Y.; Park E.; Baker A.; Chen J.; Jiang R.; Zhang J. ,"To investigate the changes of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1alpha)/CXCR4 expression in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the correlation between EPC level and the prognosis of mild TBI. 72 TBI patients (57 mild TBI, 15 moderate TBI patients) and 25 healthy subjects (control) were included. The number of circulating EPCs, CD34+, and CD133+ cells and the percentage of CXCR4+ cells in each cell population at 1,4,7,14,21 days after TBI were counted by flow cytometer. SDF-1a levels in serum were detected by ELISA assay. The patients were divided into poor and good prognosis groups based on Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and Activity of Daily Living Scale at 3 months after TBI. Correlation analysis between each detected index and prognosis of mild TBI was performed. Moderate TBI patients have higher levels of SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression than mild TBI patients (P < 0.05). The percentage of CXCR4+ EPCs at day 7 post-TBI was significantly higher in mild TBI patients with poor prognosis than the ones with good prognosis (P < 0.05). HAMA and HAMD scores in mild TBI patients were significantly lower than moderate TBI patients (P < 0.05) in early term. The percentage of CXCR4+ EPCs at day 7 after TBI was significantly correlated with the prognosis outcome at 3 months. The mobilization of circulating EPCs can be induced in mild TBI. The expression of CXCR4+ in EPCs at 7 days after TBI reflects the short-term prognosis of brain injury, and could be a potential biological marker for prognosis prediction of mild TBI.Copyright © 2017.",2017,/,Aging and Disease,8,1,115-127,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14336/AD.2016.0610,614619899,#22355,Lin 2017,,yes
Elevated glutamate and lactate predict brain death after severe head trauma,Stefani M.A.; Modkovski R.; Hansel G.; Zimmer E.R.; Kopczynski A.; Muller A.P.; Strogulski N.R.; Rodolphi M.S.; Carteri R.K.; Schmidt A.P.; Oses J.P.; Smith D.H.; Portela L.V. ,"Objective: Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Result(s): Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55-98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55-98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation(s): This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Dynamic changes of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in the serum of patients with craniocerebral trauma,Du X.; Dong B.; Li C.; Zhang F.; Ji Y.; Zhang J.; Yin C. ,"The aim of the study was to investigate dynamic changes in alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) levels in the serum of patients with craniocerebral trauma. Forty-eight patients with acute craniocerebral injury were selected between January 2015 and October 2016. The patients were divided into three groups: severe (18 cases), moderate (16 cases) and mild (14 cases), according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission. At the same time, 10 adults with a similar age distribution to the patients were also selected as a control group. Venous blood was extracted from patients at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after injury. Serum alpha-MSH and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The correlation between alpha-MSH and TNF-alpha was analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis. Serum alpha-MSH levels in patients with craniocerebral injury were lower than those in the healthy control group (P<0.05). Decreased serum alpha-MSH levels were usually accompanied with higher degrees of craniocerebral injury. Serum alpha-MSH levels initially decreased and then later increased, with the lowest alpha-MSH levels in the mild at 5 days, moderate at 5 days, and severe groups at 3 days after injury (P<0.05). Serum TNF-alpha levels in all the patient groups were higher than those in the control group at different time points after injury, with higher TNF-alpha serum levels accompanying higher degrees of brain injury. In all three groups, serum TNF-alpha levels initially increased and then decreased post-injury, with peak serum TNF-alpha levels found at 3-day post-injury in all the patient groups (P<0.05). A negative correlation between serum alpha-MSH content and serum TNF-alpha levels in patients with craniocerebral trauma at different time points, was noted (P<0.05). Serum alpha-MSH content in the survival group was higher than that in the death group (P<0.05). Serum alpha-MSH levels in patients with non-systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were higher than in patients with SIRS (P<0.05). Serum alpha-MSH levels during the early stages after craniocerebral trauma can be used as a factor for the prediction of secondary SIRS, with constant low levels of serum alpha-MSH suggest poor prognosis.Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

External validation of the rotterdam computed tomography score in the prediction of mortality in severe traumatic brain injury,Charry J.; Falla J.; Ochoa J.; Pinzon M.; Tejada J.; Henriquez M.; Solano J.; Calvache C. ,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health problem. It is a pathology that causes significant mortality and disability in Colombia. Different calculators and prognostic models have been developed to predict the neurological outcomes of these patients. The Rotterdam computed tomography (CT) score was developed for prognostic purposes in TBI. We aimed to examine the accuracy of the prognostic discrimination and prediction of mortality of the Rotterdam CT score in a cohort of trauma patients with severe TBI in a university hospital in Colombia. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed 127 patients with severe TBI treated in a regional trauma center in Colombia over a 2-year period. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used. The discriminatory power of the score, its accuracy, and precision were assessed by logistic regression and as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Shapiro-Wilk, Chi-square, and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the real outcomes in the cohort against the predicted outcomes. Result(s): The median age of the patient cohort was 33 years, and 84.25% were male. The median injury severity score was 25, the median Glasgow Coma Scale motor score was 3, the basal cisterns were closed in 46.46% of the patients, and a midline shift of >5 mm was seen in 50.39%. The 6-month mortality was 29.13%, and the Rotterdam CT score predicted a mortality of 26% (P < 0.0001) (area under the curve: 0.825; 95% confidence interval: 0.745-0.903). Conclusion(s): The Rotterdam CT score predicted mortality at 6 months in patients with severe head trauma in a university hospital in Colombia.

"Comparison of glasgow coma scale, full outline of unresponsiveness and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation in prediction of mortality rate among patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to intensive care unit",Hosseini S.H.; Ayyasi M.; Akbari H.; Heidari Gorji M.A. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Choosing an appropriate diagnostic tool is critical in early stage for appropriate decision about primary diagnosis, medical care and prognosis. Objective(s): This study aimed to compare the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), full outline of unresponsiveness (FOUR) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) with respect to prediction of the mortality rate of patients with TBI admitted to intensive care unit. PatientsandMethods: This diagnostic study was conducted on 80 patients with TBI in educational hospitals. The scores of APACHE II, GCS and FOUR were recorded during the first 24 hours of admission of patients. In this study, early mortality means the patient death before 14 days and delayed mortality means the patient death 15 days after admitting to hospital. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inductive statistics. Result(s): The results showed that the mean age of the patients was 33.80 +/- 12.60. From a total of 80 patients with TBI, 16 (20%) were females and 64 (80%) males. The mortality rate was 15 (18.7%). The results showed no significant difference among three tools. In prediction of early mortality, the areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.92 (CI = 0.95. 0.81 - 0.97), 0.90 (CI = 0.95. 0.74 - 0.94), and 0.96 (CI = 0.95. 0.87 - 0.9) for FOUR, APACHE II and GCS, respectively. In delayed mortality, the AUCs were 0.89 (CI = 0.95. 0.81-0.94), 0.94 (CI = 0.95. 0.74 - 0.97) and 0.90 (CI = 0.95. 0.87 - 0.95) for FOUR, APACHE II and GCS, respectively. Conclusion(s): Considering that GCS is easy to use and the FOUR can diagnose a locking syndrome along same values of subscales. These two subscales are superior to APACHI II in prediction of early mortality.

Studies on the epidemiology and especially the prognosis of head trauma are rare in developing countries. The objective of our study is to determine the epidemiological aspects and to identify factors correlated with shortand long-term prognosis. Patients and methods It was a retrospective study during 4 years (January 2009-December 2012) included 694 patients with traumatic brain injury due to traffic accidents. We studied the factors correlated with poor prognosis in terms of death or Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in univariate and multivariate analysis. For study according to GOS, patients (n = 694) were divided in two groups: favorable GOS for patients having a good recovery or recovery with a minor handicap [GOS class 4 or5] and unfavorable GOS for patients having a severe handicap or vegetative state [GOS class 1or 2] or died [GOS1]. Results During the study period, 694 patients (18.7% of all patients) were admitted to our ICU with traumatic brain injury due to traffic accidents. The mean of age was 31.9. The sex ratio was 5.8. In admission, 20% of patients had hypotension, 17.4% of patients had respiratory distress and the mean GSC was 8.8. The mortality rate was 28.5%. 496 patients were survivor: 13 patients with vegetative state, 133 with severe handicap (19.3%), 185 patients with minor handicap (26.7%), and 163 patients with good recovery (23.6%). The predictive independent factors correlated to mortality in multivariate analysis were: age >=38, hypotension, hypoxemia, SGS <= 8, unilateral or bilateral mydriasis, cerebral edema, Marshall Class VI, initial hemoglobin <=11.3, Blood sugar >=8.3 mmol/l. The predictive factors correlated with poor prognosis according GOS were: age >=38, initial shock, SGC <= 8, unilateral or bilateral mydriasis, post traumatic coma duration more than 5 days, cerebral edema, initial hemoglobin <=11.7 g/dl, blood sugar >=8.4 mmol/l and catecholamine using.

Monitoring Intracranial pressure (ICP) in severe traumatic brain injury decreases mortality,Verma H.; Kamal R. ,"Objective: To evaluate the role of raised Intracranial pressure monitoring and early prognostic indicators of mortality in the management of Severe Traumatic brain injuries in adults. Background(s): Outcome of patients with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) depends on various factors, and most important among them is the raised Intracranial Pressure(ICP) and mean arterial pressure(MAP). Monitoring ICP and MAP correlates with degree of cerebrovascular reactivity(autoreguation). However, routine use of ICP monitoring in severe TBI continues to be subject of controversy inspite of recommendations from Brain Trauma foundation guideline. Design/Methods: All adult patients with severe TBI from Jan 2008 to April 2016 were included from single tertiary centre. Patients who died within 48 hours of admission were excluded. Severe TBI was defined as post resuscitation GCS score of 8 or less admitted to neurosurgical ICU. ICP-lowering treatment was given in 234 patients. ICP monitoring was done in 144 The and 90 were treated without monitoring. Two week mortality was assessed in these patients. Early prognostic indicators of mortality, including age, admission GCS score, pupillary status, CT scanning findings, and hypotension were also assessed. Result(s): Results; Eighty percent of severe TBI were young males. Hypotension was found in 19 percent of patients. On admission 130 patients had GCS of 5 or less, where as 104 patients had GCS between 6-8. Two weeks mortality was 21percent who underwent ICP monitoring as compared to 37 percent who were managed without monitoring. Lower GCS of 5 or less had higher two week mortality. Patients having persistent hypotension had significantly higher mortality of 68 percent. Conclusion(s): Conclusion; ICP-monitoring results in significantly lower mortality than in patients who were not ICP monitored. Lower GCS and Hypotension also contributed significantly in increasing mortality.",2017,/,Neurology,88,16 Supplement 1,,,,616550822,#22251,Verma 2017,,yes
The burden of elevated intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen over time after severe traumatic brain injury,Pahren L.; Ardakani H.D.; Smith M.; Hartings J.; Lee J.; Ngwenya L.; Foreman B. ,"Introduction The measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a cornerstone of intensive care management following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). It has been only recently that the time integral of ICP has been quantified in relation to outcome; the time integral of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) has not been studied. Methods We gathered time-locked intracranial monitoring data on s TBI patients at the University of Cincinnati over 2 years. Clinical management of all patients followed national standards. Raumedic PTO probe was used to measure ICP and PbtO2; accuracy was verified by visual inspection with automated data cleaning. Normalized data was mapped based on correlation with Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 3-6 months. Results We studied 43 patients aged 42+/-18 years (mean+/-SD); 84% were male. Initial post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score was median 6 (interquartile range: 4.5-7). 13/43 underwent craniectomy prior to monitoring. Among those with good (GOS4-5) and poor (GOS1-3) outcome, the average ICP was 13.2+/-5.6mmHg and 18.4+/-8.6mmHg (p=0.09); the average PbtO2 was 25.7+/-10.0mmHg and 31.1+/- 21.5mmHg (both N.S.). The correlation with outcome was dependent on both ICP and time: an ICP > 27mmHg for > 5 minutes was associated with poor outcome, whereas an ICP < 23mmHg was associated with poor outcome only after 4 hours. In contrast, the PbtO2 level, but not the duration, correlated with poor outcome in those without craniectomy at a PbtO2 < 30mmHg, and particularly below 12mmHg. PbtO2 burden was less reliable in those following craniectomy. Conclusions We replicated the effects of ICP/time in a cohort of patients with severe TBI, both with and without craniectomy and subsequently demonstrated the burden of brain tissue hypoxia in those without craniectomy. The time integral of multimodality monitoring data may provide more accurate measures of secondary insult burden with implications for clinical care and prognosis.",2017,/,Neurocritical Care,27,2 Supplement 1,S258,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0465-9,619001491,#22166,Pahren 2017,,yes
Intracranial pressure trajectories may inform outcome and be influenced by genetic (ABCC8) edemarelated polymorphisms in severe traumatic brain injury,Jha R.M.; Elmer J.; Zusman B.E.; Puccio A.M.; Okonkwo D.O.; Shutter L.A.; Wallisch J.S.; Conley Y.P.; Kochanek P.M. ,"Introduction ICP is dynamic and influenced by genetics, TBI injury complex and medical treatments. Existing studies use point intracranial-pressure measures for patient categorization. Critical information about clinically important temporal trends is thus potentially lost. ABCC8, encoding sulfonylurea-receptor-1 is a putative regulator of cerebral edema in TBI and other neurological diseases. We aimed to 1) define ICPtrajectories over time in patients with severe TBI, 2) determine whether ABCC8-polymorphisms associated with edema differed across ICP-trajectory groups and 3) whether ICP-trajectory groups predicted clinical outcome. Methods We included prospective observational data from 446 severe TBI patients (GCS< 8, 2001-2014) from a single center. Trajectories were modeled from hourly ICP measurements (hours 1-120 after ventriculostomy/monitor placement). We used Group Based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) incorporating clinically relevant time-invariant risk factor adjustment (age, sex, initial GCS score, emergent craniectomy, primary hemorrhage pattern). We employed censored-normal distributions and Bayesian Information Criteria to select best models. We compared 6-month outcomes and tag-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2237982, rs7105832) across ICP-trajectory groups. Results A 6-trajectory-group model best fit the data. ICP-trajectory groups 1 (8.42%) and 2 (21.78%) had older patients (48.64+/-2.98; 47.72+/-1.84 years) with consistently low ICPs. ICP-trajectory groups 5 (14.85%) and 6 (3.22%) contained younger patients (32.15+/-1.91; 39.38+/-4.17 years) with persistently high ICPs. These ICP-trajectory groups had worse outcomes than groups 3 (23.02%) and 4 (28.71%) with younger patients (35.64+/-1.55; 35.24+/-1.32) and intermittent ICP-spikes. 6-month Glasgow-Outcome-Scale scores (p=0.006) and Disability-Rating-Scale scores (p=0.001) were different across ICP-trajectory groups. Rs2237982 (p=0.035) but not rs7105832 (p=0.13) genotypes differed across ICP-trajectory groups. Conclusions We employed a novel dynamic ICP-classification approach to investigate patterns in TBI.

Use of the crash study prognosis calculator in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and a Glasgow coma scale score of 3 at presentation,Sadaka F.; Jadhav A.; Miller M.; Saifo A.; O'Brien J. ,"Introduction There is often a tendency to treat patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 on presentation less aggressively because of low expectations for a good outcome. Based on the CRASH trial database, a prognosis calculator has been developed for the prediction of outcome in TBI patients. Our aim was to investigate whether the CRASH calculator can be used for prognostication in patients with TBI and GCS of 3 on presentation. Methods We performed a retrospective review of patients with TBI and a GCS score of 3 from 1/12 to 9/16. The CRASH calculator has been validated to estimate mortality at 14 days and death and severe disability at six months (Glasgow Outcome Scale- GOS 1-3). The calculator uses country of origin (USA in our dataset), Age, GCS, pupils reactivity to light, presence of major extracranial injury, and findings on CT scan of brain (petechial hemorrhages, Obliteration of the third ventricle or basal cisterns, Subarachnoid bleeding, Midline shift, and Non-evacuated hematoma). The individual prognosis for mortality at 14 days and unfavourable outcome at 6 months was calculated and compared with the actual outcomes. Results A total of 62 patients were included. A tend toward underestimation of the risk of mortality at 14 days was found (Estimated mortality was 66 % compared to actual mortality of 81%; Difference of 15%, p = 0.05). However, the estimation of outcome at 6 months was accurate (Estimated GOS 1-3 was 85.5 % compared to actual of 85.5 %, p = 1.0). Conclusions The CRASH prognosis calculator underestimated the risk of mortality, but accurately predicted unfavourable 6 month outcome in patients with TBI and GCS of 3 on presentation. Pending larger studies to validate our findings, we believe that CRASH calculator can only support - not replace - clinical judgment.",2017,/,Neurocritical Care,27,2 Supplement 1,S60,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0465-9,619001629,#22158,Sadaka 2017,,yes
Patients with traumatic brain injury and a Glasgow coma scale score of 3 at presentation : An outcome study,Sadaka F.; Jadhav A.; Miller M.; Saifo A.; O'Brien J. ,"Introduction A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 on presentation in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) portends a poor prognosis. Consequently, there is often a tendency to treat these patients less aggressively because of low expectations for a good outcome. Methods We performed a retrospective review of patients with TBI and a GCS score of 3. Demographics, APACHE IV scores , pupillary reactivity to light, intracranial pressure (ICP), ICP burden (the number of days with an ICP spike >25 mm Hg as a percentage of the total number of days monitored), and outcome (Mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale-GOS at 6 months, with good outcome defined as GOS of 4-5). Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (GOS = 1-3) and Group 2 (GOS = 4-5). Results A total of 62 patients were included. The overall mortality rate was 80.6 %. At 6-month, 9 patients (14.5 %) achieved a GOS 4-5. Compared to Group 2 (n = 9), Group 1(n = 53) had higher average APACHE IV score (104 +/- 19 vs 89 +/- 27, p = 0.04), more patients with bilateral fixed pupils (59 % vs 22 %, p = 0.04), and higher ICP burden ( 50 +/- 34 vs 0 +/- 0, p = 0.0001). GOS Score 4-5 was achieved in 41% of patients presenting with bilateral reactive pupils versus 6.9 % of patients presenting with bilateral fixed pupils (p = 0.005). Conclusions 14.5 % of patients with TBI and a GCS of 3 at presentation achieved a good outcome at 6 months. APACHE IV scores, ICP burden, and pupillary reactivity were significant predictors of outcome. We believe that patients with severe TBI who present with a GCS of 3 should still be treated aggressively initially since a good outcome can be obtained in a significant proportion of patients.",2017,/,Neurocritical Care,27,2 Supplement 1,S87,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0465-9,619001944,#22154,Sadaka 2017,,yes
Regional asymmetry of acute quantitative EEG percent alpha variability is associated with chronic cortical and subcortical atrophy and clinical outcome after traumatic brain injury,Nguyen P.T.; Blanco M.B.; Lutkenhoff E.; Schnaker C.; McArthur D.; Monti M.; Vespa P.M. ,"Introduction Quantitative parameters derived from continuous EEG (cEEG) have been useful to understand evolution of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the impact on regional networks. These parameters are often interrogated at a global level rather than region-specific. The regional evaluation of quantitative EEG parameters may provide an objective assessment of regional network function, and be of predictive value for prognostication Methods Continuous EEG was performed in 54 patients with TBI, and MRI imaging was obtained during acute and chronic time points post injury (within 30 days and 6 months, respectively). The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) assessed clinical recovery at 6 months, with good recovery defined as GOSE score 5-8 and poor as GOSE score 1-4. Volumetric measurements of selected brain regions, both cortical and subcortical, were obtained at acute and chronic time points. Quantitative parameters derived from cEEG, such as percent alpha variability (PAV) and hemispheric symmetry, were calculated continuously and anatomically (frontal, temporal, occipital) through the acute hospitalization course. We hypothesized that persistent regional variation in alpha power post injury would lead to brain regionspecific atrophy and may predict outcome at 6 months Results Acute PAV within the first 48 hours post injury was poor in patients with poor outcome. In addition, patients with poor outcome had significantly more atrophy in the thalamus, hippocampus, and temporal and occipital lobes. Asymmetry of the hemisphere PAV values correlated with both brain atrophy and clinical outcome Conclusions Regional asymmetry of PAV within the first 48 hours post injury correlates with chronic brain atrophy and clinical outcome after TBI.",2017,/,Neurocritical Care,27,2 Supplement 1,S93,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0465-9,619001996,#22152,Nguyen 2017,,yes
"Diffuse axonal injury, epidemiology and functional prognosis in short and medium term",Touceda A.; Segura M.; Gallego I.; Menor E.M.; Rivas M.D.; Mosquera D. ,"INTRODUCTION.Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) constitutes a pathology with a low incidence, but with catastrophic results for the patient and society.There are very few studies in the literature that review its epidemiology and the prognosis of these patients.OBJECTIVES.To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with TBI and DAI confirmed in MRI, as well as their prognosis and functional assessment in the short and medium term.METHODS.Retrospective, descriptive study of patients suffering from TBI, admitted in ICU, over a four-year period (November 2011- November 2015).RESULTS.A total of 257 patients were included, 176 men (68.5%) and 81 women (31.5%).Of these, 108 were mild TBIs (42%), 56 moderate (21.8%) and 93 severe (36.2%).The most frequent mechanism was accidental falls (36.6%) followed by motorcycle traffic injury (16%).DAI was suspected with the initial CT in 21 cases, rising to 26 in patients admitted with poor neurological evolution, although it could be only confirmed by MRI in 13 of them (5.1%).The majority were severe, grade III (61.5%).As in the global TBI, it was more frequent in men (69.2%), although the mean age was lower (42.3 +/- 21.8 years) and secondary to high energy injuries, mainly car crashes (30.8%).Length of stay in ICU (28.3 +/- 22.2 days) and total hospital admission (52.7 +/- 43.5 days) were also longer.In 76.9% of the cases were severe TBI (10 patients), and were classified radiologically on a Marshal Scale of 2 (53.8%).The overall mortality with TBI was 28.1%, according to the APACHE II score at admission (mean 15.6 +/- 8.5).However, mortality in the subgroup of patients with DAI was lower, only in 7.7%, in those with radiological confirmation of the lesion, probably due to a selection bias, failing to consider those patients in whom If there was an initial suspicion and no MRI was performed (12 patients), which had a mortality rate of 66.7%.DAI was associated with a poor functional prognosis (assessed according to the GOS scale) at medium (6 months) and long term (more than 1 year), GOS <= 3 in 53.8% and 50% of cases respectively, with significant statistic association regarding the global of traumatic brain injuries, which is also corroborated in a longer stay in ICU and hospitalization.CONCLUSIONS.DAI is still a challenge from a diagnostic and therapeutic point of view within patients suffering from TBI, with a significant functional repercussion for the patient, severe deficits and major dependence in many cases, as well as important costs for the health system, due to prolonged stays in intensive care and hospital units, as we demonstrated in our series.Although the mortality observed in these patients is low, we believe that it may be explained by the underdiagnosis of LAD, either because of a low suspicion in the context of TBI, or because of the initial severity of the lesion and the short-term poor prognosis that prevents radiological confirmation in many cases.",2017,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,5,2 Supplement 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-017-0151-4,619044342,#22140,Touceda 2017,,yes
Prognostic analysis of pulmonary contusion in severe head trauma patients,Snouda S.; Hebaieb F.; Abbes M.F.; Kaddour M.; Ben Ghezala H. ,"INTRODUCTION. Severe head trauma is a common reason for patient's admission to the intensive care unit and it is the leading cause of death in young adults. The outcome of these patients depends on many factors such as cerebral hypoxia. Pulmonary contusion can cause an acute respiratory failure that aggravates head trauma. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the impact on morbidity and mortality of pulmonary contusion in patients admitted for severe head trauma. METHODS. This was a retrospective study performed in the emergency and intensive care department in the regional hospital of Zaghouan. The patients were recruited during 3 years, from January 2013 to December 2015. All adult patients admitted for severe head trauma (Glasgow coma score (GCS) <= 8) were included and evaluated by quantified injury severity scores including APACHE2, GCS, ISS, TISS. The diagnosis of pulmonary contusion was based on the history of blunt chest trauma and the appearance of four types of lesions on chest CT scans. Hospital length of stay, mortality rate, incidence of adverse events including pneumonia, ARDS and shock were recorder and compared into the tow groups (with or without pulmonary contusion). RESULTS. During the study period, 104 patients were included. The diagnosis of pulmonary contusion was retained in 34 patients (32.7%). The two groups were compared for age, genre, APACHE 2 and GCS. There was a significant difference in the ISS and TISS (p < 0.001). Patients with pulmonary contusion had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio (240 [range, 160-380]) vs. 430 [range, 210- 590]; p = 0.009); and significantly higher PaCO2 levels (43.5 mmHg [range, 38-52 mmHg] vs. 38 mmHg [range, 32-40 mmHg], p < 0.001). The number of cases of pneumothorax and hemothorax were significantly higher in the group of pulmonary contusion (p = 0.003, p = 0.021; respectively). Likewise, The occurrence of pneumonia and ARDS was significantly higher in the group of pulmonary contusion (p = 0.031, p = 0.023; respectively) with a shorter length of time between ICU admission and the occurrence of such complications; (6 days [range, 6-10 days]) vs. 13 days [range, 8- 16 days]; p = 0.024) and (6 days [range, 2-8 days]) vs. 10 days [range, 8-10 days]; p = 0.016), respectively. No significant difference was observed with regard to the number of cases of shock (p = 0.174). The length of hospital stay was significantly higher in the group of pulmonary contusion (13.44 +/- 6 days vs. 12.44 +/- 4 days; p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 11.5% in pulmonary contusion group and 7.7% in the other group (Odds ratio, 4.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.527 to 11.703; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. In this study, pulmonary contusion alters gas exchange and appears to increase the morbidity and mortality in patients with severe head trauma.",2017,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,5,2 Supplement 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-017-0151-4,619044640,#22137,Snouda 2017,,yes
Functional independence and long-term recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI),Jehan F.; Khan M.; Tang A.L.; Azim A.; O'Keeffe T.; Gries L.M.; Kulvatunyou N.; Joseph B. ,"INTRODUCTION: Functional prognosis after TBI is an important outcome and necessary guide for decision-making on part of treatment- team and family members. Aim of this study was to describe the functional independence of TBI patients after rehabilitation and the predictive value of clinical factors. METHOD(S): We performed a 2-year (2014 to 2015) analysis of our prospectively maintained TBI database and included adult TBI patients discharged to rehabilitation center. Functional independence measure (FIM) score was calculated at admission(FIMin) and discharge (FIMout) from rehabilitation center, and also Delta- FIM (FIMout - FIMin), and FIM gain (delta FIM/rehabilitation day). Patients were divided based on age: <= 65 years and >65 years. FIMout score of <=72 indicates severe disability while score of >90 indicates functional independence. Regression analysis was performed. RESULT(S): A total of 70 patients with TBI were enrolled. The mean age was 63+/-21 years and 57% were male. The median admission GCS score was 15[4-15]. The mean FIMin score was 57.6+/-16.9 while FIMout score was 100.8+/-13.9. 76% of the patients were functionally independent with FIMout score >90. FIM score was <=72 in 3% patients. The two age groups did not differ significantly on total FIMin or FIMout scores, nor on rehabilitation outcome as measured by delta FIM and FIM Gain. Hospital- LOS (p=0.01), CT-findings (skull fracture or frontal lobe injury) (p<0.001), and FIMin score (p=0.001) were independent predictors of FIMout score. Age (p=0.62) and admission GCS score (p=0.08) did not predict FIMout score. CONCLUSION(S): Long-term functional recovery after TBI is of paramount importance in goals of care. Utilization of these findings may help to set realistic long-term goals for functional recovery, regardless of age.",2017,/,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,225,4 Supplement 2,e179,,,619490081,#22111,Jehan 2017,,yes
Optimal cerebral perfusion pressure; Bedside application after severe traumatic brain injury,Donnelly J.; Aries M.; Czosnyka M.; Robba C.; Liu M.; Ercole A.; Menon D.; Hutchinson P.; Smielewski P. ,"Introduction: Previously, a cerebrovascular reactivity-based method that yields continuous estimates of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) has been developed using a TBI cohort. Using recent CPPopt data from patients after severe TBI, we aimed to assess the real-time clinical value of CPPopt by testing the hypothesis that bedside CPPopt data without artifact removal remains an independent determinant of patient outcome. Method(s): Single center cerebral monitoring data from severe TBI patients admitted between 2010 and 2015 were used. Treatment was guided by controlling absolute values of ICP and CPP. CPPopt was determined using a previously published curve-fitting protocol. No manual cleaning of signal artifacts was performed. The difference between current CPP and CPPopt, coupled with the current PRx value (with a threshold for impaired autoregulation (PRx) of +0.15), was used to determine whether each CPP was below the lower limit of reactivity (LLR), above the upper limit of reactivity (ULR) and within the reactivity limits. The time each patient spent below, above or within these reactivity limits was compared across GOS groups (Fig. 16). Result(s): ICP monitoring data from 231 patients were available. Time spent with CPP within reactivity limits or the time spent with CPP below the LLR were both associated with GOS, independent of age, GCS motor score, pupillary reactivity and mean ICP (OR for %time CPP below LLR = 0.96 (0.94-0.98), OR for %time CPP within reactivity limits = 1.03 (1.01-1.05).

Predictive value of common intensive care severity scores in traumatic brain injury,Kenawi M.; Kandil A.; Husein K.; Samir A. ,"Introduction: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) causes a severe toll on society as a leading cause of mortality worldwide and the major cause of disability among young adults. The prognosis after TBI had been particularly challenging to predict, with limited availability of robust prognostic models. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores compared to simpler models based on age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in predicting a six-month mortality of patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the intensive care unit (ICU). Method(s): A Prospective cohort study conducted on acute TBI patients admitted to I.C.U at EL-HELAL trauma Centre and KASR AL AINI university hospital, Egypt during the period from August 2014 to April 2015. All patients were followed-up for 6 months from the day of admission. Our patients were divided into two groups (survivors and non-survivors). Result(s): A total of 104 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 37 +/- 17.16 years, the overall six-month mortality was 25 patients (24.4%). The univariate analysis showed that APACHE II, SAPS II, SOFA, GCS, and age had a significant statistical difference regarding mortality between both groups (P-value < 0.05) and the optimal cut-off point as mortality indicator was 14, 26, 4, 9 and 49 respectively with area under the curve (AUC) 0.88, 0.87, 0.83, 0.80 and 0.79 respectively. By Multivariate analysis using logistic regression, we found only Age and GCS had a statistically significant impact on outcome (P-value; 0.001, 0.022). Conclusion(s): A simple prognostic model based only on GCS and Age displayed good predictor for six-month mortality of ICU treated patients with TBI. The use of the more complex scoring systems (APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA) added little to the prognostic performance.",2017,/,Critical Care,21,1 Supplement 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-017-1630-4,619526788,#22104,Kenawi 2017,,yes
Syndecan-1: A marker for traumatic brain injury induced acute coagulopathy and mortality,Albert V.; Subramaniana A.; Agrawal D.; Duttagupta S.; Mukhopadhyay A.K. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury results in the disruption and shedding of the glycocalyx, which leads to the release of specific components into circulation, causing exacerbated neurohumoral, inflammatory and coagulation activation. Objective(s): To investigate the pathophysiological relationships between glycocalyx disruption and acute coagulopathy in isolated severe TBI (iSTBI) patients by evaluating the levels of syndecan-1. To analyse the association of TBI associated endothelial glycocalyx destruction with mortality. Patients and Methods / Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational cohort, over a period of two years, following institute ethics committee approval.Syndecan-1 levels were analysed by ELISA on samples acquired <=12 hrs. of injury. Result(s): 120 iSTBI patients [average age 34.5+/-13.2 yrs.; 88.3% male; mean GCS 6.5+/-1.7] included, 41.%(50) developed TBI induced coagulopathy. Syndecan levels significantly elevated in coagulopathic compared to non-coagulopathic iSTBI patients [33.7(21.6-109.5) vs. 29.9(19.2-39.5); p0.03]. Overall mortality was 30% (36), of which 22 developed acute coagulopathy. Overall syndecan levels were elevated in non-survivors vs. survivors [41.4(30.3-142.3) vs. 23.7(19.2-43.2); p0.0001]. Syndecan levels were three times higher in non-survivors vs. survivors [79.5(30.5-160.5) vs. 22.1(19.9-66.7); p0.0007] in coagulopathic iSTBI patients. Logistic regression demonstrated high syndecan levels to be an independent predictor of acute coaguloapathy [OR 1.01(95% CI 0.69-0.96); p 0.008] and mortality among coagulopthic iSTBI (OR 1.02(95% CI 1.0-1.04); p 0.02) patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that subsequent to brain injury a high level of syndecan-1 is associated with impaired coagulation impaired, endothelial cell damage and increased mortality.

"[The effect of age, alcohol intoxication and type of brain injury on the prognosis of patients operated on for craniocerebral trauma].","Chrastina, J; Hrabovsky, D; Riha, I; Steinerova, K; Novak, Z","INTRODUCTION: Advanced age is reported to be an important negative prognostic factor for the final functional outcome in patients after craniocerebral injury. Worse prognosis can also be expected in the presence of significant brain contusion, requiring surgical treatment because of expansive behaviour. Definite adverse influence of alcohol intoxication at the time of injury has not been proven by current literature data. The aim of the study is to analyse the importance of the above mentioned factors for the treatment outcome in patients operated on for craniocerebral injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the group of 246 patients with craniocerebral injury operated on between 2007 and 2011, the authors focused on the influence of age (145 patients < 60 years, 101 patients > 60 years), alcohol intoxication at the moment of injury (blood alcohol level over 0.1% based mainly on serum osmolarity plus clinical signs of alcohol intoxication) and the presence of brain contusion requiring surgical decompression on the final clinical outcome (using the Glasgow Outcome Scale)., RESULTS: 54.1% of patients under 60 years of age were alcohol-intoxicated at the moment of injury. The incidence of alcohol intoxication in patients older than 60 years was 35.7%. The incidence of expansive brain contusions requiring surgical decompression was higher in patients older than 60 years and patients with alcohol intoxication. Statistical analysis of prognosis as related to age has shown significantly worse prognosis in patients older than 60 years. The difference was also significant in the subgroup of non-intoxicated patients. Statistical analysis did not show worse prognosis in alcohol-intoxicated patients. The presence of significant contusions influenced the injury prognosis only in patients younger than 60 years., CONCLUSION: The impact of age on the final treatment outcome in patients with craniocerebral injury was proven.

[Interest of S100B protein blood level determination in severe or moderate head injury].,"Bouvier, Damien","S100B, a suffering brain marker, exhibits a different interest in traumatic brain injury (TBI) as the trauma is severe (sTBI) or mild (mTBI). Our works presented for the attribution of the SFBC 2012 price talked about both aspects. Firstly, the extent of S100B elevation has been found to be useful in predicting clinical outcome after sTBI. However, few studies were realized with jugular venous blood samples. After comparing the interest between jugular venous and arterial blood concentrations evaluation of serum S100B protein in patients with sTBI, determination of S100B concentration in jugular blood samples appears to be better than in arterial ones to predict clinical outcome after brain injury. Secondly, it's difficult to determine the indication of cranial computed tomography (CCT) for patients with mTBI. Actually, 90% of patients with mTBI have unnecessary CCT or short hospitalization for observation. Serum concentrations of S100B were found to provide useful information. We have investigated in 2 studies (1 for adult, 1 for children) whether S100B concentrations in patients with mTBI could provide additional information to improve indication of the need for an initial CCT scan or for a short hospitalization. Patients with intracerebral lesions on the CCT scan (CCT+) or with bad clinical evolution were identified with a sensitivity level of 100% and a specificity level of 30%. Adding the measurement of S-100B serum concentration to the clinical decision rules for a CCT scan or hospitalization in patients with mTBI could allow a 30% reduction in scans and in hospitalization for clinical observation.",2013,/,Annales de biologie clinique,71,2,145-50,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1684/abc.2013.0812,23587577,#8287,Bouvier 2013,,yes
The prognostic significance of the serum biomarker heart-fatty acidic binding protein in comparison with s100b in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Walder, Bernhard; Robin, Xavier; Rebetez, Marie My Lien; Copin, Jean-Christophe; Gasche, Yvan; Sanchez, Jean-Charles; Turck, Natacha","The outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is largely unfavorable, with approximately two thirds of patients suffering from severe disabilities or dying during the first 6 months. Existing predictive models displayed only limited utility for outcome prediction in individual patients. Time courses of heart-fatty acidic binding protein (H-FABP) and their association with outcome were investigated and compared with S100b. Forty-nine consecutive patients with severe TBI (sTBI; Head component of the Abbreviated Injury Scale [HAIS] >3) with mono and multiple trauma were enrolled in this study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured blood concentrations of H-FABP and S100b at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after TBI. Outcome measures were conscious state at 14 days (Glasgow Coma Scale), disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended; GOSE), and mortality at 3 months. Univariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves analysis were carried out. Maximal H-FABP and S100b concentrations were observed at 6 h after TBI (34.4+/-34.0 and 0.64+/-0.99 ng/mL, respectively).

Acute neuro-endocrine profile and prediction of outcome after severe brain injury.,"Olivecrona, Zandra; Dahlqvist, Per; Koskinen, Lars-Owe D","OBJECT: The aim of the study was to evaluate the early changes in pituitary hormone levels after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and compare hormone levels to basic neuro-intensive care data, a systematic scoring of the CT-findings and to evaluate whether hormone changes are related to outcome., METHODS: Prospective study, including consecutive patients, 15-70 years, with sTBI, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <= 8, initial cerebral perfusion pressure > 10 mm Hg, and arrival to our level one trauma university hospital within 24 hours after head trauma (n = 48). Serum samples were collected in the morning (08-10 am) day 1 and day 4 after sTBI for analysis of cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (men). Serum for cortisol and GH was also obtained in the evening (17-19 pm) at day 1 and day 4. The first CT of the brain was classified according to Marshall. Independent staff evaluated outcome at 3 months using GOS-E., RESULTS: Profound changes were found for most pituitary-dependent hormones in the acute phase after sTBI, i.e. low levels of thyroid hormones, strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis and increased levels of prolactin. The main findings of this study were: 1) A large proportion (54% day 1 and 70% day 4) of the patients showed morning s-cortisol levels below the proposed cut-off levels for critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), i.e. <276 nmol/L (=10 ug/dL), 2) Low s-cortisol was not associated with higher mortality or worse outcome at 3 months, 3) There was a significant association between early (day 1) and strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis and improved survival and favorable functional outcome 3 months after sTBI, 4) Significantly lower levels of fT3 and TSH at day 4 in patients with a poor outcome at 3 months. 5) A higher Marshall CT score was associated with higher day 1 LH/FSH- and lower day 4 TSH levels 6) In general no significant correlation between GCS, ICP or CPP and hormone levels were detected. Only ICPmax and LH day 1 in men was significantly correlated., CONCLUSION: Profound dynamic changes in hormone levels are found in the acute phase of sTBI. This is consistent with previous findings in different groups of critically ill patients, most of which are likely to be attributed to physiological adaptation to acute illness. Low cortisol levels were a common finding, and not associated with unfavorable outcome. A retained ability to a dynamic hormonal response, i.e. fast and strong suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis (day 1) and ability to restore activity in the pituitary-thyroid axis (day 4) was associated with less severe injury according to CT-findings and favorable outcome.",2013,/,"Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",21,101477511,33,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1757-7241-21-33,23601250,#8281,Olivecrona 2013,,yes
Neurological outcome scale for traumatic brain injury: III. Criterion-related validity and sensitivity to change in the NABIS hypothermia-II clinical trial.,"McCauley, Stephen R; Wilde, Elisabeth A; Moretti, Paolo; Macleod, Marianne C; Pedroza, Claudia; Drever, Pamala; Fourwinds, Sierra; Frisby, Melisa L; Beers, Sue R; Scott, James N; Hunter, Jill V; Traipe, Elfrides; Valadka, Alex B; Okonkwo, David O; Zygun, David A; Puccio, Ava M; Clifton, Guy L","The neurological outcome scale for traumatic brain injury (NOS-TBI) is a measure assessing neurological functioning in patients with TBI. We hypothesized that the NOS-TBI would exhibit adequate concurrent and predictive validity and demonstrate more sensitivity to change, compared with other well-established outcome measures. We analyzed data from the National Acute Brain Injury Study: Hypothermia-II clinical trial. Participants were 16-45 years of age with severe TBI assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. For analysis of criterion-related validity (concurrent and predictive), Spearman's rank-order correlations were calculated between the NOS-TBI and the glasgow outcome scale (GOS), GOS-extended (GOS-E), disability rating scale (DRS), and neurobehavioral rating scale-revised (NRS-R). Concurrent validity was demonstrated through significant correlations between the NOS-TBI and GOS, GOS-E, DRS, and NRS-R measured contemporaneously at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury (all p<0.0013). For prediction analyses, the multiplicity-adjusted p value using the false discovery rate was <0.015. The 1-month NOS-TBI score was a significant predictor of outcome in the GOS, GOS-E, and DRS at 3 and 6 months postinjury (all p<0.015). The 3-month NOS-TBI significantly predicted GOS, GOS-E, DRS, and NRS-R outcomes at 6 and 12 months postinjury (all p<0.0015). Sensitivity to change was analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed rank-sum test of subsamples demonstrating no change in the GOS or GOS-E between 3 and 6 months. The NOS-TBI demonstrated higher sensitivity to change, compared with the GOS (p<0.038) and GOS-E (p<0.016). In summary, the NOS-TBI demonstrated adequate concurrent and predictive validity as well as sensitivity to change, compared with gold-standard outcome measures.

"Serum adhesion molecules, outcome and neuro-psychological function in acute traumatic brain injury patients.","Wang, Hung-Chen; Wang, Pei-Ming; Lin, Yu-Jun; Kwan, Aij-Lie; Lin, Wei-Che; Tsai, Nai-Wen; Cheng, Ben-Chung; Chang, Wen-Neng; Su, Ben Yu-Jih; Kung, Chia-Te; Lu, Cheng-Hsien","BACKGROUND: Serum concentrations of adhesion molecules may be associated with secondary brain injury after acute traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Blood samples of 68 patients admitted within 24h after TBI were obtained on admission and on Days 4 and 7 after TBI. Patients received neuro-psychological testing on discharge and at 3 months after TBI., RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with acute TBI had markedly increased sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 on presentation (p=0.002 and p=0.021, respectively), but markedly decreased sL-selectin and sE-selectin (p=0.009 and p<=0.001, respectively). Outcome was assessed upon discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Good outcome was defined as GOS >=4 and poor outcome as GOS <=3. Motor deficits on admission (p<=0.001), Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission (p=0.002), Injury Severity Score on admission (p=0.009), neuro-surgical intervention (p=0.004), post-traumatic seizure (p=0.04), and sVCAM-1 level on admission (p=0.033) were significant risk factors of outcome. A sVCAM-1 cut-off value of 752.5ng/ml on admission had 80.0% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity for predicting outcome., CONCLUSION: Serum adhesion molecules are not specific for predicting outcome in patients with TBI. However, higher mean levels of these molecules on admission may imply more severe inflammatory response causing secondary brain injury and worse neuro-psychological function. These molecules may be added as evaluation markers in clinical practice. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Neuropathology of prolonged unresponsive wakefulness syndrome after blunt head injury: review of 100 post-mortem cases.,"Jellinger, Kurt A","OBJECTIVES: Recently, 'unresponsive wakefulness syndrome' (UWS) was coined for challenging conditions previously termed vegetative state or apallic syndrome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a post-mortem series of 630 patients who sustained a blunt traumatic brain injury, 100 (59 men and 41 women, aged 5-86 years; 77% traffic accidents, 23% falls and others) showed various disorders of consciousness which were compared with neuropathology with focus on brainstem lesions., RESULTS: In the total autopsy series (n = 630), the incidence of cortical contusions, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and intracranial haemorrhages was 41, 55 and 73%, respectively, of diencephalic, hypothalamic and hippocampal lesions 62% each, brainstem lesions 92%. Clinical prognosis was related to the location and extent of brainstem damage. Lesions in central parts of the rostral brainstem, frequently associated with extensive DAI, allowed no recovery from coma or UWS (n = 67), which occurred only with damage to the dorso-lateral brainstem tegmentum or pontine basis (n = 33). Only two of 11 patients with minimally conscious state (MCS), in addition to haemorrhages (n = 4), contusions (n = 10) and DAI (n = 7), showed small lesions in dorsolateral pontine tegmentum or diffuse pontine gliosis., CONCLUSIONS: These and other data confirm the importance of the pattern and extent of brainstem damage for the prognosis of UWS, only small peripheral lesions in pontine tegmentum allowing progressive remission.",2013,/,Brain injury,27,08-Jul,917-23,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2013.793395,23758492,#8198,Jellinger 2013,,yes
ANAM4 TBI reaction time-based tests have prognostic utility for acute concussion.,"Norris, Jacob N; Carr, Walter; Herzig, Thomas; Labrie, D Walter; Sams, Richard","The Concussion Restoration Care Center has used the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics version 4 Traumatic Brain Injury (ANAM4 TBI) battery in clinical assessment of concussion. The study's aim is to evaluate the prognostic utility of the ANAM4 TBI. In 165 concussed active duty personnel (all ultimately returned to duty) seen and tested on the ANAM4 TBI on days 3 and 5 (median times) from their injury, Spearman's rho statistics showed that all performance subtests (at day 5) were associated with fewer days return-to-duty (RTD) time, whereas concussion history or age did not. Kruskal-Wallis statistics showed that ANAM4 TBI, loss of consciousness, and post-traumatic amnesia were associated with increased RTD time; ANAM4 TBI reaction time-based subtests, collectively, showed the largest effect sizes. A survival analysis using a Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the lowest 25% on the reaction time-based subtests had a median RTD time of 19 days, whereas those in the upper 25% had a median RTD time of approximately 7 days. Results indicate that until validated neurocognitive testing is introduced, the ANAM4 TBI battery, especially reaction time-based tests, has prognostic utility.

Models of mortality probability in severe traumatic brain injury: results of the modelling by the UK trauma registry.,"Lesko, Mehdi Moazzez; Jenks, Tom; Perel, Pablo; O'Brien, Sarah; Childs, Charmaine; Bouamra, Omar; Lecky, Fiona","Currently available prognostic models in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are derived from historical data sets or from heterogeneous data sets, depending upon the trauma care delivered. The objective of our study was to develop models to predict survival in a recent cohort of TBI patients within a relatively homogeneous trauma care system. Records of patients with brain injury were extracted from the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database. The relationship of the variables (i.e., age, Glasgow Coma Score [GCS], pupillary reactivity, Injury Severity Score [ISS], Computed Tomography [CT] classifications, classification of various intracranial pathologies, systolic and mean blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and the presence of extracranial injury) to survival at discharge were determined. Stepwise logistical regression analysis was performed to determine the best prognostic model. Two models were derived from data of 802 patients (models A and B). Age, GCS, pupillary reactivity, hypoxia, and brainstem injury are significant predictors in both. However, model A contains ISS in contrast to model B, which contains the presence of brain swelling and major extracranial injury instead. Both models have good predictive performance (model A: area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC]=0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95], Nagelkerke R(2), 0.62; model B: AUC=0.93 [95% CI: 0.91-0.95], Nagelkerke R(2): 0.63).

Outcome was estimated by using the criteria of the IMPACT model. Admission international normalized ratio (INR) and platelet count were used as markers of coagulation. Overall injury severity was categorized with the injury severity score (ISS). Variables were added to the calculated IMPACT risk, generating new models. Model performance was assessed by analyzing and comparing the area under the curve (AUC) of the models., RESULTS: For 342 included patients, 6-month mortality was 32% and unfavorable neurological outcome was 36%. Patients with a poor outcome had lower platelets and higher INR and ISS than those with good outcome (P < .001). The IMPACT model had an AUC of 0.85 for predicting mortality and 0.81 for neurological outcome. Addition of INR but not ISS or platelets to the IMPACT predicted risk improved the predictive validity for mortality ([INCREMENT]AUC 0.02, P = .034) but not neurological outcome ([INCREMENT]AUC 0.00, P = .401).

Long-term disability and survival in traumatic brain injury: results from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research Model Systems.,"Brooks, Jordan C; Strauss, David J; Shavelle, Robert M; Paculdo, David R; Hammond, Flora M; Harrison-Felix, Cynthia L","OBJECTIVES: To document long-term survival in 1-year survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI); to compare the use of the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and FIM as factors in the estimation of survival probabilities; and to investigate the effect of time since injury and secular trends in mortality., DESIGN: Cohort study of 1-year survivors of TBI followed up to 20 years postinjury. Statistical methods include standardized mortality ratio, Kaplan-Meier survival curve, proportional hazards regression, and person-year logistic regression., SETTING: Postdischarge from rehabilitation units., PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of persons (N=7228) who were admitted to a TBI Model Systems facility and survived at least 1 year postinjury. These persons contributed 32,505 person-years, with 537 deaths, over the 1989 to 2011 study period., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival., RESULTS: Survival was poorer than that of the general population (standardized mortality ratio=2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-2.3). Age, sex, and functional disability were significant risk factors for mortality (P<.001). FIM- and DRS-based proportional hazards survival models had comparable predictive performance (C index: .80 vs .80; Akaike information criterion: 11,005 vs 11,015). Time since injury and current calendar year were not significant predictors of long-term survival (both P>.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival prognosis in TBI depends on age, sex, and disability.

The following independent variables were used: Glasgow Coma Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale motor score, pupil reaction to light, blood glucose, respiratory distress, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, and lesions detectable on cranial computed tomography. Associations between independent and dependent variables (death or survival to discharge) were analyzed using the chi-square test and, for cells with expected values of <5, the Fisher exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated., RESULTS: Of 47 patients, 20 (42.6%) were aged >60 years and 32 (68.1%) were male. Parameters associated with higher mortality identified were: Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 (OR 47.25, 95% CI 6.26-483.3, p <0.001) and Glasgow Coma Scale motor score <= 3 (OR 28.00, 95% CI 4.20-220.2, p <0.001); absence of pupil reaction (OR = 8.40, 95% CI 1.20-73.35, p <0.001), respiratory distress (OR = 47.25, 95% CI 1.85-85.92, p <0.0014), blood glucose >8.8 mmol/L (OR = 7.26, CI 1.28-46.18, p <0.001), subdural hematoma (OR 20.25, 95% CI 3.55-136.65, p <0.001) and multiple injuries detected by cranial computed tomography (OR = 29.25, 95% CI 4.64-228.43, p <0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed value in Sancti Spiritus Province of the following for predicting mortality in head injury patients: Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8, Glasgow Coma Scale motor score <= 3, blood glucose >8.8 mmol/L, absence of pupil reaction to light, respiratory distress, and presence of multiple injuries detected in cranial computed tomography.

The plasma MEG3 in subjects was quantitatively analyzed via quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Moreover, the levels of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and IL-8] in plasma in each group were detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the correlation analysis was performed for the MEG3 expression level and inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with TBI. Patients were divided into high-expression MEG3 group and low-expression MEG3 group, high-level inflammatory cytokine group and low-level inflammatory cytokine group according to the median, followed by prognosis evaluation. The MEG3 expression level in TBI group was significantly decreased compared to that in control group, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma, including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8, were significantly higher than in control group., RESULTS: The results of the correlation analysis showed that the expression level of plasma MEG3 had a significantly negative correlation with the level of each inflammatory cytokine. The prognostic analysis revealed that the prognosis of patients with high MEG3 expression level and low inflammatory cytokine levels was good, while it was poor in patients with low MEG3 expression level and high inflammatory cytokine levels; the difference was significant. In patients with TBI, the expression level of plasma MEG3 is decreased, while the inflammatory cytokine levels are increased, and there is a significantly negative correlation between the two items., CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with high MEG3 expression level and low inflammatory cytokine levels is good so MEG3 and inflammatory cytokines can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of TBI, improving the prognosis of patients.",2019,/,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,23,10,4341-4347,,https://dx.doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201905_17940,31173307,#5147,Shao 2019,,yes

Design and rationale: This exploratory study assessed CSF NAA levels in the first four days after severe TBI, and correlated these findings with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and long-term outcomes at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. Methods: CSF was collected after passive drainage via an indwelling ventriculostomy placed as standard of care in a total of 28 people with severe TBI. NAA levels were assayed using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcomes Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Results: In this pilot study, better functional outcomes, assessed using the GOS and DRS, were found in individuals with lower acute CSF NAA levels after TBI. Key findings were that average NAA level was associated with GCS (p = .02), and GOS at 3 (p = .01), 6 (p = .04), 12 (p = .007), and 24 months (p = .002).

Testing a Multivariate Proteomic Panel for Traumatic Brain Injury Biomarker Discovery: A TRACK-TBI Pilot Study.,"Huie, J Russell; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Yue, John K; Sorani, Marco D; Puccio, Ava M; Okonkwo, David O; Manley, Geoffrey T; Ferguson, Adam R; TRACK-TBI Investigators","The complex and heterogeneous nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has rendered the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers elusive. A single acute biomarker may not be sufficient to categorize injury severity and/or predict outcome. Using multivariate dimension reduction analyses, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of a multi-analyte panel of proteins as an ensemble biomarker for TBI. Serum was collected within 24 h of injury in a cohort of 130 patients enrolled in the multi-center prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot (TRACK-TBI Pilot) study and run on an array that measured 72 proteins. Using unsupervised principal components analysis, we first identified the subset of protein changes accounting for the most variance across patients. This yielded a group of 21 proteins that reflected an inverse relationship between inflammatory cytokines and regulators of anti-inflammation, and generated an individual inflammatory profile score for each patient. We then tested the association between these scores and computed tomography (CT) findings at hospital admission, as well as their prognostic association with functional recovery at 3 and 6 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended), and cognitive recovery at 6 months (California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition) after injury. Inflammatory signatures were significantly increased in patients with positive CT findings, as well as in those who showed poor or incomplete recovery. Inflammation biomarker scores also showed significant sensitivity and specificity as a discriminator of these outcome measures (all areas under the curve [AUCs] >0.62).

The added prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic brain injury: The importance of traumatic axonal injury when performing ordinal logistic regression.,"Cicuendez, Marta; Castano-Leon, Ana; Ramos, Ana; Hilario, Amaya; Gomez, Pedro A; Lagares, Alfonso","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was performed to investigate the prognostic value of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in severe head trauma., METHODS: We attempted to determine whether any MR imaging findings of TAI could be related to prognosis in 264 patients with severe head trauma. We performed an ordinal logistic regression, adjusted for the prognostic factors according to the IMPACT studies, adding each MR feature related to prognosis one at a time. A new prognostic model was described by adding these MR features to the classic prognostic factors. The model was externally validated in a prospective series. Harrel's c-statistic and ordinal c-index (ORC) were calculated to measure its predictive accuracy., RESULTS: We found 178 patients with TAI lesions. Lesions in the basal ganglia/thalamus, corpus callosum (CC) and brain stem were associated with poor outcome (P < 0.01). The highest OR was for TAI lesions in the splenium (OR: 2.6) and brain stem dorsal lesions (OR: 3.1). We only found significant differences in outcome between haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic TAI lesions in the subgroup of patients with white matter and basal ganglia/thalamus lesions (P = 0.01). We obtained a superior discriminatory capacity by adding these MR findings to the previous prognostic model (Harrel's c-statistic 0.72 and ORC 0.7) in a prospective series of 93 patients., CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic model including MR findings maintained a superior discriminatory capacity than that obtained for the model with the classic prognostic factors alone.

Implications for long-term occupational integration (beyond 5 years) have rarely been studied., OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess long-term RTW and the associated factors after severe TBI., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of individuals 16 to 60 years old admitted to hospital after severe TBI from 2005 to 2009 and followed prospectively. Medical and occupational data were collected from medical files and by systematic telephone interview to assess outcome at a minimum of 6 years post-trauma. Factors associated with RTW were investigated by multivariable regression analysis, estimating prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A proportional hazards model was used to study RTW delay, estimating hazard ratios (HRs)., RESULTS: Among the 91 individuals included (mean [SD] age 28.5 [11.3] years; 79% male), 63.7% returned to work after a mean of about 20 months, and 57.1% were still working at the time of the survey. Factors significantly associated with RTW on multivariable analysis were higher educational level (adjusted PR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.03), absence of motor disability (adjusted PR, 1.82; 1.12 to 2.95) and behavioural disorder (adjusted PR, 1.26; 1.01 to 1.60), as well as disabled worker status (adjusted PR, 1.26; 1.01 to 1.60) (likelihood of the multivariate analysis model 53.1).

Comparison of two simple models for prediction of short term mortality in patients after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Rached, Mohamed A K B; Gaudet, John G; Delhumeau, Cecile; Walder, Bernhard","INTRODUCTION: The subscale motor score of Glasgow Coma Scale (msGCS) and the Abbreviated Injury Score of head region (HAIS) are validated prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim was to compare the prognostic performance of a HAIS-based prediction model including HAIS, pupil reactivity and age, and the reference prediction model including msGCS in emergency department (ED), pupil reactivity and age., METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective epidemiological study including patients after severe TBI (HAIS > 3) with follow-up from the time of accident until 14 days or earlier death was performed in Switzerland. Performance of prediction, based on accuracy of discrimination [area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC)], calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) and validity (bootstrapping with 2000 repetitions to correct) for optimism of the two prediction models were investigated. A non-inferiority approach was performed and an a priori threshold for important differences was established., RESULTS: The cohort included 808 patients [median age 56 {inter-quartile range (IQR) 33-71}, median motor part of GCS in ED 1 (1-6), abnormal pupil reactivity 29.0%] with a death rate of 29.7% at 14 days. The accuracy of discrimination was similar (AUROC HAIS-based prediction model: 0.839; AUROC msGCS-based prediction model: 0.826, difference of the 2 AUROC 0.013 (-0.007 to 0.037). A similar calibration was observed (Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 11.64, p = 0.168 vs. Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 8.66, p = 0.372). Internal validity of HAIS-based prediction model was high (optimism corrected AUROC: 0.837)., CONCLUSIONS: Performance of prediction for short-term mortality after severe TBI with HAIS-based prediction model was non-inferior to reference prediction model using msGCS as predictor.

Effects of Brain Temperature on the Outcome of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Prospective Observational Study.,"Weng, Wei-Ji; Yang, Chun; Huang, Xian-Jian; Zhang, Yong-Ming; Liu, Jin-Fang; Yao, Jie-Min; Zhang, Zi-Heng; Wu, Xue-Song; Mei, Tao; Zhang, Chuan-Dong; Jia, Jun; Shi, Xiao-Feng; Mao, Qing; Feng, Jun-Feng; Gao, Guo-Yi; Jiang, Ji-Yao","A prospective observational study collected temperature data from 51 patients in 11 neurosurgical centers and follow-up outcome information at 6 months in 49 patients. Brain temperature (Tbr) was measured directly by an intraventricular temperature sensor. Axillary temperature (Tax) and rectal temperature (Tre) were measured by electric thermometers. Tbr was 0.4 to 1.5degreeC higher than body temperature. Tre correlated well with the Tbr (coefficient: 0.7378; p < 0.05). Among all patients, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores on admission were significantly lower in the patients with post-operatively extreme peak temperature (Tpeak, < 37degreeC or >39degreeC in first 24 h) and major temperature variation (Tvari > 1degreeC in first 12 h; p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). Among the patients with no temperature intervention, the extreme Tpeak group showed a lower Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months (p < 0.05) with lower GCS scores on admission (p < 0.01), compared with the moderate Tpeak group. Remarkably, the major Tvari group showed significantly lower GOS-E scores (p < 0.05) with the same GCS scores as the minor Tvari group. Thus, Tre is the better candidate to estimate Tbr. Spontaneously extreme Tpeak in TBI represents both more serious injury on admission and worse prognosis, and Tvari might be used as a novel prognostic parameter in TBI. Brain temperature is therefore one of the critical indicators evaluating injury severity, prognostication, and monitoring in the management of TBI.

Predictive value of early MRI findings on neurocognitive and psychiatric outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Aldossary, Nasser M; Kotb, Mamdouh Ali; Kamal, Ahmed M","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major public health problem worldwide, particularly in the Middle East. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is commonly found in TBI. Although DAI can lead to physical and psychosocial disabilities, its prognostic value is still a matter of debate. Magnetic Resonance (MR) is more sensitive for detecting DAI lesions., OBJECTIVE: To identify the radiological and clinical factors associated with the functional capacity one year after the traumatic brain injury., METHODS: The study included 251 patients with severe head trauma for whom Brain MRI was done within one month after injury. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were collected during hospitalization. Neurocognitive and psychiatric evaluation were done one year thereafter., RESULTS: DAI was more frequent in our patients. Psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, and poor functional outcome were more common in patients with DAI especially those with cerebral hemisphere and brain stem lesion, and mixed lesions. Duration of post traumatic amnesia (DPTA), lost consciousness and hospital stay (DHS) as well as the volume of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) were associated with poor neurocognitive outcome. DPTA, and DAIV may be considered independent factors that could predict the neurocognitive outcome., CONCLUSION: MRI following traumatic brain injury yields important prognostic information, with several lesion patterns significantly associated with poor long-term neurocognitive and psychiatric outcomes.

Twenty-one healthy sex-, age-, and education-matched control subjects were recruited for the control group. Of the 21 patients with sTBI, 12 patients regained consciousness (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score >2) and 9 patients remained unconscious (GOS score <2). FC and ALFF values were measured in the DMN and compared between the groups. We further assessed and compared the FC and ALFF values in both groups., RESULTS: Patients with sTBI showed significantly decreased FC and ALFF values in the DMN. However, patients with a better prognosis showed a significant increase in FC and ALFF values in the DMN. The conscious subgroup showed significantly enhanced FC in the medial superior frontal gyrus, left temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and parietal cortex compared with the coma subgroup.

Is initial optic nerve sheath diameter prognostic of specific head injury in emergency departments?.,"Sonmez, Bedriye Muge; Temel, Emirhan; Iscanli, Murat Dogan; Yilmaz, Fevzi; Guloksuz, Ugur; Parlak, Selcuk; Uckun, Ozhan Merzuk","BACKGROUND: Emergency departments (EDs) are typically the first medical contact for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and early diagnosis and treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with neurotrauma primarily falls under the liability of emergency doctors. Monitoring ICP with optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) via tools has gained popularity among emergency service doctors. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of ONSD for specific head injury on initial cranial tomography., METHODS: CT scans of 176 patients with a known intracranial pathology were retrospectively analyzed and compared with normal control CTs of 182 patients presented to ED at the same time interval. The attending radiologist analyzed all initial brain CT scans and randomly sampled control CTs were similarly assessed by the second senior radiologist whom were blind to the patients' medical histories and circumstances of TBI at the time of measurement. ONSD was measured at a distance of 3 mm behind the eyeball, immediately below the sclera., RESULTS: Right ONSD value was significantly higher in patients with herniation and SAH (p = 0,024 and 0,028, respectively). Left ONSD values was at the level of statistical significance and mean ONSD values was significantly higher in patients with SAH (p = 0.05 and 0.026, respectively). Right-left-mean ONSD values were statistically higher in study group with bilateral lesions on brain CT (p < 0,001).

We discerned the impact of serum FGL2 on trauma severity and 30-day mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A total of 114 severe TBI patients were subjected to assessment of trauma severity using the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). Measurement of the serum concentrations of FGL2 was done. 114 matched control subjects for their age and sex were included for comparison of serum concentration of FGL2., RESULTS: The concentration of FGL2 was dramatically increased in the patients as compared with the control subjects. FGL2 concentration was inversely correlated with GCS score among the patients. The non-survivors within 30days exhibited substantially higher FGL2 concentrations than the alive. FGL2 concentrations discriminated the patients at risk of 30-day death with significantly high area under receiver operating characteristic curve. Serum FGL2 emerged as an independent predictor for mortality and overall survival at 30days after head trauma., CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGL2 is a promising biomarker for assessing the severity and prognosis in severe TBI.

Sex differences in cerebral perfusion changes after mild traumatic brain injury: Longitudinal investigation and correlation with outcome.,"Bai, Guanghui; Bai, Lijun; Cao, Jieli; Sun, Chuanzhu; Wang, Shan; Yin, Bo; Zhuang, Jinfei; Wang, Zhuonan; Gan, Shuoqiu; Niu, Xuan; Huang, Wenmin; Xu, Hui; Shao, Meihua; Yan, Zhihan; Zhang, Ming","Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is known to have marked developmental sex differences. We investigated whether gender differences exert modulatory effect on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) from both neuropsychological testing and brain CBF changes using a longitudinal design from acute stage to subacute 1month post-injury. Our results supported that cognitive information processing speed (IPS), as one of core cognitive impairments following mTBI, were at least partially independent from other self-reported syndromes, such as post concussive symptom and posttraumatic stress disorder, and that it can be selectively impaired in specific male mTBI individuals. The gender difference of this cognitive domain in healthy control attenuated following mTBI and only male patients showed impaired language fluency accompanying with increased CBF changes compared with male controls. The increased CBF in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can predict much worse cognitive IPS performance in male patients. In contrast, female patients with mTBI displayed no impairments on any neuropsychological performance, and female sex may be a protective factor against neuropsychological impairments. Moreover, the significant interaction effect of time and gender exhibited in the left inferior frontal cortex (Broca's area). Simple effect test suggested gender differences in this area was mainly derived from the patients group at later subacute but not acute phase, for the reduced CBF at subacute mainly in the male patients. Thus, the current findings suggest that regional CBF may provide an objective biomarker for tracking gender modulatory effect on mTBI and its potentially pathological recovery process.

With the development of standardized continuous electroencephalography terminology, we aimed to describe the prevalence and burden of ictal-interictal patterns, including electrographic seizures after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury and to correlate continuous electroencephalography features with functional outcome., DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of the prospective, randomized controlled phase 2 multicenter INTREPID study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00805818). Continuous electroencephalography was initiated upon admission to the ICU. The primary outcome was the 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Consensus electroencephalography reviews were performed by raters certified in standardized continuous electroencephalography terminology blinded to clinical data. Rhythmic, periodic, or ictal patterns were referred to as ""ictal-interictal continuum""; severe ictal-interictal continuum was defined as greater than or equal to 1.5 Hz lateralized rhythmic delta activity or generalized periodic discharges and any lateralized periodic discharges or electrographic seizures., SETTING: Twenty U.S. level I trauma centers., PATIENTS: Patients with nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury and postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4-12 were included., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 152 patients with continuous electroencephalography (age 34 +/- 14 yr; 88% male), 22 (14%) had severe ictal-interictal continuum including electrographic seizures in four (2.6%). Severe ictal-interictal continuum burden correlated with initial prognostic scores, including the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (r = 0.51; p = 0.01) and Injury Severity Score (r = 0.49; p = 0.01), but not with functional outcome.

IMPACT probability of poor outcome and plasma cytokine concentrations are associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following traumatic brain injury.,"Lee, Sungho; Hwang, Hyunsoo; Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Goodman, J Clay; Aisiku, Imoigele P; Gopinath, Shankar; Robertson, Claudia S","OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs frequently after TBI and independently worsens outcome. The present study aimed to identify potential admission characteristics associated with post-TBI MODS., METHODS: The authors performed a secondary analysis of a recent randomized clinical trial studying the effects of erythropoietin and blood transfusion threshold on neurological recovery after TBI. Admission clinical, demographic, laboratory, and imaging parameters were used in a multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify independent risk factors for MODS following TBI, defined as maximum total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score > 7 within 10 days of TBI., RESULTS: Two hundred patients were initially recruited and 166 were included in the final analysis. Respiratory dysfunction was the most common nonneurological organ system dysfunction, occurring in 62% of the patients.

Prehospital on-scene anaesthetist treating severe traumatic brain injury patients is associated with lower mortality and better neurological outcome.,"Pakkanen, Toni; Nurmi, Jouni; Huhtala, Heini; Silfvast, Tom","BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) are likely to benefit from effective prehospital care to prevent secondary brain injury. Only a few studies have focused on the impact of advanced interventions in TBI patients by prehospital physicians. The primary end-point of this study was to assess the possible effect of an on-scene anaesthetist on mortality of TBI patients. A secondary end-point was the neurological outcome of these patients., METHODS: Patients with severe TBI (defined as a head injury resulting in a Glasgow Coma Score of <=8) from 2005 to 2010 and 2012-2015 in two study locations were determined. Isolated TBI patients transported directly from the accident scene to the university hospital were included. A modified six-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was defined as death, unfavourable outcome (GOS 2-3) and favourable outcome (GOS 4-5) and used to assess the neurological outcomes. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict mortality and good neurological outcome. The following prognostic variables for TBI were available in the prehospital setting: age, on-scene GCS, hypoxia and hypotension. As per the hypothesis that treatment provided by an on-scene anaesthetist would be beneficial to TBI outcomes, physician was added as a potential predictive factor with regard to the prognosis., RESULTS: The mortality data for 651 patients and neurological outcome data for 634 patients were available for primary and secondary analysis.

"Association of Very Early Serum Levels of S100B, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase-L1, and Spectrin Breakdown Product with Outcome in ProTECT III.","Frankel, Michael; Fan, Liqiong; Yeatts, Sharon D; Jeromin, Andreas; Vos, Pieter E; Wagner, Amy K; Wolf, Bethany J; Pauls, Qi; Lunney, Michael; Merck, Lisa H; Hall, Casey L; Palesch, Yuko Y; Silbergleit, Robert; Wright, David W","Rapid risk-stratification of patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) would inform management decisions and prognostication. The objective of this serum biomarker study (Biomarkers of Injury and Outcome [BIO]-Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment [ProTECT]) was to test the hypothesis that serum biomarkers of structural brain injury, measured at a single, very early time-point, add value beyond relevant clinical covariates when predicting unfavorable outcome 6 months after moderate-to-severe acute TBI. BIO-ProTECT utilized prospectively collected samples obtained from subjects with moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the ProTECT III clinical trial of progesterone. Serum samples were obtained within 4 h after injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B, alphaII-spectrin breakdown product of molecular weight 150 (SBDP150), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) were measured. The association between log-transformed biomarker levels and poor outcome, defined by a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score of 1-4 at 6 months post-injury, were estimated via logistic regression. Prognostic models and a biomarker risk score were developed using bootstrapping techniques. Of 882 ProTECT III subjects, samples were available for 566. Each biomarker was associated with 6-month GOS-E (p < 0.001). Compared with a model containing baseline patient variables/characteristics, inclusion of S100B and GFAP significantly improved prognostic capacity (p <= 0.05 both comparisons); conversely, UCH-L1 and SBDP did not. A final predictive model incorporating baseline patient variables/characteristics and biomarker data (S100B and GFAP) had the best prognostic capability (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: CI 0.81-0.89).

Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine whether MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels during the first week of a severe TBI could be used as biomarker predictive of mortality., METHODS: We included patients with severe TBI (defined as Glasgow Coma Scale lower than 9), and with Injury Severity Score in non-cranial aspects lower than 9. We determined serum concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 at days 1, 4 and 8 of TBI., RESULTS: TIMP-1 concentrations at days 1 (p<.001), 4 (p=.001), and 8 (p=.01) of TBI were higher in non-surviving (n=34) than in surviving (n=90) patients.

Functional Status Examination versus Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended as Outcome Measures in Traumatic Brain Injuries: How Do They Compare?.,"Dikmen, Sureyya; Machamer, Joan; Manley, Geoffrey T; Yuh, Esther L; Nelson, Lindsay D; Temkin, Nancy R; TRACK-TBI Investigators","Outcome measures are essential components of natural history studies of recovery and treatment effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and its revised version, the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), are well accepted and widely used for both observational and intervention studies, but there are concerns about their psychometric properties and aptness as outcome measures for TBI. The present study compares the Functional Status Examination (FSE) with the GOSE to assess outcome after TBI in a sample of 533 participants with TBI from the Magnesium Sulfate study and the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study by evaluating the sensitivity of each measure to severity of brain injury and recovery of function over time. The results indicate that both measures are strongly correlated with TBI severity. At three months, the correlation strengths between injury severity and each outcome measure do not differ (p = 0.88 for Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], p = 0.13 for computed tomography [CT] abnormalities) but at six months, the FSE is more strongly related to TBI severity indices than is the GOSE (p = 0.045 for GCS, p = 0.014 for CT abnormalities). In addition, the FSE generally shows significantly more improvement over time than the GOSE (p < 0.001). Detailed, structured administration rules and a wider score range of the FSE likely yields more sensitive and precise assessment of functional level than the GOSE. The FSE may be a valuable alternative to the GOSE for assessing functional outcome after TBI.",2019,/,Journal of neurotrauma,36,16,2423-2429,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6198,30827167,#5258,Dikmen 2019,,yes

Predictors of Outcome After Traumatic Brain Injuries: Experience of a Tertiary Health Care Institution in Northwest India.,"Khan, Khursheed Alam; Choudhary, Madhur; Sinha, Virendra D; Gora, Nandkishore; Bairwa, Mohan","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health issue in developing nations such as India along with underreporting of TBI data because of a lack of major studies targeting the population with TBI. Various lacunae from field to tertiary centers are responsible for this significant burden of TBIs. We studied the epidemiologic profile of 1150 patients with TBI including the predictors of the outcome of TBIs in a tertiary health care institution in North India to identify the modifiable factors that could be used to improve the outcome and reduce the TBI burden., METHODS: Patients presenting with TBI to a level I trauma center were identified and enrolled in the study. Data regarding patient information from accident to discharge or death were collected as per designed format and analyzed to determine outcome predictors., RESULTS: Mean age was 36 +/- 15.8 years and 84.6% of patients were male; road traffic accident was the mode of injury in 64.26% of cases. Lack of adequate prehospital care was seen in our study. Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, Injury Severity Score, and Rotterdam CT score were found to be the 3 statistically significant predictors of outcome in patients with TBI., CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about the causes, pattern, and distribution of patients with TBI from this study is helpful in policy making, research, health management, and rehabilitation at the national level in ours and in other nations.

BSRs were recorded 14 days after Traumatic brain injury, and classified into 3 grades. Predictors including BSRs, age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and cause of injury were also analyzed, respectively. The outcome was divided into 2 groups including unconscious group and minimally conscious state (MCS) group., RESULTS: Seventy-two of 120 were minimally conscious and 48 of 120 were unconscious at 6 months from the onset of injury. The BSRs outmatched the predictive accuracy of the GCS for outcome (AUROC, 0.853; 95% confidence interval, 0.753-0.953; and AUROC, 0.655; 95% confidence interval, 0.512-0.799, respectively).

Injury-specific variables improve risk adjustment and hospital quality assessment in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Dawes, Aaron J; Sacks, Greg D; Needleman, Jack; Brook, Robert H; Mittman, Brian S; Ko, Clifford Y; Cryer, H Gill; Los Angeles County Trauma Consortium","BACKGROUND: Hospital benchmarking is essential to quality improvement, but its usefulness depends on the ability of statistical models to adequately control for inter-hospital differences in patient mix. We explored whether the addition of injury-specific clinical variables to the current American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) algorithm would improve model fit., METHODS: We analyzed a prospective registry containing all adult patients who presented to a regional consortium of 14 trauma centers between 2010 and 2011 with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We used hierarchical logistic regression and stepwise forward selection to develop two novel risk-adjustment models. We then tested our novel models against the current TQIP model and ranked hospitals by their risk-adjusted mortality rates under each model to determine how model selection affects quality benchmarking., RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Stepwise selection resulted in two distinct models: one that added three TBI-specific variables (pupil reactivity, cerebral edema, loss of basal cisterns) to the model specification currently used by TQIP and another that combined two TBI-specific variables (pupil reactivity, cerebral edema) with a three-variable subset of TQIP (age, Abbreviated Injury Scale score for the head region, Glasgow Coma Scale motor score). Both novel models outperformed TQIP. Although rankings remained largely unchanged across model configurations, several hospitals moved across quality terciles., CONCLUSION: The inclusion of injury-specific variables improves risk adjustment for patients with severe TBI.

Description of the predictors of persistent post-concussion symptoms and disability after mild traumatic brain injury: the SHEFBIT cohort.,"Booker, James; Sinha, Saurabh; Choudhari, Kishor; Dawson, Jeremy; Singh, Rajiv","Introduction: Several patients who suffer Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) develop Persistent Post-Concussion Symptoms (PPCS) and long-term disability. Current prognostic models for mTBI have a large unexplained variance, which limits their use in a clinical setting. Aim: This study aimed to identify background demographics and mTBI details that are associated with PPCS and long-term disability. Methods: Patients from the SHEFfield Brain Injury after Trauma (SHEFBIT) cohort with mTBI in the Emergency Department (ED) were analysed as part of the study. PPCS and long-term disability were measured using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire and the Rivermead Post-Injury Follow-up Questionnaire respectively, during follow up brain injury clinics. Results: A representative mTBI sample of 647 patients was recruited with a follow-up rate of 89%. Non-attenders were older (p < 0.001), a greater proportion were retired (p < 0.001) and had a greater burden of comorbidity (p = 0.009). Multivariate analysis identified that female gender, previous psychiatric history, GCS <15, aetiology of assault and alcohol intoxication, were associated with worse recovery.

Clinical outcome and prognostic factors in elderly traumatic brain injury patients receiving neurointensive care.,"Lenell, Samuel; Nyholm, Lena; Lewen, Anders; Enblad, Per","BACKGROUND: The probability of favorable outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) decreases with age. Elderly, >= 60 years, are an increasing part of our population. Recent studies have shown an increase of favorable outcome in elderly over time. However, the optimal patient selection and neurointensive care (NIC) treatments may differ in the elderly and the young. The aims of this study were to examine outcome in a larger group of elderly TBI patients receiving NIC and to identify demographic and treatment related prognostic factors., METHODS: Patients with TBI >= 60 years receiving NIC at our department between 2008 and 2014 were included. Demographics, co-morbidity, admission characteristics, and type of treatments were collected. Clinical outcome at around 6 months was assessed. Potential prognostic factors were included in univariate and multivariate regression analysis with favorable outcome as dependent variable., RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients with mean age 70 years (median 69; range 60-87) were studied. Overall, favorable outcome was 46% (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) 5-8), unfavorable outcome 27% (GOSE 2-4), and mortality 27% (GOSE 1). Significant independent negative prognostic variables were high age (p < 0.05), multiple injuries (p < 0.05), GCS M <= 3 on admission (p < 0.05), and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the elderly TBI patients > 60 years receiving modern NIC in this study had a fair chance of favorable outcome without large risks for severe deficits and vegetative state, also in patients over 75 years of age.

Dynamics of extracellular matrix proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and serum and their relation to clinical outcome in human traumatic brain injury.,"Minta, Karolina; Cullen, Nicholas C; Nimer, Faiez Al; Thelin, Eric P; Piehl, Fredrik; Clarin, Marcus; Tullberg, Mats; Jeppsson, Anna; Portelius, Erik; Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj; Andreasson, Ulf","Background Brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R are extracellular matrix proteins present in brain that show increased expression in experimental animal models of brain injury. However, little is known about the dynamics of these proteins in human body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aims of this study were to investigate if matrix proteins in CSF and serum are associated with functional outcome following traumatic brain injury, if their concentrations change over time and to compare their levels between brain injured patients to controls. Methods In total, 42 traumatic brain injury patients, nine healthy controls and a contrast group consisting of 38 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients were included. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure the concentrations of proteins. Results Increased concentrations of brevican, tenascin-C and tenascin-R in CSF correlated with unfavourable outcome, with stronger outcome prediction ability compared to other biomarkers of brain tissue injury. CSF brevican, tenascin-R and serum neurocan gradually decreased with time (p = 0.04, p = 0.008, p = 0.005, respectively), while serum tenascin-C (p = 0.01) increased. CSF concentrations of brevican, neurocan and tenascin-R (only in time point 3) after TBI were lower than in the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.0008, respectively). In serum, tenascin-C concentration was higher and neurocan lower compared to healthy controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.0009).

Serum soluble TWEAK levels in severe traumatic brain injury and its prognostic significance.,"Tang, Bei; Zhong, Ze; Qiu, Zheng; Wu, Hui-Ping; Hu, Jia-Yuan; Ma, Jian-Ping; Wu, Jin-Ping","BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is characterized by a high mortality. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) participates in inflammation. We determined serum soluble TWEAK (sTWEAK) levels with respect to its prognostic ability., METHODS: This was a single-center prospective, observational study that was performed from December 2014 to December 2017. A total of 114 sTBI patients who met the inclusion criteria and 114 randomly selected healthy controls were included in the study. Serum sTWEAK levels were gauged. Patients were followed-up until death or completion of 6months. Poor outcome was referred to as Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3., RESULTS: In comparison with controls, patients displayed predominantly higher serum sTWEAK levels. Serum sTWEAK levels were strongly correlated with Glasgow coma scale scores and serum C-reactive protein levels. 32 patients (28.1%) died and 60 patients (52.6%) suffered from a poor outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis clearly showed that serum sTWEAK levels had substantially high predictive performance for 6-month mortality and poor outcome. Serum sTWEAK emerged as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality, overall survival and poor outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Raised serum sTWEAK levels are closely related to increasing inflammatory response, elevated trauma severity and worse clinical outcome after sTBI.

Acute alcohol intoxication and long-term outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Raj, Rahul; Skrifvars, Markus B; Kivisaari, Riku; Hernesniemi, Juha; Lappalainen, Jaakko; Siironen, Jari","The effect of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is controversial. We sought to assess the independent effect of positive BAC on long-term outcome in patients with TBI treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of 405 patients with TBI, admitted to the ICU of a large urban Level 1 trauma center between January 2009 and December 2012. Outcome was six-month mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome (defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1 [death], 2, [vegetative state], or 3 [severe disability]). Patients were categorized by admission BAC into: no BAC (0.0; n=99), low BAC (<2.3; n=140) and high BAC (>=2.3; n=166). Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline risk and severity of illness, was used to assess the independent effect of BAC on outcome (using the no BAC group as the reference). Overall six-month mortality was 25% and unfavorable outcome was 46%. Multivariate analysis showed low BAC to independently reduce risk of six-month mortality compared with no BAC (low BAC adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.88, p=0.021) and high BAC (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.29-1.15, p=0.120). Furthermore, a trend towards reduced risk of six-month unfavorable neurological outcome for patients with positive BAC, compared to patients with negative BAC, was noted, although this did not reach statistical significance (low BAC AOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34-1.22, p=0.178, and high BAC AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32-1.09, p=0.089). In conclusion, low admission BAC (<2.3) was found to independently reduce risk of six-month mortality for patients with TBI, and a trend towards improved long-term neurological outcome was found for BAC-positive patients.

Quantitative lobar cerebral blood flow for outcome prediction after traumatic brain injury.,"Fridley, Jared; Robertson, Claudia; Gopinath, Shankar","The aim of this study was to examine cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and determine whether lobar cortical CBF is a better predictor of long-term neurological outcome assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) than global cortical CBF. Ninety-eight patients with TBI had a stable xenon computed tomography scan (Xe/CT-CBF study) performed at various time points after their initial injury. Spearman's correlation coefficients and Kruskall-Wallis' test were used to examine the relationship between patient age, emergency room Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score, prehospital hypotension, prehospital hypoxia, mechanism of injury, type of injury, side of injury, global average CBF, lobar CBF, number of lobes with CBF below normal, and GOS (discharge, 3 and 6 months). Univariate ordinal regression was performed using these same variables and in combination with principle component analysis (PCA) to determine independent variables for multi-variate ordinal regression. Significant correlation between age, GCS, prehospital hypotension, type of injury, global average CBF, lobar CBF, number of lobes below normal CBF, and GOS was found. Individual lobar CBF was highly correlated with global CBF and the number of lobes below normal CBF. PCA found one principle component among these three CBF variables; therefore, average global CBF and number of lobes with CBF below normal were each chosen as independent variables for multiple ordinal regression, which found age, GCS, and prehospital hypotension, global average CBF, and number of lobes below normal CBF significantly associated with GOS. This study found global average CBF and lobar CBF significantly correlated with GOS at follow-up. There was, however, no individual cerebral lobe that was more predictive than any other, which puts into question the value of calculating lobar CBF versus global CBF in predicting GOS.",2015,/,Journal of neurotrauma,32,2,75-82,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2014.3350,25019579,#7461,Fridley 2015,,yes
Outcome prediction after mild and complicated mild traumatic brain injury: external validation of existing models and identification of new predictors using the TRACK-TBI pilot study.,"Lingsma, Hester F; Yue, John K; Maas, Andrew I R; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Manley, Geoffrey T; TRACK-TBI Investigators","Although the majority of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) recover completely, some still suffer from disabling ailments at 3 or 6 months. We validated existing prognostic models for mTBI and explored predictors of poor outcome after mTBI. We selected patients with mTBI from TRACK-TBI Pilot, an unselected observational cohort of TBI patients from three centers in the United States. We validated two prognostic models for the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) at 6 months after injury. One model was based on the CRASH study data and another from Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Possible predictors of 3- and 6-month GOS-E were analyzed with univariate and multi-variable proportional odds regression models. Of the 386 of 485 patients included in the study (median age, 44 years; interquartile range, 27-58), 75% (n=290) presented with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. In this mTBI population, both previously developed models had a poor performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.49-0.56). In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictors of lower 3- and 6-month GOS-E were older age, pre-existing psychiatric conditions, and lower education.

Low serum ficolin-3 levels are associated with severity and poor outcome in traumatic brain injury.,"Pan, Jian-Wei; Gao, Xiong-Wei; Jiang, Hao; Li, Ya-Feng; Xiao, Feng; Zhan, Ren-Ya","BACKGROUND: Ficolin-mediated activation of the lectin pathway of complement contributes to the complement-independent inflammatory processes of traumatic brain injury. Lower serum ficolin-3 levels have been demonstrated to be highly associated with unfavorable outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective observatory study was designed to investigate the relationships between serum ficolin-3 levels and injury severity and clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: Serum ficolin-3 levels of 128 patients and 128 healthy controls were measured by sandwich immunoassays. An unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3. Study endpoints included mortality at 1 week and 6 months and unfavorable outcome at 6 months after head trauma. Injury severity was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale score. Multivariate logistic models were structured to evaluate the relationships between serum ficolin-3 levels and study endpoints and injury severity., RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, serum ficolin-3 levels on admission were statistically decreased in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Serum ficolin-3 levels were independently correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Ficolin-3 was also identified as an independent prognostic predictor for 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality, and 6-month unfavorable outcome. Under receiver operating characteristics curves, ficolin-3 has similar prognostic predictive values for all study endpoints compared with Glasgow Coma Scale scores., CONCLUSIONS: It was proposed that lower serum ficolin-3 levels, correlated with injury severity, had the potential to be the useful, complementary tool to predict short- or long-term clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.",2015,/,Journal of neuroinflammation,12,101222974,226,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0444-z,26627059,#7005,Pan 2015,,yes
Mortality and One-Year Functional Outcome in Elderly and Very Old Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injuries: Observed and Predicted.,"Roe, Cecilie; Skandsen, Toril; Manskow, Unn; Ader, Tiina; Anke, Audny","The aim of the present study was to evaluate mortality and functional outcome in old and very old patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and compare to the predicted outcome according to the internet based CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head injury) model based prediction, from the Medical Research Council (MRC). Methods. Prospective, national multicenter study including patients with severe TBI >= 65 years. Predicted mortality and outcome were calculated based on clinical information (CRASH basic) (age, GCS score, and pupil reactivity to light), as well as with additional CT findings (CRASH CT). Observed 14-day mortality and favorable/unfavorable outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at one year was compared to the predicted outcome according to the CRASH models. Results . 97 patients, mean age 75 (SD 7) years, 64% men, were included. Two patients were lost to follow-up; 48 died within 14 days. The predicted versus the observed odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.65. Unfavorable outcome (GOSE < 5) was observed at one year follow-up in 72% of patients.

Short pressure reactivity index versus long pressure reactivity index in the management of traumatic brain injury.,"Lang, Erhard W; Kasprowicz, Magdalena; Smielewski, Peter; Santos, Edgar; Pickard, John; Czosnyka, Marek","OBJECT: The pressure reactivity index (PRx) correlates with outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is used to calculate optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt). The PRx is a correlation coefficient between slow, spontaneous changes (0.003-0.05 Hz) in intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial blood pressure (ABP). A novel index-the so-called long PRx (L-PRx)-that considers ABP and ICP changes (0.0008-0.008 Hz) was proposed., METHODS: The authors compared PRx and L-PRx for 6-month outcome prediction and CPPopt calculation in 307 patients with TBI. The PRx- and L-PRx-based CPPopt were determined and the predictive power and discriminant abilities were compared., RESULTS: The PRx and L-PRx correlation was good (R = 0.7, p < 0.00001; Spearman test). The PRx, age, CPP, and Glasgow Coma Scale score but not L-PRx were significant fatal outcome predictors (death and persistent vegetative state). There was a significant difference between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves calculated for PRx and L-PRx (0.61 +/- 0.04 vs 0.51 +/- 0.04; z-statistic = -3.26, p = 0.011), which indicates a better ability by PRx than L-PRx to predict fatal outcome. The CPPopt was higher for L-PRx than for PRx, without a statistical difference (median CPPopt for L-PRx: 76.9 mm Hg, interquartile range [IQR] +/- 10.1 mm Hg; median CPPopt for PRx: 74.7 mm Hg, IQR +/- 8.2 mm Hg). Death was associated with CPP below CPPopt for PRx (chi(2) = 30.6, p < 0.00001), and severe disability was associated with CPP above CPPopt for PRx (chi(2) = 7.8, p = 0.005). These relationships were not statistically significant for CPPopt for L-PRx., CONCLUSIONS: The PRx is superior to the L-PRx for TBI outcome prediction. Individual CPPopt for L-PRx and PRx are not statistically different. Deviations between CPP and CPPopt for PRx are relevant for outcome prediction; those between CPP and CPPopt for L-PRx are not. The PRx uses the entire B-wave spectrum for index calculation, whereas the L-PRX covers only one-third of it. This may explain the performance discrepancy.",2015,/,Journal of neurosurgery,122,3,588-94,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2014.10.JNS14602,25423266,#6980,Lang 2015,,yes

The Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) Study was a prospective, observational cohort study in 67 adult critical care units. Adult patients admitted to critical care following acute TBI with a last pre-sedation Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 15 were recruited. The primary outcomes were mortality and unfavorable outcome (death or severe disability, assessed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) at six months following TBI. Of 3626 critical care unit admissions, 2975 were analyzed. Following imputation of missing outcomes, mortality at six months was 25.7% and unfavorable outcome 57.4%. Ten risk prediction models were validated from Hukkelhoven and colleagues, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) Trial Collaborators, and the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) group. The model with the best discrimination was the IMPACT ""Lab"" model (C index, 0.779 for mortality and 0.713 for unfavorable outcome). This model was well calibrated for mortality at six months but substantially under-predicted the risk of unfavorable outcome. Recalibration of the models resulted in small improvements in discrimination and excellent calibration for all models. The risk prediction models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to support their use in research and audit but fell below the level required to guide individual patient decision-making.

Diagnostic approaches to predict persistent post-traumatic symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury - a literature review.,"Studerus-Germann, Aline M; Thiran, Jean-Philippe; Daducci, Alessandro; Gautschi, Oliver P","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurological disorders in emergency departments. Although there are established recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment in the acute stage, there is an on-going debate in which diagnostic methods and risk factors predict unfavourable long-term outcome after mTBI. This literature review addresses the question, which diagnostic approaches may best predict persistent post-traumatic symptoms (pPTS). A literature search for experimental studies from January 2000 to September 2014 evaluating the following diagnostic approaches (1) susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), (2) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), (3) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), (4) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as predictive factors of pPTS or unfavourable cognitive outcome in adult populations with mTBI was performed. DTI has been proved to be a valuable tool to identify diffuse axonal injury (DAI) after mTBI. Additionally, some studies showed associations between DAI and unfavourable cognitive outcome. SWI has shown to be a highly sensitive imaging method to identify microbleeds. The presence and quantity of microbleeds in this imaging technique can further provide aetiological evidence for pPTS. MRS provides information about local neurons metabolism and preliminary data show that creatine-phosphocreatine levels measured after mTBI are predictive of cognitive outcome and emotional distress. The results of one study have shown fMRI as a useful tool to differentiate mTBI patients with pPTS from controls and mTBI patients without pPTS in a resting-state condition. From the evaluated diagnostic approaches to predict pPTS after mTBI, DTI, SWI, MRS, and fMRI seem to have adequate sensitivity and specificity as predictive diagnostic tools for pPTS.

We investigated the diagnostic and prognostic values of serum BDNF in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We examined serum BDNF in two independent cohorts of TBI cases presenting to the emergency departments (EDs) of the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH; n = 76) and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH, n = 80), and a control group of JHH ED patients without TBI (n = 150). Findings were subsequently validated in the prospective, multi-center Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) Pilot study (n = 159). We investigated the association between BDNF, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and recovery from TBI at 6 months in the TRACK-TBI Pilot cohort. Incomplete recovery was defined as having either post-concussive syndrome or a Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score <8 at 6 months. Median day-of-injury BDNF concentrations (ng/mL) were lower among TBI cases (JHH TBI, 17.5 and SFGH TBI, 13.8) than in JHH controls (60.3; p = 0.0001). Among TRACK-TBI Pilot subjects, median BDNF concentrations (ng/mL) were higher in mild (8.3) than in moderate (4.3) or severe TBI (4.0; p = 0.004. In the TRACK-TBI cohort, the 75 (71.4%) subjects with very low BDNF values (i.e., <the 1st percentile for non-TBI controls, <14.2 ng/mL) had higher odds of incomplete recovery than those who did not have very low values (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-11.0). The area under the receiver operator curve for discriminating complete and incomplete recovery was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52-0.78) for BDNF, 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49-0.73) for GFAP, and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.43-0.66) for UCH-L1. The addition of GFAP/UCH-L1 to BDNF did not improve outcome prediction significantly.

Using Post-Traumatic Amnesia To Predict Outcome after Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Ponsford, Jennie L; Spitz, Gershon; McKenzie, Dean","Duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) has emerged as a strong measure of injury severity after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite the growing international adoption of this measure, there remains a lack of consistency in the way in which PTA duration is used to classify severity of injury. This study aimed to establish the classification of PTA that would best predict functional or productivity outcomes. We conducted a cohort study of 1041 persons recruited from inpatient admissions to a TBI rehabilitation center between 1985 and 2013. Participants had a primary diagnosis of TBI, emerged from PTA before discharge from inpatient hospital, and engaged in productive activities before injury. Eight models that classify duration of PTA were evaluated-six that were based on the literature and two that were statistically driven. Models were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as well as model-based Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistics. All categorization models showed longer PTA to be associated with a greater likelihood of being nonproductive at 1 year after TBI. Classification systems with a greater number of categories performed better than two-category systems. The dimensional (continuous) form of PTA resulted in the greatest AUC, and lowest AIC as well as BIC, of the classification systems examined. This finding indicates that the greatest accuracy in prognosis is likely to be achieved using PTA as a continuous variable. This enables the probability of productive outcomes to be estimated with far greater precision than that possible using a classification system. Categorizing PTA to classify severity of injury may be reducing the precision with which clinicians can plan the treatment of patients after TBI.",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,11,997-1004,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4025,26234939,#6950,Ponsford 2016,,yes
Prognostic Value of Quantitative Diffusion-Weighted MRI in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Shakir, Afaaf; Aksoy, Didem; Mlynash, Michael; Harris, Odette A; Albers, Gregory W; Hirsch, Karen G","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data about the predictive value of quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is lacking. This study aimed to determine if specific apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds could be determined that correlate with outcome in moderate-severe TBI., METHODS: This retrospective observational study investigated patients with moderate-severe TBI. MRIs obtained post-injury days 1-13 were analyzed. MRIs were obtained on a 1.5T scanner; 20-23 contiguous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sections with a spin-echo echo planar imaging DWI 256x256 reconstructed matrix; field of view 24x24 cm; slice thickness/gap of 5/1.5 or 5/2.5 mm. The ADC value of each brain tissue voxel was determined. The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated and correlated with outcome. A good outcome was defined as discharge to home or a rehabilitation facility., RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were analyzed. Thirty-five patients (46%) had a good outcome. The timing of MRI scans did not differ between groups, but the mean age did (42+/-18 years vs. 56+/-19 years, p<.01, good vs. poor outcome). Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher percentage of brain volume with ADC < 400x10(-6) mm2 /second (.85+/-.67% vs. .60+/-.29%, poor vs. good outcome, p<.05). Using a ROC curve analysis and Youden's index, an ADC <400x10(-6) mm2 /second in >=.49% of brain was 85% sensitive and 46% specific for poor outcome (p<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative MRI offers additional prognostic information in acute TBI. A whole brain tissue ADC threshold of <400x10(-6) mm2 /second in >=.49% of brain may be a novel prognostic biomarker.

Neurosurgical intervention in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and its effect on neurological outcomes.,"Tierney, Kevin James; Nayak, Natasha V; Prestigiacomo, Charles J; Sifri, Ziad C","OBJECTIVE: The object of this study was to determine the mortality and neurological outcome of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) who require neurosurgical intervention (NSI), identify clinical predictors of a poor outcome, and investigate the effect of failed nonoperative management and delayed NSI on outcome., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 10 years was performed, capturing all adults with mTBI and NSI. Primary outcome variables were mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Patients were divided into an immediate intervention group, which received an NSI after the initial cranial CT scan, and a delayed intervention group, which had failed nonoperative management and received an NSI after 2 or more cranial CT scans., RESULTS: The mortality rate in mTBI patients requiring NSI was 13%, and the mean GOS score was 3.6 +/- 1.2. An age > 60 years was independently predictive of a worse outcome, and epidural hematoma was independently predictive of a good outcome. Logistic regression analysis using independent variables was calculated to create a model for predicting poor neurological outcomes in patients with mTBI undergoing NSI and had 74.1% accuracy. Patients in the delayed intervention group had worse mortality (25% vs 9%) and worse mean GOS scores (2.9 +/- 1.3 vs 3.7 +/- 1.2) than those in the immediate intervention group., CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study demonstrate that patients with mTBI requiring NSI have higher mortality rates and worse neurological outcomes and should therefore be classified separately from mTBI patients not requiring NSI.

Time Course of Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Parameters in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Nakae, Ryuta; Takayama, Yasuhiro; Kuwamoto, Kentaro; Naoe, Yasutaka; Sato, Hidetaka; Yokota, Hiroyuki","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long been associated with coagulopathy; however, the time course of coagulation/fibrinolytic parameters in the acute phase of TBI remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to analyze the time course of coagulation/fibrinolytic parameters in the acute phase of TBI and to elucidate parameter relationships to prognosis. We retrospectively evaluated 234 patients with severe isolated TBI with initial blood samples obtained no more than 1 h after injury. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plasma levels of fibrinogen, and D-dimer were measured on arrival in the emergency department and 3, 6, and 12 h after injury.

Serial plasma oxidative level and antioxidant were examined in 88 patients with acute TBI and 27 control individuals., RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with TBI had significantly increased serum glutathione (GSH) levels on presentation and significantly decreased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase levels. Outcome was assessed on discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Serum GSH and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase levels were significantly higher in the good outcome group than in the poor outcome group on day 1 (P = 0.008 and P = 0.026, respectively). In the logistic regression analysis, only motor deficits and GSH levels on presentation were independently associated with outcome. A GSH cutoff value of 1.106 mumol/L on presentation was associated with good outcome in patients with acute TBI., CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status of serum correlate with trauma severity and may be used to predict outcomes after TBI.

IMPACT model calibration was poor for both older and younger strata (Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value for the core-death model = 0.01 vs < 0.0001, respectively). Pre-specified qualitative graphical evaluation suggested substantial under-prediction of mortality in the oldest decades of life, but not among younger patients., CONCLUSIONS: The examined IMPACT prognostic models demonstrated adequate discrimination and poor calibration in both older and younger patients, yet particular caution may be required when applying these models to the elderly.",2016,/,Brain injury,30,7,899-907,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2016.1146964,27058813,#6728,Staples 2016,,yes
Factors associated with long-term functional and psychological outcomes in persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.,"Khan, Fary; Amatya, Bhasker; Judson, Rodney; Chung, Pearl; Truesdale, Melinda; Elmalik, Alaeldin; Galea, Mary P","OBJECTIVE: To examine factors impacting long-term functional and psychological outcomes in persons with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study (n = 103) assessed the long-term (up to 5 years) impact of traumatic brain injury on participants' current activity and restriction in participation using validated questionnaires., RESULTS: Participants' median age was 49.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 20.4-23.8), the majority were male (77%), and 49% had some form of previous rehabilitation. The common causes of traumatic brain injury were falls (42%) and motor vehicle accidents (27%). Traumatic brain injury-related symptoms were: pain/headache (47%), dizziness (36%), bladder/bowel impairment (34%), and sensory-perceptual deficits (34%). Participants reported minimal change in their physical function and cognition (Functional Assessment Measure: motor (median 102, IQR 93-111) and cognition (median 89, IQR 78-95)). Participants were well-adjusted to community-living; however, they reported high levels of depression. Factors significantly associated with poorer current level of functioning/well-being included: older age (>= 60 years), presence of traumatic brain injury-related symptoms, a lack of previous rehabilitation and those classified in ""severe disability categories"" at admission.

Analysis of the association of fluid balance and short-term outcome in traumatic brain injury.,"Zhao, Zilong; Wang, Dong; Jia, Ying; Tian, Ye; Wang, Yi; Wei, Yingsheng; Zhang, Jianning; Jiang, Rongcai","INTRODUCTION: A balance of fluid intake and output (fluid balance) influences outcomes of critical illness, but the level of such influence remains poorly understood for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and was quantitatively examined in this study., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 351 moderate and severe TBI patients to associate the degree of fluid balance with clinical outcomes of TBI. Fluid balance and intracranial pressure (ICP) were continuously recorded for 7days on patients admitted to neurocritical care unit (NCCU). The short-term outcome was dichotomized into improvement and deterioration groups based on changes in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) measured between admission and 30days after admission. Fluid balance was calculated as: Fluid intake (mL) - fluid outputs (mL)/dayx5 and used to group patients in tertiles to study its effect on TBI outcome., RESULTS: Patients at the low (<637mL) and upper (>3673mL) tertiles of fluid balance were associated with poor outcomes. Those in the upper tertile also had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and refractory intracranial hypertension (RIH). There was a negative correlation between the cumulative fluid balance and the short-term outcome for patients in the low tertile and a positive correlation between the cumulative fluid balance and the short-term outcome in the upper fluid balance group. Levels of fluid balance were also associated with serum creatinine (Cr, r=0.451, P<0.0001) and days in NCCU (r=0.188, P=0.001). More patients in the upper tertile had ICP higher than 20mmHg (P=0.009). A fluid balance in the upper tertile is an independent predictor of poor 30-day clinical outcomes after the adjustment for confounding variables in a multivariable logistic regression model., CONCLUSION: We found that fluid balance in low and upper tertiles were associated with poor short-term outcomes and ICP variations. Fluid balance in the upper tertile may be an independent predictor for poor 30-day outcome, primarily due to high AKI and RIH. Copyright © 2016.

Incidence and outcome of cardiac injury in patients with severe head trauma.,"Hasanin, Ahmed; Kamal, Amr; Amin, Shereen; Zakaria, Dina; El Sayed, Riham; Mahmoud, Kareem; Mukhtar, Ahmed","BACKGROUND: Although cardiac injury has been reported in patients with various neurological conditions, few data report cardiac injury in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this work is to report the incidence of cardiac injury in patients with TBI and its impact on patient outcome., METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on a cohort of 50 patients with severe TBI. Only patients with isolated severe TBI defined as Glascow coma scale (GCS) < 8 were included in the study. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, GCS, hemodynamic data, serum Troponin I, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiographic examination, and patients' outcome were recorded. A neurogenic cardiac injury score (NCIS) was calculated for all patients (rising troponin = 1, abnormal echocardiography = 1, hypotension = 1). Univariate and multivariate analyses for risk factors for mortality were done for all risk factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fifty patients were included; age was 31 +/- 12, APACHE II was 21 +/- 5, and male patients were 45 (90 %). Troponin I was elevated in 27 (54 %) patients, abnormal echocardiography and hypotension were documented in 14 (28 %) and 16 (32 %) patients, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 36 %. Risk factors for mortality by univariate analysis were age, GCS, APACHE II score, serum troponin level, NCIS, and hypotension. However, in multivariate analysis, the only two independent risk factors for mortality were APACHE II score (OR = 1.25, 95 % confidence interval: 1.02-1.54, P = 0.03) and NCIS score (OR = 8.38, 95 % confidence interval: 1.44-48.74, P = 0.018)., CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury is common in patients with TBI and is associated with increased mortality.

"Hyposmia, not emotion perception, is associated with psychosocial outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.","Osborne-Crowley, Katherine; McDonald, Skye","OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to determine whether 2 variables associated with orbitofrontal damage, hyposmia and emotion perception deficits, are associated with socially disinhibited behavior and psychosocial outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: The Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), an emotion labeling task, an emotion intensity rating task, and an observational measure of social disinhibition were completed by 23 individuals with severe TBI. The disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by a close other. Fifteen control participants provided norms against which to assess performance on the emotion intensity rating task., RESULTS: BSIT scores predicted informant-reported change in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS-IR. Hyposmia, though, was not associated with informant-reported or observed social disinhibition. An impairment in accuracy scores on both emotion perceptions tasks was found for participants with TBI, yet intensity ratings did not differ between groups. This suggests that people with TBI are not actually impaired at detecting intensity of emotion but are less likely to perceive the target emotion as the dominant emotion. Emotion perception was not related to disinhibition or change in interpersonal relationships., CONCLUSIONS: These results support previous claims that hyposmia has prognostic significance following TBI. On the other hand, emotion perception impairment measured by standardized tasks does not appear to be an important factor in interpersonal outcomes. Finally, these results suggest that standardized emotion perception tasks may underestimate the emotion perception capabilities of people with TBI.

Pre-injury psychosocial and demographic predictors of long-term functional outcomes post-TBI.,"Seagly, Katharine S; O'Neil, Rochelle L; Hanks, Robin A","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pre-injury psychosocial and demographic factors differentially influence long-term functional outcomes post-TBI., SETTING: Urban rehabilitation hospital., PARTICIPANTS: 149 individuals, ages 16-75, who sustained a mild complicated, moderate or severe TBI, were enrolled in a TBI Model System (TBIMS), and had functional outcome data five-15 years post-injury., DESIGN: Archival data were analysed with SPSS-18 using multiple regression to determine amount of variance accounted for in five functional domains. Predictors included age at injury, pre-injury education, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pre-injury incarceration and psychiatric history., MEASURES: Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART), including Cognitive Independence, Physical Independence, Mobility, Occupation and Social Integration domains., RESULTS: Models were significant for Cognitive and Physical Independence, Mobility, and Occupation. Incarceration and psychiatric history accounted for the most variance in Cognitive and Physical Independence, over and above GCS and age at injury. Psychiatric history was also the strongest predictor of Occupation. Mobility was the only domain in which GCS accounted for the most variance., CONCLUSION: Pre-injury psychosocial and demographic factors may be more important than injury severity for predicting some long-term functional outcomes post-TBI.

Quantitative EEG Parameters for Prediction of Outcome in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Development Study.,"Tolonen, Antti; Sarkela, Mika O K; Takala, Riikka S K; Katila, Ari; Frantzen, Janek; Posti, Jussi P; Muller, Markus; van Gils, Mark; Tenovuo, Olli","Monitoring of quantitative EEG (QEEG) parameters in the intensive care unit (ICU) can aid in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients by complementing visual EEG review done by an expert. We performed an explorative study investigating the prognostic value of 59 QEEG parameters in predicting the outcome of patients with severe TBI. Continuous EEG recordings were done on 28 patients with severe TBI in the ICU of Turku University Hospital. We computed a set of QEEG parameters for each patient, and correlated these to patient outcome, measured by dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at a follow-up visit between 6 and 12 months, using area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a nonlinear correlation measure. For 17 of the 59 QEEG parameters (28.8%), the AUC differed significantly from 0.5, most of these parameters measured EEG power or variability. The best QEEG parameters for outcome prediction were alpha power (AUC = 0.87, P < .01) and variability of the relative fast theta power (AUC = 0.84, P < .01). The results of this study indicate that QEEG parameters provide useful information for predicting outcome in severe TBI. Novel QEEG parameters with potential in outcome prediction were found, the prognostic value of these parameters should be confirmed in later studies.

The factors influencing outcomes in LMIC have not been examined as rigorously as in higher-income countries., METHODS: This study was conducted to examine clinical and demographic factors influencing TBI outcomes in Latin American LMIC. Data were prospectively collected during a randomized trial of intracranial pressure monitoring in severe TBI and a companion observational study. Participants were aged >=13 years and admitted to study hospitals with Glasgow Coma Scale score <=8. The primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Scale, Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months. Predictors were analyzed using a multivariable proportional odds model created by forward stepwise selection., RESULTS: A total of 550 patients were identified. Six-month outcomes were available for 88%, of whom 37% had died and 44% had achieved a GOS-E score of 5-8. In multivariable proportional odds modeling, higher Glasgow Coma Scale motor score (odds ratio [OR], 1.41 per point; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.61) and epidural hematoma (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86) were significant predictors of higher GOS-E score, whereas advanced age (OR, 0.65 per 10 years; 95% CI, 0.57-0.73) and cisternal effacement (P < 0.001) were associated with lower GOS-E score. Study site (P < 0.001) and race (P = 0.004) significantly predicted outcome, outweighing clinical variables such as hypotension and pupillary examination., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from severe TBI is high in Latin American LMIC, although the rate of favorable recovery is similar to that of high-income countries.

Outcome of Traumatic Brain Injury in the Elderly Population: A Tertiary Center Experience in a Developing Country.,"Prasad, G Lakshmi; Anmol, N; Menon, Girish R","BACKGROUND: The growing elderly population has contributed to an increasing incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in this cohort worldwide. Here we describe our institutional experience in the management of TBI in elderly Indian patients., METHODS: This was a 3-year retrospective analysis of 73 consecutive patients age >=65 years admitted to our university hospital with TBI. Exclusion criteria included a history of concussion injury, chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), discharge against medical advice, and declared dead within 6 hours after arrival. Mode of injury, clinicoradiologic features, management, and outcomes were analyzed. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to assess outcome., RESULTS: Our cohort was predominately male (82%). The mean patient age was 72.1 years (range, 65-97 years), and 20 were age >=75 years. Head injuries (HIs) were mild in 37 patients, moderate in 18, and severe in 18. The majority of injuries were contusions. Fifty-five patients (75%) were managed conservatively, and 18 (25%) underwent surgery. There were 7 deaths (9.5%). The rate of poor outcome was 26% overall, and 45% in patients age >=75 years. Poor outcome in severe HI was seen in 83% (15 of 18) of the entire cohort but in 100% (7 of 7) of the very elderly patients. On univariate analysis, age >=75 years, severe HI, acute SDH, and surgical management were significantly associated with poor outcome while acute SDH and surgical management were significant on multilogistic regression analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Age >=75 years, severe HI, and acute SDH are poor prognostic factors in patients with TBI. The benefit of surgery in these patients is unlikely, and surgery needs to weighed judiciously, keeping in mind the economics involved and the fate of caregivers, especially in developing countries.

We analyzed data of 214 consecutive patients aged >=65 years, including demographics, medical history, cause and time of injury, neurologic state, radiologic reports, and laboratory results. A predictive model was developed using logistic regression modeling with a backward stepwise feature selection., RESULTS: The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission was 14 (interquartile range, 12-15), whereas the 30-day mortality or vegetative state rate amounted to 23.4%. Starting with 20 predefined features, the final prediction model highlighted the importance of GCS motor score (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.32); presence of comorbid cardiac, pulmonary, or renal dysfunction or malignancy (OR, 2.86; 9 5% CI, 1.08-7.61); platelets <=100 x 109 cells/L (OR, 13.60; 95% CI, 3.33-55.49); and red blood cell distribution width coefficient of variation >=14.5% (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.09-7.78). The discovered coefficients were used for nomogram development. It was further simplified to facilitate clinical use. The proposed scoring system, Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score (eTBI Score), yielded similar performance metrics., CONCLUSIONS: The eTBI Score is the first scoring system designed specifically for older adults. It could constitute a framework for clinical decision-making and serve as an outcome predictor. Its capability to stratify risk provides reliable criteria for assessing efficacy of TBI management.

Higher plasma C-type lectin-like receptor 2 concentrations for prediction of higher risk of 30-day mortality in isolated severe blunt traumatic brain injury.,"Guo, Mi; Zhang, Han; Lv, Qing-Wei; Huang, Hang-Bin; Shen, Liang-Jun","BACKGROUND: Platelet activation is implicated in secondary brain injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI). C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) is extensively expressed on platelets and participates in platelet activation. We investigate dthe prognostic significance of plasma CLEC-2 in TBI patients., METHODS: One hundred and six patients with isolated severe blunt TBI and 106 healthy controls were prospectively investigated. Plasma CLEC-2 concentrations were detected and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores were recorded. The relationship between plasma CLEC-2 concentrations and 30-day mortality in addition to overall survival was determined using multivariate models., RESULTS: Patients exhibited a substantially higher concentration of plasma CLEC-2 than healthy controls. Among patients, plasma CLEC-2 concentrations were remarkably increased in the GCS scores- and Rotterdam computerized tomography classification- dependent manner. As compared with survivors within posttraumatic 30days, plasma CLEC-2 concentrations were remarkably raised in non-survivors. Rising plasma CLEC-2 concentration was independently associated with an enhanced risk of 30-day mortality and short overall survival time. Plasma CLEC-2 concentrations had a significantly high area under receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting 30-day mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Incremental plasma CLEC-2 concentrations are intimately related to increasing trauma severity, in close association with increased 30-day death, indicating the prognostic role of plasma CLEC-2 in TBI.

Discovery and validation of temporal patterns involved in human brain ketometabolism in cerebral microdialysis fluids of traumatic brain injury patients.,"Eiden, Michael; Christinat, Nicolas; Chakrabarti, Anirikh; Sonnay, Sarah; Miroz, John-Paul; Cuenoud, Bernard; Oddo, Mauro; Masoodi, Mojgan","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as a metabolic disease, characterized by acute cerebral glucose hypo-metabolism. Adaptive metabolic responses to TBI involve the utilization of alternative energy substrates, such as ketone bodies. Cerebral microdialysis (CMD) has evolved as an accurate technique allowing continuous sampling of brain extracellular fluid and assessment of regional cerebral metabolism. We present the successful application of a combined hypothesis- and data-driven metabolomics approach using repeated CMD sampling obtained routinely at patient bedside. Investigating two patient cohorts (n=26 and n=12), we identified clinically relevant metabolic patterns at the acute post-TBI critical care phase., METHODS: Clinical and CMD metabolomics data were integrated and analysed using in silico and data modelling approaches. We used both unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis techniques to investigate structures within the time series and associations with patient outcome., FINDINGS: The multivariate metabolite time series exhibited two characteristic brain metabolic states that were attributed to changes in key metabolites: valine, 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid (4-MOV), isobeta-hydroxybutyrate (iso-bHB), tyrosyine, and 2-ketoisovaleric acid (2-KIV). These identified cerebral metabolic states differed significantly with respect to standard clinical values. We validated our findings in a second cohort using a classification model trained on the cerebral metabolic states. We demonstrated that short-term (therapeutic intensity level (TIL)) and mid-term patient outcome (6-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS)) can be predicted from the time series characteristics., INTERPRETATION: We identified two specific cerebral metabolic patterns that are closely linked to ketometabolism and were associated with both TIL and GOS. Our findings support the view that advanced metabolomics approaches combined with CMD may be applied in real-time to predict short-term treatment intensity and long-term patient outcome.

Data were collected at brain injury clinics at 8-10 weeks and one-year after injury. Functional recovery at one year was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Results: A follow-up rate of 92% was achieved. The most common aetiologies of mTBI were falls (n = 222) and road traffic collisions (n = 154). Distribution of GCS was 15 (n = 363), 14 (n = 156) and 13 (n = 77).

Elderly patients had a poor prognosis when they had dementia (odds ratio [OR]: 20.357, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.075-199.683, p=0.010), cancer (OR: 14.005, 95% CI: 1.262-154.444, p=0.032), or a history of antithrombotic therapy before admission (OR: 6.673, 95% CI: 1.072-41.526, p=0.042). When elderly patients aged 75years or older with mild TBI have the 3 poor prognostic factors of dementia, cancer, or a history of antithrombotic therapy, their outcomes might be worse compared to other elderly patients. Elderly patients who have these factors should be carefully managed. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute elevation of serum inflammatory markers predicts symptom recovery after concussion.,"Nitta, Morgan E; Savitz, Jonathan; Nelson, Lindsay D; Teague, T Kent; Hoelzle, James B; McCrea, Michael A; Meier, Timothy B","OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that acute elevations in serum inflammatory markers predict symptom recovery after sport-related concussion (SRC)., METHODS: High school and collegiate football players (n = 857) were prospectively enrolled. Forty-one athletes with concussion and 43 matched control athletes met inclusion criteria. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, interferon-gamma, and IL-1 receptor antagonist and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) symptom severity scores were collected at a preinjury baseline, 6 and 24-48 hours postinjury, and approximately 8, 15, and 45 days following concussion. The number of days that athletes were symptomatic following SRC (i.e., duration of symptoms) was the primary outcome variable., RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-1RA were significantly elevated in athletes with concussion at 6 hours relative to preinjury and other postinjury visits, as well as compared to controls (ps <= 0.001). IL-6 and IL-1RA significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes at 6 hours postconcussion (IL-6 area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.92], IL-1RA AUC 0.79 [95% CI 0.67-0.90]). Further, IL-6 levels at 6 hours postconcussion were significantly associated with the duration of symptoms (hazard ratio for symptom recovery = 0.61 [95% CI 0.38-0.96], p = 0.031)., CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential utility of IL-6 and IL-1RA as serum biomarkers of SRC and demonstrate the potential of these markers in identifying athletes at risk for prolonged recovery after SRC., CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1RA 6 hours postconcussion significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes.

Usefulness of serum interleukin-33 as a prognostic marker of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Zhang, Zu-Yong; Li, Jun; Ye, Qi; Dong, Yong; Bao, Guang-Ming; Shen, You-Kui; Weng, Jian-Feng; Luo, Li-Feng; Cen, Meng","BACKGROUND: Interleukin-33 is recently identified as a brain injury biomarker. We determined whether serum interlerukin-33 concentrations are associated with inflammation, severity and prognosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: We detected serum interlerukin-33 concentrations of 102 healthy controls and 102 severe TBI patients, as well as serum concentrations of 3 inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein) and 7 cell-specific proteins (myelin basic protein, glial fibrillary astrocyte protein, S100B, neuron-specific enolase, phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H, Tau and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1) in 102 severe TBI patients. The recorded poor prognosis variables included acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury, posttraumatic cerebral infarction and six-month mortality and poor outcome (Glasgow score of 1-3)., RESULTS: Median interlerukin-33 concentration of patients (692pg/mL) was substantially raised, as compared to controls. Interlerukin-33 concentrations were significantly correlated with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score and the preceding biomarkers concentrations. Interlerukin-33 concentration>692pg/mL emerged as an independent prognostic predictor and its discriminatory capability exceeded those of the above-mentioned inflammatory biomarkers concentrations and was in the range of GCS scores and the aforementioned cell-specific proteins concentrations., CONCLUSION: Ascending serum interlerukin-33 concentrations could reflect inflammation, severity and worse prognosis following TBI.

Apoptosis in cerebrospinal fluid as outcome predictors in severe traumatic brain injury: An observational study.,"Jiang, Wenqing; Jin, Peng; Wei, Wenfeng; Jiang, Wei","Traumatic brain injury (TBI), due to its high mortality and morbidity, is an important research topic. Apoptosis plays a pathogenic role in a series of neurological disorders, from neurodegenerative diseases to acute neurological lesions. In this study, we analyzed the association between apoptosis and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), to examine the potential of apoptosis as a biomarker for a TBI outcome. Patients with severe TBI were recruited at the Department of Neurosurgery, Wujin Hospital Affiliated with Jiangsu University, between January 2018 and December 2019. As a control group, healthy subjects were recruited. The concentrations of caspase-3, cytochrome c, sFas, and caspase-9 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The association between the GOS and the clinical variables age, sex, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), initial computed tomography (CT) findings, and apoptotic factors was determined using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and thus the sensitivity and specificity of each risk factor, were obtained. The levels of caspase-3, cytochrome c, sFas, and caspase-9 in the TBI group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < .05). The logistic regression results showed that ICP and caspase-3 were significant predictors of outcome at 6 months post-TBI (P < .05). The AUC was 0.925 and 0.888 for ICP and caspase-3, respectively. However, the AUC for their combined prediction was 0.978, with a specificity and sensitivity of 96.0% and 95.2%, respectively, showing that the combined prediction was more reliable than that of the 2 separate factors. We demonstrated that caspase-3, cytochrome C, sFas, and caspase-9 were significantly increased in the CSF of patients following severe TBI. Furthermore, we found that ICP and caspase-3 were more reliable for outcome prediction in combination, rather than separately.",2020,/,Medicine,99,26,e20922,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000020922,32590803,#4653,Jiang 2020,,yes
Long-term follow-up of neurosurgical outcomes for adult patients in Uganda with traumatic brain injury.,"Jin, Michael C; Kakusa, Bina; Ku, Seul; Vaca, Silvia D; Xu, Linda W; Nalwanga, Juliet; Kiryabwire, Joel; Ssenyonjo, Hussein; Mukasa, John; Muhumuza, Michael; Fuller, Anthony T; Haglund, Michael M; Grant, Gerald A","OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Uganda and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Due to the difficulty of long-term in-person follow-up, there is a paucity of literature on longitudinal outcomes of TBI in LMICs. Using a scalable phone-centered survey, this study attempted to investigate factors associated with both mortality and quality of life in Ugandan patients with TBI., METHODS: A prospective registry of adult patients with TBI admitted to the neurosurgical ward at Mulago National Referral Hospital was assembled. Long-term follow-up was conducted between 10.4 and 30.5 months after discharge (median 18.6 months). Statistical analyses included univariable and multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression to elucidate factors associated with mortality and long-term recovery., RESULTS: A total of 1274 adult patients with TBI were included, of whom 302 (23.7%) died as inpatients. Patients who died as inpatients received surgery less frequently (p < 0.001), had more severe TBI at presentation (p < 0.001), were older (p < 0.001), and were more likely to be female (p < 0.0001). Patients presenting with TBI resulting from assault were at reduced risk of inpatient death compared with those presenting with TBI caused by road traffic accidents (OR 0.362, 95% CI 0.128-0.933). Inpatient mortality and postdischarge mortality prior to follow-up were 23.7% and 9%, respectively. Of those discharged, 60.8% were reached through phone interviews. Higher Glasgow Coma Scale score at discharge (continuous HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.94) was associated with improved long-term survival. Tracheostomy (HR 4.38, 95% CI 1.05-16.7) and older age (continuous HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.009-1.05) were associated with poor long-term outcomes. More than 15% of patients continued to suffer from TBI sequelae years after the initial injury, including seizures (6.1%) and depression (10.0%). Despite more than 60% of patients seeking follow-up healthcare visits, mortality was still 9% among discharged patients, suggesting a need for improved longitudinal care to monitor recovery progress., CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient and postdischarge mortality remain high following admission to Uganda's main tertiary hospital with the diagnosis of TBI. Furthermore, posttraumatic sequelae, including seizures and depression, continue to burden patients years after discharge.

Although changes in brain glucose metabolism and extracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio are well known, it was hitherto unknown whether these translate to downstream changes in ATP metabolism and intracellular pH. We have performed the first clinical voxel-based in vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) in 13 acute-phase major TBI patients versus 10 healthy controls (HCs), at 3T, focusing on eight central 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm3 voxels per subject. PCr/gammaATP ratio (a measure of energy status) in TBI patients was significantly higher (median = 1.09) than that of HCs (median = 0.93) (p < 0.0001), due to changes in both PCr and ATP. There was no significant difference in PCr/gammaATP between TBI patients with favourable and unfavourable outcome. Cerebral intracellular pH of TBI patients was significantly higher (median = 7.04) than that of HCs (median = 7.00) (p = 0.04).

Serum bilirubin level correlates with mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Wang, Ruoran; He, Min; Xu, Jianguo","As a catabolic product of hemoglobin, bilirubin has been confirmed playing an important role in the development of various central nervous system disease. The aim of this study is to explore the correlation between serum bilirubin level and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients admitted with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2018 were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory data of 361 patients were retrospectively collected to explore the independent risk factors of mortality. The comparison of baseline characteristics showed that non-survivors had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (P < .001) and higher level of serum total bilirubin (TBIL) (P < .001) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) (P < .001). We found that only GCS (P < .001), glucose (P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = .042) and DBIL (P = .005) were significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis. GCS and DBIL had comparable AUC value (0.778 vs 0.750, P > .05) on predicting mortality in TBI patients. The AUC value of the combination of GCS and DBIL is higher than the single value of these two factors (P < .05). Moreover, predictive model 1 consisted of GCS, glucose, LDH and DBIL had the highest AUC value of 0.894.DBIL is a significant risk factor of mortality in TBI patients.

CRP Albumin ratio is positively associated with poor outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Wang, Ruoran; He, Min; Ou, Xiaofeng; Xie, Xiaoqi; Kang, Yan","OBJECTIVES: The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), a novel inflammation-based index, has been proved useful in predicting outcome of various diseases. We designed this study to explore the prognostic value of CAR in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 151 patients diagnosed with TBI and collected related clinical and laboratory data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to find independent risk factors of mortality. Then, we incorporated CAR into prognostic model and drew receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of models. Finally, we compared the predictive value of different models by evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC)., RESULTS: In this study, a total of 54 patients had poor survival outcome with mortality rate of 35.8 %. Results of multivariate analysis showed that GCS score in admission (OR 0.700, 95 %Cl 0.570-0.860, p=0.001), acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 3.952, 95Cl 1.631-9.577, p=0.002) and CAR (OR 1.202, 95Cl 1.039-1.390, p=0.013) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. The AUC value of predictive model composed of the above three factors was higher than GCS or CAR alone., CONCLUSION: CAR is an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with TBI.

Concussion Symptom Cutoffs for Identification and Prognosis of Sports-Related Concussion: Role of Time Since Injury.,"Eagle, Shawn R; Womble, Melissa N; Elbin, R J; Pan, Raymond; Collins, Michael W; Kontos, Anthony P","BACKGROUND: Symptom reporting with scales such as the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) is one of the most sensitive markers of concussed status and/or recovery time, It is known that time from injury until initial clinic visit affects symptom presentation and recovery outcomes, but no study to date has evaluated changes in clinical cutoff scores for the PCSS based on earlier versus later clinical presentation postconcussion., PURPOSE: To evaluate if time since injury after sports-related concussion (SRC) affects clinical cutoff scores for total PCSS and PCSS factors in differentiating athletes with SRC from healthy controls and predicting prolonged recovery (>30 days) after SRC., STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3., METHODS: A chart review was conducted of clinical data from patients with SRC (age, 13-25 years; n = 588; female, n = 299) who presented to concussion specialty clinics. Participants were categorized on the basis of time from injury: early (<=7 days; n = 348) and late (8-21 days; n = 240). Outcomes were total symptom severity (ie, total PCSS score) and total score for each of 4 symptom factors (cognitive/migraine/fatigue [CMF], affective, sleep, and somatic). Area under the curve (AUC) analyses were conducted using the Youden index to optimize sensitivity and specificity cutoffs., RESULTS: In the early group, the CMF factor (cutoff, >=7; AUC = 0.944), affective factor (cutoff, >=1; AUC = 0.614), and total PCSS (cutoff, >=7; AUC = 0.889) differentiated athletes with SRC from controls. In the late group, the CMF factor cutoff was reduced (cutoff, >=4; AUC = 0.945), while the total PCSS score (cutoff, >=7; AUC = 0.892), affective factor (cutoff, >=1; AUC = 0.603), and sleep factor (cutoff, >=1; AUC = 0.609) remained the same. In the early cohort, the CMF factor was the strongest predictor of protracted recovery (cutoff, >=23; AUC = 0.717), followed by the total PCSS (cutoff, >=39; AUC = 0.695) and affective factor (cutoff, >=2; AUC = 0.614). The affective factor (cutoff, >=1; AUC = 0.642) and total PCSS (cutoff, >=35; AUC = 0.592) were significant predictors in the late cohort, but the cutoff threshold was reduced., CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that PCSS symptom clinical cutoffs for identifying injury and recovery prognosis change on the basis of time since injury. Specifically, the combination of CMF, affective, and sleep factors is the best differentiator of athletes with SRC from controls regardless of time since injury.

However, evidence is scarce and mostly originates from high-income countries. We aimed to describe the existing care for patients with TBI and the outcomes in China., METHODS: The Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) China registry is a prospective, multicentre, longitudinal, observational study done in 56 neurosurgical centres across China. We collected data of patients who were admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of TBI and an indication for CT. Patients who were discharged directly from the emergency room were excluded. The primary endpoint was survival on discharge. Prognostic analyses were applied to identify predictors of mortality. Variations in mortality were compared between centres and provinces within China. Mortality was compared with expected mortality, estimated using the CRASH basic model. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02210221., FINDINGS: From Dec 22, 2014, to Aug 1, 2017, 13 627 patients with TBI from 56 centres were enrolled in the registry. Data from 13 138 patients from 52 hospitals in 22 provinces of China were analysed. Most patients were male (9782 [74%]), with a median age of 48 years (IQR 33-61). The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 13 (IQR 9-15), and the leading cause of injury was road-traffic incident (6548 [50%]). Overall, 637 (5%) patients died, including 552 (20%) patients with severe TBI. Age, GCS score, injury severity score, pupillary light reflex, CT findings (compressed basal cistern and midline shift >=5 mm), presence of hypoxia, systemic hypotension, altitude higher than >500 m, and GDP per capita were significantly associated with survival in all patients with TBI. Variation in mortality existed between centres and regions. The expected 14-day mortality was 1116 (13%), but 544 (7%) deaths within 14 days were observed (observed to expected ratio 0.49 [95% CI 0.45-0.53])., INTERPRETATION: The results show differences in mortality between centres and regions across China, which indicates potential for identifying best practices through comparative effectiveness research.

Establishment and validation of a model for brain injury state evaluation and prognosis prediction.,"Li, Xia; Lu, Chao; Wang, Jun; Wan, Yi; Dai, Shu-Hui; Zhang, Lei; Hu, Xue-An; Jiang, Xiao-Fan; Fei, Zhou","PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability and death in modern times, whose evaluation and prognosis prediction have been one of the most critical issues in TBI management. However, the existed models for the abovementioned purposes were defective to varying degrees. This study aims to establish an ideal brain injury state clinical prediction model (BISCPM)., METHODS: This study was a retrospective design. The six-month outcomes of patients were selected as the end point event. BISCPM was established by using the split-sample technology, and externally validated via different tests of comparison between the observed and predicted six-month mortality in validating group. TBI patients admitted from July 2006 to June 2012 were recruited and randomly divided into establishing model group and validating model group. Twenty-one scoring indicators were included in BISCPM and divided into three parts, A, B, and C. Part A included movement, pupillary reflex and diameter, CT parameters, and secondary brain insult factors, etc. Part B was age and part C was medical history of the patients. The total score of part A, B and C was final score of BISCPM., RESULTS: Altogether 1156 TBI patients were included with 578 cases in each group. The score of BISCPM from validating group ranged from 2.75 to 31.94, averaging 13.64 +/- 5.59. There was not statistical difference between observed and predicted mortality for validating group. The discrimination validation showed that the BISCPM is superior to international mission for prognosis and analysis of clinical trials (IMPACT) lab model., CONCLUSION: BISCPM is an effective model for state evaluation and prognosis prediction of TBI patients. The use of BISCPM could be of great significance for decision-making in management of TBI. Copyright © 2020.

The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of TBI-associated hypofibrinogenemia in patients with TBI and to evaluate the prognostic value of fibrinogen level with respect to mortality and clinical outcomes., METHODS: A total of 2570 consecutive TBI patients were retrospectively studied. Prognostic evaluations were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) assessment 3 months after injury. The shape of the relationship between fibrinogen level and mortality or outcome was examined using cubic spline functions. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the association between fibrinogen level and 3-month functional outcomes., RESULTS: Fibrinogen concentrations < 2 g/L were observed in 992 (38.6%) patients at the time of admission.

Prognostic utility of early plasma matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9 concentrations after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Lima, Rosane de; Simon, Daniel; Silva, Willy Deivson Leandro da; Nabinger, Debora Dreher; Regner, Andrea","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 plasma levels were associated with intensive care unit mortality in patients who suffered severe traumatic brain injury, despite the presence of extracerebral injuries., METHODS: This prospective cohort enrolled 39 male patients who suffered severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow coma scale: 3 - 8 at hospital admission). The plasma matrix metalloproteinase -2 and matix metalloproteinase -9 levels were determined by ELISA at the time of intensive care unit admission., RESULTS: Severe traumatic brain injury was associated with a 46% intensive care unit mortality rate. Higher plasma matrix metalloproteinase -9 concentrations were associated with mortality: 147.94 +/- 18.00ng/mL for survivors and 224.23 +/- 23.86ng/mL for nonsurvivors (mean +/- standard error of the mean, p = 0.022). In contrast, there was no significant association between matrix metalloproteinase -2 levels and intensive care unit mortality: 315.68 +/- 22.90ng/mL for survivors and 336.55 +/- 24.29ng/mL for nonsurvivors (p = 0.499). Additionally, there were no significant associations between matrix metalloproteinase -2 (p = 0.711) and matrix metalloproteinase -9 (p = 0.092) levels and the presence of associated lesions., CONCLUSION: Increased plasma matrix metalloproteinase -9 levels were associated with intensive care unit mortality following severe traumatic brain injury, regardless of the presence of extracerebral injuries.

The Effect of Cerebrolysin on the Predictive Value of Baseline Prognostic Risk Score in Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Birle, Codruta; Slavoaca, Dana; Muresanu, Ioana; Chira, Diana; Vacaras, Vitalie; Stan, Adina Dora; Dina, Constantin; Strilciuc, Stefan","Cognitive dysfunction is a significant complaint among patients after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), with devastating consequences on functional recovery and quality of life. Prognostic models allow a better assessment and management of neurotrauma patients. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the predictive value of the Baseline Prognostic Risk Score (BPRS) in moderate to severe TBI, in a sample of patients treated with neurotrophic factors. Eighty patients with moderate-severe TBI from the CAPTAIN II study were included in secondary data analysis. Patients received active treatment with Cerebrolysin, 50 mL per day for ten days, followed by two treatment cycles with 10 mL per day for ten days. BPRS was determined on admission; the age was recorded, and patients were evaluated using the following neurocognitive tests: Mini-Mental State Essay (MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-III PSI) and Stroop Colour Word Test-Victoria Version at 10, 30 and 90 days. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to investigate the unique predictive value of BPRS on cognitive evolution, independent of age. BPRS independently predicted scores on the WAIS-III PSI DSCales and the Word subscale of the Stroop Colour Word Test at 90 days. Age was a significant predictor for all the investigated scales at 10, 30, and 90 days.

Increased expression of MMPs have been described in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may contribute to additional tissue injury and blood-brain barrier damage. The objectives of this study were to determine longitudinal changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of MMPs after acute TBI and in relation to clinical outcomes, with patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) serving as a contrast group. The study included 33 TBI patients with ventricular CSF serially sampled, and 38 iNPH patients in the contrast group. Magnetic bead-based immunoassays were utilized to measure the concentrations of eight MMPs in ventricular human CSF. CSF concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-10 were increased in TBI patients (at baseline) compared with the iNPH group (p < 0.001), while MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-12 did not differ between the groups. MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-10 concentrations decreased with time after trauma (p = 0.001-0.04). Increased concentrations of MMP-2 and MMP-10 in CSF at baseline were associated with an unfavourable TBI outcome (p = 0.002-0.02).

Coagulopathy has been implicated on trauma and critical care outcomes, but few studies have evaluated its role on traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. Our objective was to verify the incremental prognostic value of routine coagulopathy parameters in addition to the CRASH-CT score to predict 14-day mortality in TBI patients., METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of consecutive TBI patients admitted to a tertiary university hospital Trauma intensive care unit (ICU) from March/2012 to January/2015. The prognostic performance of the coagulation parameters platelet count, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio, INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio was assessed through logistic regression adjusted for the original CRASH-CT score. A new model, CRASH-CT-Coag, was created and its calibration (Brier scores and Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test), discrimination [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI)] and clinical utility (net reclassification index) were compared to the original CRASH-CT score., RESULTS: A total 517 patients were included (median age 39 years, 85.1% male, median admission glasgow coma scale 8, neurosurgery on 44.9%). The 14-day mortality observed and predicted by the original CRASH-CT was 22.8% and 26.2%, respectively. Platelet count < 100,000/mm3, INR > 1.2 and aPTT ratio > 1.2 were present on 11.3%, 65.0% and 27.2%, respectively, (at least one of these was altered on 70.6%). All three variables maintained statistical significance after adjustment for the CRASH-CT score. The CRASH-CT-Coag score outperformed the original score on calibration (brier scores 0.122 +/- 0.216 vs 0.132 +/- 0.202, mean difference 0.010, 95% CI 0.005-0.019, p = 0.036, respectively) and discrimination (AUC-ROC 0.854 +/- 0.020 vs 0.813 +/- 0.024, p = 0.014; IDI 5.0%, 95% CI 1.3-11.0%). Both scores showed the satisfactory H-L test results. The net reclassification index favored the new model. Considering the strata of low (< 10%), moderate (10-30%) and high (> 30%) risk of death, the CRASH-CT-Coag model yielded a global net correct reclassification of 22.9% (95% CI 3.8-43.4%)., CONCLUSIONS: The addition of early markers of coagulopathy-platelet count, INR and aPTT ratio-to the CRASH-CT score increased its accuracy.

Secreted Peptides for Diagnostic Trajectory Assessments in Brain Injury Rehabilitation.,"Patel, Parantap D; Stafflinger, Jillian E; Marwitz, Jennifer H; Niemeier, Janet P; Ottens, Andrew K","BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly improves outcomes; yet TBI heterogeneity raises the need for molecular evidence of brain recovery processes to better track patient progress, evaluate therapeutic efficacy, and provide prognostication., OBJECTIVE: Here, we assessed whether the trajectory of TBI-responsive peptides secreted into urine can produce a predictive model of functional recovery during TBI rehabilitation., METHODS: The multivariate urinary peptidome of 12 individuals with TBI was examined using quantitative peptidomics. Measures were assessed upon admission and discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. A combination of Pavlidis template matching and partial least-squares discriminant analysis was used to build models on Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, with participants bifurcated into more or less functional improvement groups., RESULTS: The produced models exhibited high sensitivity and specificity with the area under the receiver operator curve being 0.99 for DRS- and 0.95 for FIM-based models using the top 20 discriminant peptides. Predictive ability for each model was assessed using robust leave-one-out cross-validation with Q2 statistics of 0.64 (P = .00012) and 0.62 (P = .011) for DRS- and FIM-based models, respectively, both with a high predictive accuracy of 0.875. Identified peptides that discriminated improved functional recovery reflected heightened neuroplasticity and synaptic refinement and diminished cell death and neuroinflammation, consistent with postacute TBI pathobiology., CONCLUSIONS: Produced models of urine-based peptide measures reflective of ongoing recovery pathobiology can inform on rehabilitation progress after TBI, warranting further study to assess refined stratification across a larger population and efficacy in assessing therapeutic interventions.",2021,/,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,35,2,169-184,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1545968320975428,33331223,#4437,Patel 2021,,yes
Covert Speech Comprehension Predicts Recovery From Acute Unresponsive States.,"Sokoliuk, Rodika; Degano, Giulio; Banellis, Leah; Melloni, Lucia; Hayton, Tom; Sturman, Steve; Veenith, Tonny; Yakoub, Kamal M; Belli, Antonio; Noppeney, Uta; Cruse, Damian","OBJECTIVE: Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation-washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty., METHODS: We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2 to 7 days sedation-free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronizes with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients., RESULTS: Seventeen and 16 patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients' acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r > 0.6, p < 0.007), quantified by inter-trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta = 0.603, p = 0.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], computed tomography [CT] grade)., INTERPRETATION: A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.

Radiographic predictors of clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury after decompressive craniectomy.,"Hong, Jung Ho; Jeon, Ikchan; Seo, Youngbeom; Kim, Seong Ho; Yu, Dongwoo","BACKGROUND: Primary decompressive craniectomy (DC) is considered for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with clinical deterioration, presenting large amounts of high-density lesions on computed tomography (CT). Postoperative CT findings may be suitable for prognostic evaluation. This study evaluated the radiographic predictors of clinical outcome and survival using pre- and postoperative CT scans of such patients., METHODS: We enrolled 150 patients with moderate to severe TBI who underwent primary DC. They were divided into two groups based on the 6-month postoperative Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended scores (1-4, unfavorable; 5-8, favorable). Radiographic parameters, including hemorrhage type, location, presence of skull fracture, midline shifting, hemispheric diameter, effacement of cisterns, parenchymal hypodensity, and craniectomy size, were reviewed.

Cognitive deficits and rehabilitation mechanisms in mild traumatic brain injury patients revealed by EEG connectivity markers.,"Liu, Sinan; Shi, Chaoqun; Ma, Xuying; Zhao, Bingyang; Chen, Xiping; Tao, Luyang","OBJECTIVE: To explore the multiple specific biomarkers and cognitive compensatory mechanisms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients at recovery stage., METHODS: The experiment was performed in two sections. In Section I, using event-related potential, event-related oscillation and spatial phase-synchronization, we explored neural dynamics in 24 volunteered healthy controls (HC) and 38 patients at least 6 months post-mTBI (19 with epidural hematoma, EDH; 19 with subdural hematoma, SDH) during a Go/NoGo task. In Section II, according to the neuropsychological scales, patients were divided into sub-groups to assess these electroencephalography (EEG) indicators in identifying different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI., RESULTS: In Section I, mean amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d were decreased in mTBI patients relative to HC, and NoGo-theta power in the non-injured hemisphere was decreased in SDH patients only. In Section II, patients with chronic neuropsychological defects exhibited more serious impairments of intra-hemispheric connectivity, whereas inter-hemispheric centro-parietal and frontal connectivity were enhanced in response to lesions., CONCLUSIONS: EEG distinguished mTBI patients from healthy controls, and estimated different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI. The centro-parietal and frontal connectivity are the main compensatory mechanism for the recovery of mTBI patients., SIGNIFICANCE: EEG measurements and network connectivity can track recovery process and mechanism of mTBI.

Methods: A total of 104 patients with sTBI treated in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2017 to June 2019 were enrolled and divided into two groups according to their 90-day prognosis evaluated by Glasgow prognosis score (GOS): 61 cases in good prognosis group, including 42 males and 19 females, the average age was (52.6+/-4.1) years; 43 cases in poor prognosis group, including 32 males and 11 females, the average age was (53.2+/-4.4) years. The clinical data, rSIG and serum TSPO levels were compared between the two groups. The prognostic factors were analyzed by the univariate analysis and logistic regression model, and the predictive value of rSIG combined with serum TSPO was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Results: The time from injury to recovery, dilated pupils on admission, blood glucose level, serum TSPO level, CT midline shift >=5 mm, cerebral herniation and postoperative complications were independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of sTBI patients, while the rSIG was protective factor associated with the prognosis of sTBI patients (all P<0.05). The average value of rSIG in the good prognosis group was significantly higher than that in the poor prognosis group (11.6+/-3.2 vs 6.6+/-2.0, t=9.021, P<0.05). The average serum level of TSPO in the good prognosis group was lower than that in the poor prognosis group ((1.3+/-0.3) vs (3.1+/-1.1) mug/L, t=12.350, P<0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of the combination of rSIG value and TSPO level for predicting the poor prognosis of sTBI patients was 0.920 (95%CI: 0.808-0.978), which was significantly higher than that of rSIG or TSPO alone (both P<0.05). The overall sensitivity and the specificity of the combination were 80.0% and 92.0%, respectively. The rSIG value and serum TSPO level was significantly negatively correlated in sTBI patients (r=-0.439, P<0.05).

Incremental prognostic value of the activated partial thromboplastin time and creatinine in addition to the CRASH score in traumatic brain injury patients,De Amorim R.L.O.; Solla D.J.F.; Teixeira M.J.; Paiva W.S. ,"Introduction: The CRASH score is one of the main validated prognostic models for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This and other TBI scores have underevaluated laboratory variables, including coagulopathy markers, which have been implicated on trauma outcomes. We have previously identified the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and Creatinine (Cr) as independent predictors of TBI mortality after adjustment for the CRASH score. Objective(s): To verify the incremental prognostic value of the aPTT and Cr in addition to the CRASH score to predict 14-day mortality outcome in TBI patients. Method(s): This is a prospective cohort that included consecutive TBI patients admitted to a Trauma ICU of a tertiary university hospital from March 2012-January 2015. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were registered. A new model, CRASH-aPTT-Cr, was created by logistic regression adjustment and compared to the original CRASH score (CT model) regarding calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [HL] and Brier scores), discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] and integrated discrimination improvement [IDI]) and clinical utility (net reclassification index [NRI]). Result(s): A total 519 patients were included (mean age 41.4 [+/-18.2] years, 85.1% male, median admission GCS 8 [quartiles 6-13]). Neurosurgery was performed on 44.9%. The 14-day mortality was 22.8%. The CRASH-aPTT-Cr score outperformed the CRASH score on calibration, as assessed by the H-L test or the Brier scores (0.118 +/- 0.216 vs 0.132 +/- 0.228, mean difference 0.015, 95% CI 0.004-0.026, p = 0.006). The CRASH-aPTT-Cr score also had a better discrimination: AUC-ROC 0.844 +/- 0.024 (vs 0.813 +/- 0.024), p = 0.067; and IDI 0.32 +/- 0.07 (vs 0.23 +/- 0.06), p = 0.004. The NRI favored the CRASH-aPTT-Cr, with a net correct reclassification of 11.5% (95%CI 5.2-17.5%). Conclusion(s): The addition of the aPTT and Cr to the CRASH score increased its accuracy. The aPTT may be an early marker of coagulopathy and the Cr a marker of basal frailty.

The application of marker like procalcitonin (PCT) for TBI may be useful. This study was undertaken with primary objective to determine the correlation between serial PCT concentrations with the outcome at discharge or mortality. Secondary objectives were to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay. Methods 186 TBI patients aged >18yrs admitted to the neuro ICU at the level 1 trauma centre were prospectively enrolled and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. Patients were managed according to standard institutional protocol. The PCT values (on days 1, 2 and 5 after trauma), all clinical, microbiological, laboratory data along with all diagnostic, therapeutic interventions with the duration of treatment in the ICU were noted and outcome assessed using GOS-E. Appropriate statistical analysis was done. Results Median PCT level at admission, day 2 and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng/ml. Regression analysis of primary mortality with PCT cut-off values at admission (>5.5 ng/ml) and on day 2 (>1.16ng/ml). But for secondary mortality, PCT cut-off values at admission (>2.17 ng/ml), on day 2 (>1.16 ng/ml) and on day 5 (>1.2 ng/ml) were derived significant. However, for primarily CNS cause of mortality PCT cut-off level more than 5.5 ng/ml carried maximum AUC of 75% and for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, cut-off values more than 1.2 ng/ml had sensitivity or specificity of 68%. Conclusions Admission PCT of >5.5 ng/ml in TBI patients is associated with high risk for mortality and poor outcome.

Prognostication of in-hospital mortality in maximally treated moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients including ICU complications: The mortality in moderate-severe TBI plus ICU-complications (MYSTIC)-score,Muehlschlegel S.; Flahive J.; Osgood M.; Carandang R.; Hall W.; Goldberg R. ,"Introduction Validated outcome models of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI), such as the IMPACT- or CRASH-models, include only admission characteristics and lack adjustment for early (<24h) deaths or limitations-of-care. Yet, msTBI patients commonly have prolonged intensive-care-unit(ICU)-stays suffering from many ICU complications, lending to the hypothesis that these may be additionally associated with outcome. The objective of this study was to create a multidimensional prognostication tool in maximally treated msTBI patients that includes ICU complications and hospital admission factors. Methods We analyzed 431 msTBI patients consecutively and prospectively enrolled in the observational OPTIMISM-study at a level-1 trauma center between 11/2009-1/2017, which collects 27 pre-defined ICU complications. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in addition to validated admission predictors in 380 maximally treated patients without early (<24h) death or limitations-of-care. Based on the model's parameter estimates, we constructed the MortalitY in Moderate-Severe TBI plus ICU-Complications (MYSTIC)-Score and tested its discrimination and calibration using the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow-goodness-of-fit test. Results The MYSTIC-Score ranged from 26-184, with higher scores indicating higher likelihood of mortality. This score included patient's age, Marshall-CT-score, motor Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary reactivity, pre-hospital hypotension, presence of traumatic SAH or epidural hematoma (all on admission), brain edema, herniation, Systemic-Inflammatory-Response-Syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, and urinary tract infection (all in ICU). Mortality for score deciles 1-10 was present in 2, 3, 5, 12, 26, 36, 34, 60, 95 and 100% at discharge. The score's discrimination and calibration were excellent (AUC=0.94; Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value=0.17, with p>0.05 indicating good calibration). Conclusions The MYSTIC-Score is the first clinical tool to predict the risk of dying in the hospital in maximally treated msTBI patients including ICU complications. Future plans include the formation of a prognostication score for long-term functional outcomes after msTBI and external validation of the score.",2018,/,Neurocritical Care,29,1 Supplement,S98,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0606-9,631894929,#21504,Muehlschlegel 2018,,yes
Early versus late effects of marriage and employment status on traumatic brain injury,Coonfield L.; Griffen M.; Seoudi H.; Ling G.; Newcomb A.; Aizon A.; Smith K.; Brannan T.; Ecklund J. ,"Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition with a wide spectrum of injury severity and outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of this condition and the high cost associated with treatment, there is interest in identifying prognostic factors. In this study, we collected NINDS-recommended common data elements for TBI to determine if these data points could be used to produce an individualized risk stratification scheme. Methods We prospectively collected data from 65 hospitalized patients between ages 18-80 who were diagnosed with TBI within 30 days of enrollment. Subjects were interviewed at 3 months after discharge. Results Out of 65 subjects, four died within the follow up period. The mean age of subjects was 56.9+/-19.3(SD) years. Based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) taken at the time of presentation to the emergency department, the distribution of injury severity in our sample was 78.5% mild, 1.5% moderate, and 20.0% severe. Male gender was found to be predictive of injury severity based on Head-AIS (p<0.001). Male gender, age, marital status, and injury cause were found to be predictive of injury severity based on lowest GCS recorded during admission (p<0.001, p=0.015, p<0.001, and p=0.024, respectively). Only employment status was found to be a significant factor at 3 months based on Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (p=0.018), Global Severity Index (p=0.007), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (p=0.029) scores. Conclusions This is the first study to our knowledge providing evidence that marital status is a predictor of TBI injury severity. Conversely, employment status was a predictor of 3 month follow up survey scores but not of injury severity. Future studies are needed to assess subjects earlier in the periacute period to determine when the subgroups converge. As medical costs are highest during this time period, these findings may be relevant to reducing the cost of care.",2018,/,Neurocritical Care,29,1 Supplement,S112,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0606-9,631896721,#21500,Coonfield 2018,,yes
The influence of seizures and periodic discharges on cognitive outcome after brain trauma,Lee H.; Mizrahi M.; Sharma S.; Hartings J.A.; Ngwenya L.B.; Foreman B. ,"Introduction Seizures and brain activity patterns that lie along the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC), including periodic and rhythmic patterns, are common after moderate-to-severe TBI but do not correlate with functional outcome. We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized multicenter trial, which included continuous EEG (cEEG) per protocol, to examine the impact of IIC burden on cognitive outcome. Methods Validated cEEG terminology was used by certified raters blinded to clinical data. IIC was defined as >1.5 Hz lateralized rhythmic delta activity or generalized periodic discharges, and any lateralized periodic discharges or seizures. IIC burden was calculated in Hz/Hr based on published criteria. Cognitive outcome was rated by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychology Status (RBANS) global cognition score (RBANS), which ranges from 40-160 with lower values indicating worse cognitive outcome. A generalized linear model was constructed using Poisson distribution and controlling for known prognostic factors and overall injury severity. Results A total of 152 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI were enrolled and underwent cEEG recording. Of these, 133 survived and 89 underwent 3-month cognitive testing. The mean age was 32.2 (SD +/-13.4) years and 85 (96%) were men. The median (interquartile range) admission GCS was 7 (7-9) and admission ISS was 20 (12-29). A total of 13/89 (14.6%) had IIC patterns or seizures with a median 0.85 Hz-Hr (0.16-2.26) ictal-interictal burden. At 3 months, the median GOSE was 6 (4-8) and the median RBANS score was 80 (73-92). The IIC burden was correlated with the global cognition score (r=-0.57, p=0.04) and was independently associated with global cognition after controlling for core predictor variables and injury severity (OR 0.94, 95CI 0.90-0.98; p=0.002).

Traumatismo craneoencefalico leve Mild head injury,Zufiria J.M.O.; Prieto N.L.; Cuba B.C.; Degenhardt M.T.; Nunez P.P.; Serrano M.R.L.; Raigada A.B.L. ,"Introduction: Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health concern, because a sizeable number of patients with mild TBI will develop potentially life-threatening complications. The target of this study was to describe a large series of adult patients suffering from mild TBI, treated at University Hospital of Getafe, between 2010 and 2015 (n = 2480). We examined the patients' epidemiological and baseline clinical profile, diagnosis, treatment and ultimate outcomes, to identify major prognostic factors that influence th e final result. Method(s): We retrospectively extracted patient data from medical records and performed both bivariate and multivariate statistics. Result(s): In our sample, mild TBI was more common in men, and the most common causative mechanism was a traffic accident. We proposed a model for classifying patients according to risk, dividing them into low, intermediate and high risk, based upon their baseline clinical picture. This classification scheme correlated well with final outcomes. We investigated indications for skull radiography and computed tomography (CT), as well as for hospital admission for clinical observation. Conclusion(s): In this study, the presence of a neurological focus on clinical examination, the existence of a fracture on plain radiographs, advanced age and the presence of a coagulation disorder were associated with the increased likelihood of intracranial complications and a poor prognosis. The Glasgow Coma Scale was deficient predicting patient outcomes, because it failed to account for concussion-related symptoms like amnesia and loss of consciousness, both very common in patients with mild TBI.Copyright © 2018 Surgical Neurology International  Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",2018,/,Surgical Neurology International,9,Supplement 1,S16-S28,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/sni.sni-371-17,621079956,#21462,Zufiria 2018,,yes
A cross-study analysis for reproducible sub-classification of traumatic brain injury,Si B.; Dumkrieger G.; Wu T.; Zafonte R.; Dodick D.W.; Schwedt T.J.; Li J. ,"Objective: To identify reproducible sub-classes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that correlate with patient outcomes. Method(s): Two TBI datasets from the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System were utilized, Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot and Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT). Patients included in these analyses had closed head injuries with Glasgow Comas Scale (GCS) scores of 13-15 at arrival at the Emergency Department (ED). Sparse hiearchical clustering was applied to identify TBI sub-classes within each dataset. The reproducibility of the sub-classes was evaluated by investigating similarities in clinical variable profiles and patient outcomes in each sub-class between the two datasets, as well as by using a statistical metric called in-group proportion (IGP). Result(s): Seven TBI sub-classes were identified in the first dataset. There were between-class differences in patient outcomes at 90 days (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE): p < 0.001) and 180 days (Trail Making Test (TMT): p = 0.03). Four of seven sub-classes were reproducible in the second dataset with very high IGPs (94, 100, 99, 97%). Seven TBI sub-classes were also identified in the second dataset. There were significant between-class differences in patient outcomes at 180 days (GOSE: p = 0.024; Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) p = 0.007; TMT: p < 0.001). Three of seven sub-classes were reproducible in the second dataset with very high IGPs (100% for all). Conclusion(s): Reproducible TBI sub-classes were identified across two independent datasets, suggesting that these sub-classes exist in a general population. Differences in patient outcomes according to sub-class assignment suggest that this sub-classification could be used to guide post-TBI prognosis.Copyright © 2018 Si, Dumkrieger, Wu, Zafonte, Dodick, Schwedt and Li.",2018,/,Frontiers in Neurology,9,AUG,606,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00606,623492526,#21445,Si 2018,,yes
Dynamic changes in growth factor levels over a 7-day period predict the functional outcomes of traumatic brain injury,Zhou S.; Yin D.-P.; Wang Y.; Tian Y.; Wang Z.-G.; Zhang J.-N. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in poor functional outcomes and death, and overall outcomes are varied. Growth factors, such as angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), play important roles in the neurological functions. This study investigated the relationship between serum growth factor levels and long-term outcomes after TBI. Blood samples from 55 patients were collected at 1, 3 and 7 days after TBI. Blood samples from 39 healthy controls were collected as a control group. Serum Ang-1, G-CSF, and VEGF levels were measured using ELISA. Patients were monitored for 3 months using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Patients having a GOSE score of > 5 at 3 months were categorized as a good outcome, and patients with a GOSE score of 1-5 were categorized as a bad outcome. Our data demonstrated that TBI patients showed significantly increased growth factor levels within 7 days compared with healthy controls. Serum levels of Ang-1 at 1 and 7 days and G-CSF levels at 7 days were significantly higher in patients with good outcomes than in patients with poor outcomes. VEGF levels at 7 days were remarkably higher in patients with poor outcomes than in patients with good outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the best cut-off points of serum growth factor levels at 7 days to predict functional outcome were 1,333 pg/mL for VEGF, 447.2 pg/mL for G-CSF, and 90.6 ng/mL for Ang-1. These data suggest that patients with elevated levels of serum Ang-1, G-CSF, and decreased VEGF levels had a better prognosis in the acute phase of TBI (within 7 days).

International classification of diseases-based audit of the injury database to understand the injury distribution in patients who have sustained a head injury (International Classification of Diseases Codes: S00-S09),Singh M.; Pal R.; Yarasani P.; Bhandarkar P.; Munivenkatappa A.; Agrawal A. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and disability globally. Methods for a reliable prediction of outcomes on the admission of TBI cases are of great clinical relevance to stakeholders. Objective(s): This study used the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes (S00-S09) for analysis of injury distribution of TBI patients and attempted to find the prognostic predictors of Glasgow coma scale (GCS) in the outcome from readily accessible parameters. Method(s): The data were reanalyzed from the Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO) project from India. TITCO is the prospective, observational, multicenter trauma registry, contained data of trauma patients admitted to four public university hospitals in Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata collected from October 2013 to September 2015. Result(s): Among 8525 cases under study, low GCS scores before admission, which was dependent on the demographic variables and related risk factors occurring at the time of injury, were important in the prognostic predictors of mortality. However, survival probability during hospitalization remained uniformly uncertain for the elderly. Death as outcome of injury was dependent on the average intensity of injury, GCS on admission, critical injury severity score, and intubation within 1 h of admission and between 1 and 24 h of admission. These factors emerged as the independent predictors of fatality. The time of the day of injury did not yield any significant association with low GCS or demise in our study. Conclusion(s): GCS <8, i.e., severe at the time of admission, was an unfavorable predictor of in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2018 Medknow Publications.All rights reserved.",2018,/,"Journal of Emergencies, Trauma and Shock",11,4,253-264,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/JETS.JETS_90_17,625438898,#21414,Singh 2018,,yes
Modified revised trauma-marshall score as a proposed tool in predicting the outcome of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury,Mahadewa T.G.B.; Golden N.; Saputra A.; Ryalino C. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common healthcare problem related to disability. An easy-to-use trauma scoring system informs physicians about the severity of trauma and helps to decide the course of management. The purpose of this study is to use the combination of both physiological and anatomical assessment tools that predict the outcome and develop a new modified prognostic scoring system in TBIs. Patients and Methods: A total of 181 subjects admitted to the emergency department (ED) of Sanglah General Hospital were documented for both Marshall CT scan classification score (MCTC) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS) upon admission. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was then documented at six months after brain injury. A new Modified Revised Trauma-Marshall score (m-RTS) was developed using statistical analytic methods. Result(s): The total sample enrolled for this study was 181 patients. The mean RTS upon admission was 10.2+/-1.2. Of the 181 subjects, 110 (60.8%) were found to have favorable GOS (GOS score >3). Best Youden's index results were obtained with any of the RTS of <=10 with area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.2542 and with risk ratio of 2.9 (95% CI=1.98-4.28; P=0.001); and Marshall score <=2 with area under ROC curve of 0.2249 with risk ratio of 3.9 (95% CI=2.52-5.89; P=0.001). The RTS-Marshall combination has higher sensitivity with risk ratio of 4.5 (CI 95%=2.55-8.0; P=0.001) for screening tools of unfavorable outcome. The Pearson's correlation between RTS and Marshall classification is 0.464 (P<0.001).

Objective of this study was to investigate the changes of the NLR in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and analyze the relationship between the NLR and TBI outcome. Setting(s): China. Participant(s): A total of 855 patients with severe TBI from January 2007 to April 2012. Design(s): Retrospective. Main Measurement: Data on the NLR and other indicators were collected. After follow-up until death or 1 year, the relationship between the NLR and TBI outcome was analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): The final analysis included 688 patients. There were 508 (73.8%) who had an unfavorable outcome by 1 year after head trauma. The value of the NLR on admission was significantly higher in the unfavorable outcome group than in the favorable outcome group (P <.001). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that higher NLR was associated with an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.100; P <.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the NLR had a sensitivity of 60.2% and a specificity of 71.1% for predicting unfavorable outcome at 1 year on the basis of the best threshold.

Neuroimmunology of Traumatic Brain Injury: A Longitudinal Study of Interdependency of Inflammatory Markers and Heart Rate Variability in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,Deepika A.; Devi B.I.; Shukla D.; Sathyaprabha T.N.; Christopher R.; Ramesh S.S. ,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the interdependency between heart rate variability (HRV) and inflammatory markers in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). A prospective exploratory study was done with a sample size of 89 patients. HRV of these patients was recorded using a telemetric device. The recordings were made on day 1 of the patients' admission into the intensive care unit followed by serial recordings on day 3 and day 10. Serum samples of the patients were also collected on these days for analysis of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The outcome assessment was done using the Disability Rating Scale at discharge and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended at 6 months post-trauma. The data were analyzed by grouping the patients on based on mortality and outcome. In the present study, there was significant subclinical autonomic dysfunction in patients with severe TBI. Among the serum cytokines, levels of IL-10 had a significant impact on outcome. An increase in IL-10 levels correlated with the unfavorable outcome. This study highlights the association between the HRV parameters and immune response. The timely management of both autonomic and immune dysfunction in patients with severe TBI may have an impact in preventing the secondary injury process.© Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,10,1124-1131,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5151,622163401,#21252,Deepika 2018,,yes
Lack of race/ethnicity differences in severe traumatic brain injury mortality,Park S.-M.; Chiu Y.-L.; Gerber L.; Choi K.-E.; Ghajar J.; Rosengart A. ,"Introduction Studies examining outcome in acute brain injury of vascular origin (i.e., ICH, ischemic stroke) as well as investigations on treatment performance in acute coronary patients identified significant racial disparities across various medical specialties and care settings. We were interested in ethnicity-related differences in adult brain trauma patients with respect to variance in admission demographics and treatment course during the acute hospitalization phase. Methods A total 3,125 TBI patients from the prospective New York State TBI-Trac database (20 Level I and 2 Level II trauma centers in New York State; June 2000 to December 2009) were studied. Of those, 632 patients were excluded because of missing data. 2,370 patients were analyzed to identify race/ethnicity differences using two week mortality and by generating 3 independent outcome models: A dichotomized outcome dead versus alive; B stratified outcome by outcomes scenarios: death, GCS 3-5, GCS 6-8 or GCS >9; and C in-hospital course as either worsening, anticipated, or improved. For all binary variables chi-square analysis was employed (mean +/- SD) and associations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR; 95% CI) (SAS 9). Results Whites accounted for 64% (n=1597), Blacks 14% (n=351), Hispanics 16% (n=396) and others 2% (n=26). Prognosticator frequencies were areflexic pupils (30%), abnormal admission CT (84%), male gender (77%), age >60 years (17%), and hypotension on admission (19%). At 14 days 23% (n=638) had died. Analysis of Blacks (15%) versus non-Blacks (85%), Whites (74%) versus non-Whites (26%), and Hispanics (16%) versus non- Hispanics (84%) did not show a statically significant difference along racial and ethnic subgroups after adjustment for all admission prognosticators.

Sleep features on continuous eeg predict neurological recovery from severe traumatic brain injury,Sandsmark D.K.; Kumar M.A.; Woodward C.; Lim M.; Schmitt S.; Park S. ,"Introduction Studies suggest that sleep characteristics detected by electroencephalography (EEG) may be predictive of neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We sought to determine whether sleep features were associated with functional outcome after severe TBI. Methods Medical records of patients admitted with severe TBI from 2009-2013 who underwent >=24 hours of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring within 14 days from injury were reviewed retrospectively. EEG reports were reviewed for sleep elements (vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes) and epileptiform activity. Patient outcomes included discharge disposition and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Logistic regression analysis and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine differences in outcome between patients with and without sleep characteristic Results Mean patient age was 50.2 (range 15-97) years. 83% were men. 64 patients underwent cEEG monitoring (range 24-168 (mean 50.6) hours). Sleep features could be determined for 58 patients (90%). 9 (14%) displayed status epilepticus, 5 (8%) electrographic seizures and 12 (19%) epileptiform discharges. Status epilepticus or electrographic seizures were universally associated with a poor outcome (mRS>=4). Sleep characteristics, including vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes, were present in 17 patients (30%) and were associated with better outcome (88% discharged to home or acute rehabilitation- OR 13.0; 95%CI 2.6-64.8); 41% had an mRS< 4; p = 0.01). Lack of sleep elements on cEEG correlated with a poor outcome at hospital discharge (mRS>=4: OR 3.93, p=0.049; 95%CI 1.01-15.4). Similarly, 63% of patients without sleep characteristics died or required transfer to a skilled care facility (p < 0.001). Conclusions These data suggest that the presence of sleep features on EEG in the acute period following severe TBI predict better recovery, while the absence of normal sleep characteristics portend a poor prognosis for hospital discharge.

12-Month outcomes in a cohort of older adults with severe traumatic brain injury admitted to an intensive care unit,Maiden M.J.; Gabbe B.J.; Rosenfeld J.V.; Cameron P.A. ,"Introduction Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and the incidence in older adults (>65 years) is increasing. Older adults have been excluded from most TBI clinical trials and the long-term outcomes of those that receive intensive care are unknown. An understanding of these patients long-term outcomes is vital to aid with management decisions and prognostication. Objectives Describe long-term recovery and predictors of outcome following severe TBI in older adults who have been managed in ICU. Methods All cases of severe TBI (initial GCS<9 and Abbreviated Injury Scale >2) in older adults admitted to ICU were extracted from the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) for the period July 2006 to June 2011. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) assessed by standardised telephone interview 12 months following injury. Multivariate regression models for prediction of outcome were applied to patient demographics, nature of injury, injury severity score (ISS), Charlson comorbidity index, ventilation time, neurosurgery and tracheostomy use. Results 258 patients were admitted to ICU with a mean (SD) age of 75.8 (7.0) years, median length of ICU stay 4 days (IQR 2-9) and ventilation time 51 hrs (IQR 14-139). At 12-months, 246 patients had been followed up; 64% had died (GOS-E 1), 18% were dependent (GOS-E 2-4) and 18% were living independently (GOS-E 5-8) (Figure 1). 14/97 (14%) patients who received neurosurgery and 8/24 (33%) patients who received a tracheostomy were independent at 12 months. Age and ISS were the only significant predictors of outcome. Conclusion Older adults admitted to ICU following severe TBI have a high mortality rate, yet some are living independently at 12-months. Age and injury severity were the only significant prognostic factors.

Surgical management of traumatic brain injury: A comparative-effectiveness study of 2 centers: Clinical article,Hartings J.A.; Vidgeon S.; Strong A.J.; Zacko C.; Vagal A.; Andaluz N.; Ridder T.; Stanger R.; Fabricius M.; Mathern B.; Pahl C.; Tolias C.M.; Bullock M.R. ,"Object. Mass lesions from traumatic brain injury (TBI) often require surgical evacuation as a life-saving measure and to improve outcomes, but optimal timing and surgical technique, including decompressive craniectomy, have not been fully defined. The authors compared neurosurgical approaches in the treatment of TBI at 2 academic medical centers to document variations in real-world practice and evaluate the efficacies of different approaches on postsurgical course and long-term outcome. Methods. Patients 18 years of age or older who required neurosurgical lesion evacuation or decompression for TBI were enrolled in the Co-Operative Studies on Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) at King's College Hospital (KCH, n = 27) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU, n = 24) from July 2004 to March 2010. Subdural electrode strips were placed at the time of surgery for subsequent electrocorticographic monitoring of spreading depolarizations; injury characteristics, physiological monitoring data, and 6-month outcomes were collected prospectively. CT scans and medical records were reviewed retrospectively to determine lesion characteristics, surgical indications, and procedures performed. Results. Patients enrolled at KCH were significantly older than those enrolled at VCU (48 vs 34 years, p < 0.01) and falls were more commonly the cause of TBI in the KCH group than in the VCU group. Otherwise, KCH and VCU patients had similar prognoses, lesion types (subdural hematomas: 30%-35%; parenchymal contusions: 48%-52%), signs of mass effect (midline shift >= 5 mm: 43%-52%), and preoperative intracranial pressure (ICP). At VCU, however, surgeries were performed earlier (median 0.51 vs 0.83 days posttrauma, p < 0.05), bone flaps were larger (mean 82 vs 53 cm2, p < 0.001), and craniectomies were more common (performed in 75% vs 44% of cases, p < 0.05). Postoperatively, maximum ICP values were lower at VCU (mean 22.5 vs 31.4 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Differences in incidence of spreading depolarizations (KCH: 63%, VCU: 42%, p = 0.13) and poor outcomes (KCH: 54%, VCU: 33%, p = 0.14) were not significant. In a subgroup analysis of only those patients who underwent early (< 24 hours) lesion evacuation (KCH: n = 14; VCU: n = 16), however, VCU patients fared significantly better. In the VCU patients, bone flaps were larger (mean 85 vs 48 cm2 at KCH, p < 0.001), spreading depolarizations were less common (31% vs 86% at KCH, p < 0.01), postoperative ICP values were lower (mean: 20.8 vs 30.2 mm Hg at KCH, p < 0.05), and good outcomes were more common (69% vs 29% at KCH, p < 0.05). Spreading depolarizations were the only significant predictor of outcome in multivariate analysis. Conclusions. This comparative-effectiveness study provides evidence for major practice variation in surgical management of severe TBI. Although ages differed between the 2 cohorts, the results suggest that a more aggressive approach, including earlier surgery, larger craniotomy, and removal of bone flap, may reduce ICP, prevent cortical spreading depolarizations, and improve outcomes. In particular, patients requiring evacuation of subdural hematomas and contusions may benefit from decompressive craniectomy in conjunction with lesion evacuation, even when elevated ICP is not a factor in the decision to perform surgery. ©AANS, 2014.",2014,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,120,2,434-446,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2013.9.JNS13581,372280060,#23339,Hartings 2014,,yes
Prognostic factors of recovery and reemployment in adults after traumatic brain injury,Ontiveros A.; Preciado A.K.; Matute Villasenor E.; Lopez-Cruz M.; Lopez-Elizalde R. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents the leading cause of death in people between 15 and 45 years of age, and it is the first cause of disability world wide. One third of all patients who suffer non-fatal injuries present cognitive, motor, emotional or behavioral deficits that renders social reinsertion difficult. The objective of this paper is to present an analysis of the scientific literature on the prognostic factors related to recovery and return to work after traumatic brain injury. These prognostic factors are divided into three categories: those that exist before brain damage, those associated with brain damage, and those related to long-term adjustments.

Ocular manifestations of head injury and incidence of post-traumatic ocular motor nerve involvement in cases of head injury: A clinical review,Sharma B.; Gupta R.; Anand R.; Ingle R. ,"As the eyes are in close proximity to the skull, they can get simultaneously affected in head injuries. This close association warrants careful ocular examination in all cases of head injury. This is a prospective non-randomized analytical study to evaluate various ocular manifestations in cases of head injury with special reference to ocular motor nerve involvement, correlation between pupillary changes, and survival. A total of 1,184 patients with head injury were screened for ocular manifestations. This study comprises 594 patients with ocular manifestations of head injury. All the relevant data was compiled and analyzed as per proforma. Ocular manifestations were evaluated in each patient and appropriate investigations were carried out. Patients with ocular morbidity were analyzed for age, sex, mode of injury, Glasgow Coma Score, and associated injuries in addition to ophthalmic and neurosurgical evaluations. Of the 594 patients, 81.6 % were male and 18.4 % were female, with a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. The major cause of head injury was road traffic accidents (70.37 %). The most common age group involved was, 21-40-year-olds (67.40 %). Out of 594 patients, ecchymosis was found in 51.85 %, subconjunctival hemorrhage in 44.44 %, lid edema in 41.48 %, lacerated wound in 22.59 %, pupillary involvement in 21.04 %, ptosis in 6.73 %, cranial nerve palsy in 11.62 %, orbital fractures in 10.44 %, optic nerve trauma in 4.04 %, and exposure keratitis in 4.21 %. Patients with bilaterally dilated or pinpoint fixed pupils had a 10 times higher risk of mortality than patients without pupillary involvement.

Serum S100B protein as an outcome prediction tool in emergency department patients with traumatic brain injury,Abbasi M.; Sajjadi M.; Fathi M.; Maghsoudi M. ,"Objectives: Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of death and disability worldwide. Early recognition of patients with brain cellular damage allows for early rehabilitation and patient outcome improvement. Method(s): In this prospective study, the clinical conditions of patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) were assessed, and patient serum S100B levels were measured. Patients were followed up one month later and evaluated for level of consciousness, presence or absence of post-traumatic headache, and daily activity performance (using the Barthel scale). Student's t-test and the chi-square test were used for data analysis, which was performed using SPSS software. Result(s): The mean serum S100B value was significantly lower for patients with minor TBI than for patients with moderate TBI (23.1+/-14.2 ng/dl and 134.0+/-245.0 ng/dl, respectively). Patients with normal CT scans also had statistically significantly lower serum S100B levels than patients with abnormal CT findings. The mean S100B value was statistically significantly higher for patients with suspected diffused axonal injury (632.18+/-516.1 ng/dl) than for patients with other abnormal CT findings (p=0.000): 24.97+/-22.9 ng/dl in patients with normal CT results; 41.56+/-25.7 ng/dl in patients with skull bone fracture; 57.38 +/-28.9 ng/ dl in patients with intracranial hemorrhage; and 76.23+/-38.3 ng/dl in patients with fracture plus intracranial hemorrhage).

High plasma adiponectin levels in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Shen L.-J.; Yang S.-B.; Lv Q.-W.; Zhang G.-H.; Zhou J.; Guo M.; Huang H.-B.; Li Z.; Yang C.-S. ,"Background: Adiponectin plays an important role in the regulation of tissue inflammation. There is a paucity of data on circulating plasma adiponectin concentrations in human traumatic brain injury. This study is designed to investigate the potential associations between plasma adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Method(s): Plasma adiponectin levels of 86 patients with severe traumatic brain injury and 86 healthy subjects were determined. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3). Result(s): Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients compared to controls (20.5. +/-. 5.9 vs. 7.7. +/-. 2.0. mug/ml; P<. 0.001) and emerged as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR), 1.318; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.049-1.629; P=. 0.008], 6-month mortality (OR, 1.328; 95% CI, 1.082-1.657; P=. 0.007) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (OR, 1.240; 95% CI, 1.066-1.443; P=. 0.005) in a multivariate analysis. For predicting these clinical outcomes, areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of plasma adiponectin level were similar to those of Glasgow Coma scale scores (all P>. 0.05). However, adiponectin did not improve predictive values of Glasgow Coma scale scores (all P>. 0.05).

Prognostic importance of serum S100 protein (B dimer) in patients with severe head trauma,Foulady P.; Shakeri M.; Yarand K.K.; Bazzazi A.M. ,"The serum level of SI OOB has been proposed as an indicator of prognosis in head trauma; however, there are scant reports in this regard. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serum SI OOB in patients with severe head trauma. In a cross-sectional, prospective study, 72 patients with severe head trauma (Glasgow coma scale = 8) were recruited from Tabriz Imam Reza Teaching Center from September 2009 to December 2011. Serum level of S100B was measured on admission, 48 h later and at discharge/decease by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. According to their in-hospital outcome, the patients were categorized as discharged (group A, n = 42), expired due to cerebral injury (group B, n = 16) and expired due to non-cerebral causes (group C, n = 14). The three groups were comparable in terms of age and sex. While the mean level of serum SI OOB was not significantly different between the three groups on admission and at the time of discharge/decease, it was significantly higher in group B (2.4+/-1 muU mL-1) than in groups A (1.0+/-0.5 muU mL-1) and C (1.5+/-0.5 muU mL-1)48 h after discharge (p = 0.001). Serum S100B levels on all three occasions were significantly correlated with Glasgow Coma scale in a reverse fashion. According to the Marshall grading system, the brain trauma was of grade I, II, III, IV and V in 18, 16, 13, 13 and 12 cases, respectively. The mean level of the serum SI OOB was significantly higher in grade V only when it was measured 48 h after admission (p = 0.02). In conclusion, serum level of SI OOB is a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with severe head trauma, when it is measured after 48 h of admission.

Comparison of several prognostic tools in traumatic brain injury including S100B,Lesko M.M.; O'Brien S.J.; Childs C.; Bouamra O.; Rainey T.; Lecky F. ,"Primary objective: To identify which tool (a model, a biomarker or a combination of these) has better prognostic strength in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design and methods: Data of 100 patients were analysed. TBI prognostic model B, constructed in Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN), was run on the dataset and then S100B was added to this model. Another model was developed containing only S100B and, subsequently, other important predictors were added to assess the enhancement of the predictive power. The outcome measures were survival and favourable outcome. Result(s): No difference between performance of the prognostic model or S100B in isolation is observed. Addition of S100B to the prognostic model improves the performance (e.g. AUC, R2 Nagelkerke and classification accuracy of TARN model B to predict survival increase respectively from 0.66, 0.11 and 70% to 0.77, 0.25 and 75%). Similarly, the predictive power of S100B increases by adding other predictors (e.g. AUC (0.69 vs. 0.79), R2 Nagelkerke (0.15 vs. 0.30) and classification accuracy (73% vs. 77%) for survival prediction). Conclusion(s): A better prognostic tool than those currently available may be a combination of clinical predictors with a biomarker. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Cardiac troponin I in traumatic brain injury: Prognostic implications,Taema K.M.; Hamdi E.; Shehata M.A.; Radwan W. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a major public-health problem. Many research works aimed to identify early predictors of mortality and functional outcome. The cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation has been observed to be associated with an increased risk of mortality in acute non TBI. This study was intended to evaluate the prognostic implication of the cTnI in TBI. Thirty two patients were enrolled in our prospective study, admitted to intensive care units in Cairo university hospitals with TBI. We excluded patients with associated co-morbidities that cause elevation of cTnI from our study. Our patients were stratified according to the severity of the injury using the APACHE II score and Glasgow coma scale (GCS). Three weeks later, outcome was assessed using Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). The cTnI was measured three days after admission. Our population had mean age of 38.0 +/- 10.2 years with 27 males. 87.5% of hemodynamically unstable patients had poor prognosis following TBI compared to only 12.5% who had good prognosis (P:0.004). There were Lower GCS (10 Vs 6; P:0.002) and higher APACHE II score (16.8 Vs 9; P:0.001) in patients with poor prognosis. Patients with poor prognosis exhibited higher cTnI level compared to patients with good prognosis (2.85 mug/L Vs 0.23 mug/L; P:0.001). We found serum level of 0.22 mug/L to be 71.4% sensitive and 89% specific in predicting poor prognosis. We concluded that the elevated cTnI level together with lower GCS, higher APACHE II scores, and the hemodynamic instability, are good predictors for poor outcome after TBI.",2014,/,Cerebrovascular Diseases,37,Supplement 1,231,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000358122,614325927,#23130,Taema 2014,,yes
The prognostic value of serum neuron-specific enolase in traumatic brain injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis,Cheng F.; Yuan Q.; Yang J.; Wang W.; Liu H. ,"Background: Several studies have suggested that neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in serum may be a biomarker of traumatic brain injury. However, whether serum NSE levels correlate with outcomes remains unclear. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the prognostic value of serum NSE protein after traumatic brain injury. Method(s): PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant studies published up to October 2013. Full-text publications on the relationship of NSE to TBI were included if the studies concerned patients with closed head injury, NSE levels in serum after injury, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or Extended GOS (GOSE) scores or mortality. Study design, inclusion criteria, assay, blood sample collection time, NSE cutoff, sensitivity and specificity of NSE for mortality prediction (if sufficient information was provided to calculate these values), and main outcomes were recorded. Result(s): Sixteen studies were eligible for the current meta-analysis. In the six studies comparing NSE concentrations between TBI patients who died and those who survived, NSE concentrations correlated with mortality (M.D. 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21 to 0.34; I255%). In the eight studies evaluating GOS or GOSE, patients with unfavorable outcomes had significantly higher NSE concentrations than those with favorable outcomes (M.D. 0.24, 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.31; I264%). From the studies providing sufficient data, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for mortality were 0.79 and 0.50, and 0.72 and 0.66 for unfavorable neurological prognosis, respectively. The areas under the SROC curve (AUC) of NSE concentrations were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66-0.80) for unfavorable outcome and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.90) for mortality. Conclusion(s): Mortality and unfavorable outcome were significantly associated with greater NSE concentrations. In addition, NSE has moderate discriminatory ability to predict mortality and neurological outcome in TBI patients. The optimal discrimination cutoff values and optimal sampling time remain uncertain because of significant variations between studies.Copyright © 2014 Cheng et al.",2014,/,PLoS ONE,9,9,e106680,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106680,600018086,#23124,Cheng 2014,,yes

Compensatory-Reserve-Weighted Intracranial Pressure and Its Association with Outcome After Traumatic Brain Injury,Calviello L.; Donnelly J.; Cardim D.; Robba C.; Zeiler F.A.; Smielewski P.; Czosnyka M. ,"Objective: We introduced 'compensatory-reserve-weighted intracranial pressure (ICP),' named 'weightedICP' for brevity, as a variable that may better describe changes leading to mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI) over the standard mean ICP. Method(s): ICP was monitored prospectively in over 1023 sedated and ventilated patients. The RAP coefficient (R-correlation, A-amplitude, and P-pressure) was calculated as the running correlation coefficient between slow changes in the pulse amplitude of ICP and the mean ICP. RAP has a value of 0 on the linear part of the pressure-volume curve and a value of + 1 on the ascending exponential part. Then, RAP decreases towards zero or even becomes negative when ICP increases further-a phenomenon thought to be related to the critical closing of cerebral vessels. In this study, we investigated a derived variable called weightedICP, calculated as ICP*(1 - RAP). Result(s): Mortality after TBI was associated with both elevated ICP and weightedICP. Analysis of variance showed higher values of test statistics for weightedICP (K = 93) than for ICP (K = 64) in outcome categorization. Additionally, receiver operator curve analysis indicated greater area under the curve for weightedICP (0.71) than for ICP (0.67) with respect to associated mortality; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). The best threshold (maximizing sensitivity and specificity) was 19.5 mm Hg for mean ICP, and 8 mm Hg for weightedICP. Mortality rate expressed as a function of mean ICP and weightedICP showed an ascending profile in both cases. Conclusion(s): The proposed variable shows a significant association with mortality following head injury. It is sensitive to both the rising absolute ICP and to the critical deterioration of pressure-volume compensation.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2018,/,Neurocritical Care,28,2,212-220,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0475-7,618797846,#21240,Calviello 2018,,yes

Twenty-one (46%) patients died, while 6 (13%) did not regain consciousness. Patients underwent the first neurophysiological evaluations on day 2.8 +/- 2.2. Considering non-reactive EEG pattern and pathological SEP, both measures together classified 70% of the patients into the unfavorable outcome group, after the first neurophysiological evaluation.

Traumatic brain injury in elderly: Impact of frailty on outcome,Zacchetti L.; Aresi S.; Zangari R.; Cavalleri G.; Fagnani L.; Longhi L.; Gritti P.; Ferri F.; Lorini L. ,"Introduction: TBI in elderly is an increasingly cause of admission in ICU. Data regarding management and prognosis of these patients are lacking. Validated prognostic models refer to younger patients and do not adequately consider the influence of pre-injury functional status, which often compromises with aging. Frailty has been defined as a state age-related of increased vulnerability and decline in autonomy of daily life activity. Aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of frailty on outcome in TBI elderly patients. Method(s): moderate and severe TBI patients >65years, admitted in NeuroICU from January 2017 to May 2018, were prospectively enrolled. Data of age, comorbidity, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupils' reactivity, CT scan characteristics, neurosurgical intervention and GOSE (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) at 6-months were collected. Frailty status was measured by Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) [1] and patients were divided as frail (CFS>4) and not frail (CFS<4). Bad outcome was defined as GOSE<4. Result(s): 22(37%) of the 60 studied patients were frail. Frailty was not related to age. Frail patients had more comorbidities and worse pupils' reactivity at admission (Table 1). Other variables did not differ between groups. In univariate analysis neurological diseases, GCS, tSAH (traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage), compressed/absent basal cisterns, non-reactive pupils and CFS were significantly associated to bad outcome.

Oxidative stress and brain injury biomarkers as outcome predictors in severe traumatic brain injury,Gonzalez-Garcia L.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez A.; Sempere-Bordes L.; Boyero-Corral L.; Ferrete-Araujo A.M.; Freire-Aragon M.D.; Vilches-Arenas A.; Egea-Guerrero J.J. ,"Background-aim: Traumatic brain injury (TBI)is a complex disorder of significant public health concern due to its high prevalence and. burden across all ages. Outcome following TBI is heterogeneous and can range from complete recovery to death and. long-term disability. Reactive oxygen species production is increased after TBI. Thus, measurement of total antioxidant capacity (TAC)may. provide more biologically relevant information about prognostic features. Moreover, several proteins are released into. the blood after TBI. One of those proteins is S100B, a calcium-binding protein expressed in glial cells. The objective of our study was to evaluate the ability of serum TAC and S100B protein levels to predict outcome after. severe TBI. Method(s): Patients admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit with the diagnosis of severe TBI (GCS of 3 to 8)were included. Blood. samples taken at the time of hospital admission, 24 and 48 h after trauma were analyzed for TAC and S100B. TAC assay. results were expressed as M copper reducing equivalents (CRE). Outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome. Scale (GOS)at 6 months post injury and patients were divided in two groups: poor functional outcome (GOS = 1-3)and. good functional outcome (GOS = 4-5). Statistical analyses were conducted using software from IBM SPSS. Result(s): We included 70 severe TBI patients, mean age 44.6 +/- 18.6, 81% male. Poor outcome patients (n = 43)presented higher. levels of TAC and S100B than good ones (n = 27), reaching statistical differences the TAC 24 and 48 h samples, and the. S100B 48 h sample: - TAC 24 h: 891.4 M CRE (IQR: 696.8-1313.9)(GOS = 1-3)and 738.3 M CRE (IQR: 498.6-896)(GOS = 4-5): p =.01. - TAC 48 h: 1054.5 M CRE (IQR: 834.3-1389.3)(GOS = 1-3)and 762.1 M CRE (IQR: 473.5-1034.5)(GOS = 4-5): p =.001. - S100B 48 h: 0.199 g/L (IQR: 0.089-0.385)(GOS = 1-3)and 0.125 g/L (IQR: 0.070-0.175)(GOS = 4-5): p =.05. The ROC analysis showed that TAC levels at 24 and 48 h could accurately discriminate between patients with favorable. and unfavorable outcome. The sample that reached a higher AUC was the 48 h one (AUC = 0.749, p =.001). Regarding. S100B levels, the 48 h sample could discriminate between the two groups (AUC = 0.641, p =.05). The best cutoffs. were 942.1 M CRE (TAC)and 0.186 g/L (S100B), with a sensitivity of 72% (IC95% = 50.61-87.93)and 53.9%.

Conclusion(s): Determination of serum levels of TAC and S100B proteins may add value to the clinical assessment of the primary. damage and prediction of outcome after severe TBI. Furthermore, it is worth noting that although TAC is a systemic. marker and S100B is a specific neuronal protein, we observed a greater prognostic value for TAC levels than S100B ones.Copyright © 2019",2019,/,Clinica Chimica Acta,493,Supplement 1,S262-S263,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2019.03.541,2001802876,#21160,Gonzalez-Garcia 2019,,yes
P39-T Predicting outcome in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury using electroencephalography,Haveman M.E.; van Putten M.J.A.M.; Beishuizen A.; Hom H.W.; Eertman-Meyer C.J.; Tjepkema-Cloostermans M.C. ,"Background: We developed a multifactorial model combining quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)measurements and clinically relevant parameters for outcome prediction of patients with moderate to severe TBI. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with moderate to severe TBI were included: a training (n = 38)and validation set (n = 19). Continuous EEG was registrated during the first 7 days of ICU admission. Patient outcome at 12 months was dichotomized as poor (Extended Glasgow Outcome Score, GOSE 1-2)or good (GOSE 3-8). Prediction models were created using a Random Forest classifier based on 23 qEEG features, age and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after TBI and combinations of two time intervals. After optimization, we added parameters from the International Mission for Prognosis And Clinical Trial Design (IMPACT)predictor, comprising core, CT and laboratory parameters at admission. Predictive ability for the prediction of these models was assessed in both training (using leave-one-out)and validation set. Result(s): Our best model used 8 qEEG parameters at 72 and 96 h after TBI, MAP, age and 9 other IMPACT parameters. This model had high predictive ability on both training set (AUC = 0.94, specificity for poor outcome = 100%, sensitivity = 75%)and validation set (AUC = 0.81, specificity = 75%, sensitivity = 100%).

Long term prognosis of severe traumatic brain injured patients using acute phase neurophysiology testing,Bauer J.; Puccio A.; Zusman B.; Panczykowski D.; Balzer J.; Okonkwo D. ,"Introduction: Current prognostic measures for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupillary response, and computerized tomography results; however, their predictive value is limited by confounding variables contributing to outcome and poor inter-rater reliability. Use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) testing in the acute phase may provide a reliable objective mechanism for predicting patient prognosis. Method(s): Under an IRB-approved protocol, prospective clinical and outcome data were collected from all severe TBI patients (Glasgow Coma Score <=8) admitted to UPMC between 2006-2011. SEP recording was performed on post-trauma day 5. N9, N13, P14, N20, and P30 latencies are measured; central conduction time (CCT) is defined as the delay between the P14 peak recorded at the C-2 electrode and the N20 peak recorded at the somatosensory cortex. Peak-to-peak amplitudes measured are of N20/P30 using Fz reference. Criterion for pathologic SEP event was defined as either the reduction of the N20 amplitude below 50% of baseline or the increase of latency between P14 and N20 by 10%. SEPs were graded as bilaterally absent, unilateral absence, bilateral delay >23ms, unilateral delay with normal, and bilateral normal latency. Functional outcome was prospectively collected at 12-month follow-up, and included neurologic status and mortality as assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Result(s): 145 patients were available for analysis. Median GCS was 6 (IQR 2), while median radiographic injury was a Marshall score 3 (IQR 2). Mean age was 38 +/- 16. Univariable ordinal logistic regression analysis of SEP demonstrated significant ordinal prediction of outcome according to GOS; favorable outcome correlated with higher SEP grading [OR = 1.66, 95%CI (1.29-2.13), p = 0.001]. A dichotomized model grouping higher/lower SEP grading significantly predicted favorable/unfavorable outcomes, respectively [OR 4.69, 95%CI (2.36-9.32), p < 0.001]. These findings remained significant regardless of age, admission GCS, or radiographic injury severity (p > 0.59).

"Prognostic factors of intensive treatment for geriatric TBI: Analysis of 1,879 cases from Japan neurotrauma data bank",Yokobori S.; Suehiro E.; Sasaki K.; Igarashi Y.; Nakae R.; Onda H.; Fuse A.; Suzuki M.; Yokota H. ,"With the increase of the elderly population, there has been an abrupt increase of elderly traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in Japan. However, there had been less data on the effectiveness of aggressive treatment and their prognosis in geriatric TBI. The aim of this study was thus to analyze the prognostic factors of aggressive treatments in geriatric TBI with the data of Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank Projects. Of 4,527 cases registered in the four JNTDB projects (from 1998 to 2015), 1,879 geriatric TBI cases (>=65) were analyzed. The clinical features, the percentage of aggressive treatment defined as surgical procedure and/or intensive temperature treatment including ICP monitoring, and outcomes based on Glasgow Outcome Scale were compared among four study projects. To clarify the prognostic factors in aggressively treated geriatric TBI patients, logistic regression analysis was performed. The percentage of geriatric TBI population was significantly increased throughout projects. (P1998; 30.1%, P2015 53.6% p < 0.0001). Aggressive treatments including surgical management and targeted temperature management (TTM) were performed in 69.3% in P2015 and this percentage was significantly increased. Less invasive treatments, like as trephination and TTM, tend to be chosen for geriatric patients. Mortality was significantly decreased (P1998; 62.8%, P2015; 44.7%, <0.0001), however the percentage of severe disability was significantly increased. Intraventricular hemorrhage was the strongest unfavorable prognostic factor (OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.05 +/- 7.76, < 0.0001). Conclusively, our efforts with the aggressive, less invasive treatments provided less mortality in geriatric TBI patients. However, these efforts did not result in better functional outcome in this population. Multimodal specific treatment strategy, like as rehabilitation and regenerative therapy, should be established.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A21,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628867144,#21125,Yokobori 2019,,yes
Data driven approaches for syndromic biomarkers in the laboratory and clinic,Huie J.R. ,"The complex and heterogeneous nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has rendered the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers elusive. A single acute biomarker may not be sufficient to categorize injury severity and/or predict outcome. Using multivariate dimension reduction analyses, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of a multianalyte panel of proteins as an ensemble biomarker for TBI. Serum was collected within 24 hours of injury in a cohort of 130 patients enrolled in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) prospective pilot trial, and run on an array that measured 72 proteins. Using unsupervised principal components analysis we first identified the subset of proteins accounting for the most variance across patients. This yielded a group of 21 proteins that reflected an inverse relationship between inflammatory cytokines and regulators of antiinflammation, and generated an individual inflammatory profile score for each patient. We then tested the association between these scores and CT findings at hospital admission, as well as their prognostic association with functional recovery measures at 3 and 6 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended) and cognitive recovery at 6 months (California Verbal Learning Test) after injury. Inflammatory signatures were significantly increased in patients with positive CT findings, as well as in those that showed poor or incomplete recovery. Inflammation biomarker scores also showed significant sensitivity and specificity as a discriminator of these outcome measures (all AUCs >0.62). This proof-of-concept for the feasibility of multivariate biomarker identification demonstrates the prognostic validity of using a proteomic panel as a potential biomarker for TBI.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A150,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628867591,#21122,Huie 2019,,yes
The potential for blood-based biomarkers to inform the interpretation of microstructural damage following traumatic brain injury,Lazarus R.; Turner S.; Main K.; Marion D. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a significant challenge for military health care. An incidence of TBI is not an isolated event, but is better classified as a disease. While most patients recover in a matter of weeks, a nontrivial number continue to experience symptoms months or even years after injury. Biomarkers of TBI, such as neural proteins detectable in the blood or microstructural pathology detectable with imaging techniques, have been and continue to be heavily researched as objective indices of injury. Bloodbased biomarker assay development and detection technology is rapidly improving, allowing for identification of extremely minute concentrations of specific proteins. Originally investigated as diagnostic markers, it is increasingly apparent that blood-based biomarkers may also be used to assess TBI recovery, prognosticate post-concussive symptoms, facilitate treatment plans, and perhaps even identify those most at risk for sustaining a TBI. Likewise, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology is rapidly advancing to the point where the integrity of axons following a TBI can be inferred. Microimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) all can detect TBI-related abnormalities in brain white matter. However, it remains unclear how particular physical indices measured by imaging-for example, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)-are related to the pathobiological consequence of TBI at the cellular level. While stereotypical patterns of MD and FA are observed as a function of time following injury, it is unclear how these patterns relate to injury severity, symptomatology, and the likelihood of ongoing neuronal dysfunction. Microimaging techniques are particularly sensitive to axonal injury, and certain blood-based protein biomarkers, including tau and NF-L, are integral to the axonal structure and function. Here, we describe the state of the science on the relationship between blood-based and imaging biomarkers in relation to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury from the acute to chronic stage.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A28,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628867988,#21120,Lazarus 2019,,yes
Time interval to emergence from coma in severe traumatic brain injury survivors with favorable outcome at 2 years,Puccio A.; Wilkins T.; Beers S.; Borrasso A.; Chang Y.; Okonkwo D. ,"Background: Pessimism of acute care clinicians regarding prognosis in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients often leads to variability in rates of early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Recent literature regarding the aggressive care following sTBI demonstrates a more favorable outlook than is broadly appreciated. Patients who do not begin following commands in the first few days after sTBI are at risk for premature withdrawal of care. In our prospective observational database of sTBI patients, we analyzed the time interval to following commands in patients with favorable outcomes at 2 years after injury. Method(s): Under an IRB-approved protocol, we queried the prospective, observational Brain Trauma Research Center database to identify sTBI patients with favorable neurologic outcomes at 2 years post injury (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score >=4). Demographic, clinical, and imaging data during the acute hospitalization was analyzed, including: time to follow commands, length of mechanical ventilation, and initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Neurological outcome data at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months was extracted. Result(s): Adult sTBI patients with favorable outcomes at 24 months (n= 127; mean age = 34 +/- 14; 76% male; mean initial GCS = 6) were analyzed. The mean time to follow commands was 10 days (range 1- 78d); mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 12 days (range 1- 39d). There was a significant correlation between time to follow commands and length of mechanical ventilation 0.50 ( p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between time to follow commands and initial GCS or time to follow commands and GOS-E at 24 months, nor between CT Marshall Classification and GOS-E at 24 months. Conclusion(s): In a cohort of sTBI patients with favorable outcomes at 2 years, mean time to following commands after injury was 10 days. Decisions of early withdrawal of care in comatose patients after trauma should be weighed against the temporal profile of recovery.

Relationship of metabolomic profile and functional trajectory following mild traumatic brain injury in older adults,Thompson H.; Rivara F.; Temkin N.; Becker K.; Maier R. ,"Background: Aging can alter normal physiologic processes. At present, little is known about metabolic signatures following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in older adults and how these may relate to outcome. Method(s): Subjects (55 years and above) with mild TBI (n = 14) had plasma samples obtained at <24 hours, 3, 7 day, 1- 3- and 6-months post injury. Functional outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) was assessed at 3 and 6 months postinjury. Non-injured controls (n = 10) had samples taken at baseline, 1 and 6 months. For metabolomic analyses, we used a LC-MS aqueous global profiling approach. Data were analyzed using splines to fit the data as a function of time for exposure (injury vs. control) and outcome. A false discovery rate of 0.1 was used. Result(s): For the exposure comparison, expression patterns differed over time between older mTBI and control groups for 179 metabolites. In examining the pattern of abundance in the underlying data, while the individual level data track with the fitted splines, the data are noted to frequently have significant variability. For the outcome comparison, there were differences in abundance of 42 metabolites between persons with a trajectory of improving GOSE following TBI (n = 6) and controls. There were differences in abundance of only 2 metabolites between older mTBI patients with worsening (n = 8) and improving GOS-E score to 6 months post-injury. Discussion(s): This initial exploratory study has identified several potential metabolic biomarkers and metabolic signatures to be of interest for future study. These metabolites may be useful for both therapeutic and prognostic purposes.

Adaptive immune responses in traumatic brain injury,Menon D.; Needham E.; Helmy A.; Hutchinson P.; Wang K.; Jones J.; Coles A. ,"Introduction: There is significant unexplained heterogeneity in outcome from traumatic brain injury (TBI), with prognostic models accounting for only around one third of variation. Differential immunological responses represent a potentially therapeutically modifiable contributor to secondary injury. We hypothesise that a proportion of TBI patients develop autoantibodies to brain antigens, which associate with poor outcome. Method(s): We developed a protein microarray to detect autoantibodies against brain antigens in TBI patients. We screened serum for autoantibodies at day 0-2 and one week after injury in 25 patients with moderate to severe TBI, and at 6-9 months in a further 21 patients. In addition, we assessed the effect of treatment with recombinant IL1RA on early autoantibody production using serum from 20 patients recruited to a phase 1 study using IL1RA treatment in TBI. Result(s): IgM and IgG autoantibody responses were seen in twothirds of patients by day 7, and a similar proportion demonstrated persisting IgG autoantibodies at 6-9 months. There was marked interindividual variation, with a distinct subset demonstrating a tendency to autoimmunity. The presence of both IgM and IgG autoantibodies individually and summatively provided significant independent prognostic predictive value when combined in a multivariable regression model with the IMPACT prognostic score, increasing R2 against GOSE from 0.119 (IMPACT alone) to 0.19 (IgM; p = 0.012), 0.253 (IgG; p = 0.035), 0.381 (combined; p = 0.031). IgG responses were driven largely by magnitude of protein release (GFAP autoantibody vs GFAP protein: R2 = 0.464, p = 0.001), and are markedly attenuated by treatment with recombinant IL1RA (mean IgG hits 0.1 vs 0.6; p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): Autoantibodies to brain antigens develop after TBI in a subset of patients and appear to independently associate with poor outcome. The development of IgG autoantibodies can be reduced using IL1RA, suggesting it may represent a therapeutically modifiable component of secondary injury.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A119,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628868192,#21116,Menon 2019,,yes
Temporal acute serum estradiol and tumor necrosis factor-a associations with mortality after severe traumatic brain injury,Weppner J.; Kumar R.G.; DiSanto D.; Wright D.W.; Berga S.L.; Conley Y.P.; Brooks M.M.; Wagner A.K. ,"Individuals with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are at risk for systemic compromise and acute mortality. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a mediator between systemic shock and an extra-gonadal transcription factor for estradiol (E2) production, a prognostic marker of mortality after severe TBI. The study objectives were to test the hypothesis that acute serum concentrations of E2 and TNFalpha are interrelated and prognostic indicators of mortality after severe TBI. For n = 157 adults with severe TBI, serum samples were collected for the first five days' post-injury. TNFalpha and E2 levels were averaged into 2 time epochs: first 72 hours (T1) and second 72 hours' post-injury (T2). Crosslagged panel analysis showed significant acute interrelationships between E2 and TNFalpha. Cox proportional hazards multivariable regression models determined that increases in T1 E2 (HR= 1.82, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.89), but not T2 E2 (HR= 0.91, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.47), were associated with increased risk for mortality. Increases in T2 TNFalpha (HR= 2.55, 95% CI: 1.40, 4.64), and T1 TNFalpha (HR= 1.46, 95% CI: 0.99, 2.17) to a lesser degree, were associated with increased mortality risk. Individuals experiencing cardiovascular dysfunction had significantly higher 6-month mortality rates compared to those without CV dysfunction (43.2% versus 17.3%). Overall, 20.7% of the association between T1 E2 and mortality and 21.9% of the association between T2 TNFalpha and mortality were explained by CV dysfunction as defined by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.

Post-acute systemic inflammatory biomarkers and cognition after TBI: A follow-up study,Milleville K.; Kumar R.; Disanto D.; Wagner A. ,"Cognitive impairment is a large contributor to traumatic brain injury (TBI) disability, yet few studies have examined the relationship between inflammation and cognition post-TBI. Thus, we examined prospective relationships of post-acute, serum inflammatory markers with cognitive performance at 6 and 12-months for adults after moderate-to-severe TBI, using a weighted inflammatory load score (wILS) evaluating serum inflammation levels from 2 weeks to 3 months post-injury. Subjects completed neuropsychological testing at 6 (n= 118) and 12 (n = 121) months post-injury. Nine neuropsychological measures tested the domains of verbal fluency, memory, attention/processing speed, and executive function. Overall composite scores were created as an average of normalized mean T-scores for each cognitive domain. Domain-specific and overall cognition wILS were generated. wILS values were generated using a 2-step process wherein associations between standardized serum cytokine levels, and composite scores were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Standardized markers (p < 0.10) were then multiplied by regression-derived beta-values and summed to generate each wILS. Multivariable linear regression included co-variate adjusted associations between wILS and composite scores. wILS captured 8.43% and 10.36% additional variance for overall composite score at 6 and 12 months. For each 1-unit increase in wILS, overall composite T-scores increased by beta = 1.029 (p = 0.0005) and beta = 0.903 (p=<.0001) at 6 and 12 months. Domain-specific wILS discriminated performance on domain-specific composite scores including memory, verbal fluency, attention/processing speed, and executive function. Results show post-acute inflammatory profiles are associated with cognitive performance at 6 and 12-months post-TBI. Compared to our previous unweighted methods, this wILS utilizes fewer markers to explain greater variance in composite scores.

"Serum sntf, a surrogate marker of axonal injury, rapidly predicts lasting brain dysfunction in mild TBI treated in the ER",Siman R.; Cui H.; Wewerka S.; Hamel L.; Smith D.; Zwank M. ,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, causes persisting post-concussion syndrome for many patients without abnormalities on conventional neuroimaging. Currently, there is no validated method for identifying at-risk cases at an early and potentially treatable stage. SNTF is a calpain-derived N-terminal proteolytic fragment of spectrin (alphaII-spectrin1-1176) generated under neurodegenerative conditions, including in damaged axons following mTBI. Preliminary human studies provide evidence that elevated blood SNTF on the day of mTBI correlates with white matter disruption and lasting brain dysfunction. Here, we conducted a larger study evaluating serum SNTF as a rapid prognostic marker for persisting brain dysfunction in CTnegative mTBI patients treated in an emergency department Level I trauma center setting. Compared with healthy controls (n = 40), serum SNTF increased by 92% within 24 hours of mTBI (n = 96; p < 0.0001), and as a diagnostic exhibited 100% specificity and 36% sensitivity (AUC = 0.87; p < 0.0001). To determine whether the subset of mTBI cases positive for SNTF preferentially developed lasting brain dysfunction, its serum levels on the day of mTBI were compared with multiple measures of brain performance at 30 and 90 days post-injury. Elevated serum SNTF correlated significantly in group analyses with impairments at 90 days in cognition under stress and sensory-motor integration, and predicted dysfunctional sensory-motor integration on a case by case basis (AUC = 0.76; p = 0.006). SNTF also predicted poorer recovery of cognitive stress function determined from the difference in 90 and 30 day performance (AUC = 0.79-0.90). These results indicate that serum SNTF, a surrogate marker for axonal injury after mTBI, has potential for the rapid prognosis of persisting postconcussion symptoms and impaired functional recovery following CT-negative mTBI, and provide further evidence linking diffuse axonal injury to chronic brain dysfunction. An SNTF blood test may have important utilities in the research, management and treatment of concussion.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A107,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628868618,#21106,Siman 2019,,yes
Extracellular vesicles as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of traumatic brain injury,Beard K.; Yang Z.; Haber M.; Sandsmark D.; Diaz-Arrastia R.; Meaney D.; Issadore D. ,"Objective: The objective of this study was to use protein cargo from GluR2+ extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for discriminating TBI patients from healthy controls and to predict patient outcome at 3 months. Method(s): Our lab has developed an innovative strategy for neurologic injury assessment that combines nanofluidic technologies to isolate EVs from patient plasma with downstream analysis of EV protein or nucleic acid cargo in a platform we call exoTENPO. By using biotinylated anti-GluR2 antibodies and anti-biotin magnetic nanoparticles we can selectively capture brain-derived EVs on our device. In the present study we used plasma from 23 controls and from 19 TBI patients enrolled in the TRACK-TBI study. We combined our exoTENPO technique with SIMOA digital ELISA for analysis of EVand plasma-associated expression of both conventional markers GFAP, Tau, NFL, and UCHL1 and of cytokines IL6, IL10, and TNFalpha. Result(s): Expression of these seven markers was highly variable across patients in both the plasma and GluR2+ EV compartments. Markers in the GluR2 compartment did not correlate with their counterparts in the plasma, suggesting the two provide orthogonal information for characterizing TBI. Combining conventional serological markers and GluR2+ EV-associated markers using machine learning yielded higher AUC for discriminating TBI from controls (AUC = 0.95) than the use of any one marker alone (AUC = 0.88). While the conventional serological markers GFAP, UCHL1, and NFL were most accurate for predicting TBI diagnosis, analysis of serological and GluR2+EV-associated cytokines yielded most accurate prediction of outcome at 3 months. Conclusion(s): We have used an innovative approach to begin addressing a major gap in neurological assessment that will aid clinicians in more accurately diagnosing TBI and predicting patient outcome that combines analysis of GluR2+ EVs with serological markers.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,13,A18-A19,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts,628868639,#21105,Beard 2019,,yes
How do CRASH and IMPACT compare to a machine learning-based prognostic model from Tanzania?,Elahi C.; Rocha T.; Fuller A.; Staton C.; Vissoci J.; Haglund M. ,"Introduction: Health facilities in low and middle income countries (LMICs) could benefit from decision support technologies to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). CRASH and IMPACT are robust examples of TBI prognostic models. Despite the strengths of these two models, advanced statistical techniques and improved data quality in LMICs provide an opportunity to develop more accurate, and context specific, prognostic models. We developed a machine learning-based prognostic model using a TBI registry from a hospital in Tanzania. In this study, we compare the performance of our model against CRASH and IMPACT. Method(s): We used the CRASH and IMPACT online risk calculators to generate risk scores for each patient in a TBI registry from a regional referral hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. We compared the discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]) and calibration (agreement between predicted and observed outcomes) for CRASH, IMPACT, and our model. We calculated the AUC using Youden's index and provided the 95% confidence interval (CI). The outcome of interest was unfavorable in-hospital outcome defined as a Glasgow outcome scale score of one, two or three. Result(s): We used a 3138 patient TBI registry for the three model comparison. There was an 11% observed unfavorable outcome rate. The AUC for our model, CRASH and IMPACT was 90.3 (CI: 88.6, 92.1), 85.8 (CI: 83.3, 88.3) and 82.0 (CI: 79.3, 84.7), respectively. The interquartile range for predicted risk scores were 10-36% (median = 16%) for our model, 5-14% (median = 5%) for CRASH, and 15-32% (median = 21%) for IMPACT. Conclusion(s): Our model had better discrimination and similar calibration compared to CRASH and IMPACT models.

Electrophysiological prognostication of functional cortical integrity after traumatic brain injury,Mofakham S.; Fry A.; Adachi J.; Winans N.; Ashcroft B.; Liang J.; Fiore S.; Sharma H.; Park I.; Mikell C. ,"Introduction: Whether and how consciousness returns after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not clear, mainly due to our lack of understanding of how consciousness arises. Previous studies revealed that correlated activity across a distributed network of cortical cells, the frontoparietal network (FPN), is required for return of consciousness. But data on the transition from coma to wakefulness are sparse. To address this gap, we performed depth electrode recordings of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) along with simultaneous scalp EEG recording in patients recovering from coma after TBI. We sought to extract predictive electrophysiological biomarkers of regaining consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Method(s): In this study one healthy control (epilepsy) and five comatose traumatic brain injury patients with GCS < 8 and with no major brain structural abnormalities were enrolled. Upon obtaining informed consent by a legally authorized representative, we implanted a seizure monitoring stereotactic (10-contact) depth electrode spanning from DLPFC to ACC. To probe the functional integrity of cortical webs we administered repetitive single-pulse stimulation to ACC and DLPFC (100 muS, 1 Hz stimulation, 100 reps). Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) were recorded both via the implanted depth electrode and scalp contacts. Result(s): We found that recovery of consciousness is associated with increasing amplitude and complexity of CCEPs in DLFPC. While all patients had increased amplitude over time, patients who recovered developed polyphasic, complex waveforms, as measured by zero crossing and permutation entropy (n = 5). The patients who did not recover (n = 2) had large-amplitude, but simple-waveform CCEP responses. Conclusion(s): The characteristics of the evoked responses to electrical stimulation may be a useful surrogate measurement of the integrity of cortical networks required for consciousness. CCEPs potentially be used as an indicator of integrity of cortex to predict outcome after TBI.",2019,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,131,1,33,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.7.JNS.AANS2019abstracts,628993237,#21096,Mofakham 2019,,yes
"Autoantibody production following Traumatic Brain Injury is associated with poor outcome, and is therapeutically modifiable",Needham E.; Coles A.; Menon D.K. ,"Background and aims: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Significant unexplained heterogeneity in outcome occurs, with prognostic models accounting for only around one third of variation. Differential immunological responses to TBI represent a potentially therapeutically modifiable factor. We hypothesise that a proportion of TBI patients develop autoantibodies to brain antigens, which associate with poor outcome. Method(s): We developed a protein microarray to detect autoantibodies against brain antigens in TBI patients at day 0, day 7 and 6-9 months post-injury, and compared immunological responses with clinical outcome. Result(s): The development of IgM or IgG autoantibodies was seen in around two-thirds of patients by day 7, and a similar proportion demonstrated persisting IgG autoantibodies at 6-9 months. There was marked interindividual variation, with a distinct subset demonstrating a tendency to autoimmunity. The presence of IgM and IgG autoantibodies added significant prognostic predictive value when combined in a multivariable regression model with the IMPACT prognostic score, increasing R2 against GOSE from 0.14 to 0.404 (p=0.02). IgG responses appear to be driven largely by magnitude of protein release (GFAP autoantibody vs GFAP protein: R2=0.464, p=0.001). IgG responses are markedly attenuated by recombinant IL1RA treatment (mean IgG hits 0.1 vs 0.6; p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Autoantibodies to brain antigens develop after TBI in a subset of patients and appear to independently correlate with poor outcome. Their development can be arrested by IL1RA, raising the possibility that autoimmunity represents a therapeutically modifiable aspect of secondary injury in TBI.",2019,/,European Journal of Neurology,26,Supplement 1,27,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.14017,629003837,#21089,Needham 2019,,yes
Exosome proteins as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury,Flamholz M.; Beard K.; Haber M.; Yang Z.; Ko J.; Silverman E.; Meredith-Duliba T.; Kulkarni N.; Sandsmark D.; Meaney D.; Issadore D.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Objective: Investigate cytokines and neurodegenerative proteins in whole plasma and neuronderived exosomes as biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI). Background(s): Blood-circulating exosomes have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for various diseases, such as HIV and certain malignancies. This study investigated the utility of measuring TBI-associated proteins in neuron-derived exosomes as potential biomarkers for TBI. Design/Methods: Blood samples were collected from 17 subjects (10 TBI, 7 control) within 24 hours of injury and assayed for concentrations of 7 TBI-relevant proteins (cytokinesinterleukins 6 and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alphaalpha); neurodegeneration-associated - neurofilament light chain (NFL), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL-1), Tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) using the SIMOA immunoassay (Quanterix, Inc.) The concentration of each protein was measured in whole plasma, total exosomes, and glutamate receptor - 2 (GLU-R2)- containing exosomes. These values were analyzed along with the pertinent clinical information to determine their diagnostic and prognostic potential. Result(s): Within total plasma, NFL and GFAP levels were significantly increased in TBI subjects as compared to controls (p < 0.05). Differences in protein and cytokine content were observed between whole plasma and exosomes as well. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from logistic regression models. GluR2-exosome and whole plasma proteins showed modest to excellent predictive power of TBI vs. control subjects (AUC=0.71-0.93). A machine learning algorithm improved the diagnostic model's AUC above 0.9. When all neurodegenerative proteins were combined in a logistic regression model for prediction of 3- month outcome ('good recovery' = GOSE score of 7-8), the GLU-R2 exosome protein content (AUC=0.93) performed better than whole plasma content (AUC=0.86). Conclusion(s): This study showed cytokine and neurodegenerative protein concentrations differ within whole plasma, total exosome, and Glu-R2 exosomes. The data also indicate modest to excellent diagnostic and prognostic power for these proteins suggesting potential for Glu-R2 exosome proteins as biomarkers for TBI.",2019,/,Neurology,92,15 Supplement 1,,,,629259917,#21073,Flamholz 2019,,yes
Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter with Intracranial Hypertension in Patients with Traumatic Head Injury,Al-Hassani A.; El-Menyar A.; Al-Thani H. ,"Introduction: We aimed to study the relationship between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Method(s): A single-center retrospective cohort study of traumatic brain injury patients was conducted between 2010 and 2014. Data were analyzed and compared according to ICP monitoring and values. Outcomes included intracranial hypertension (ICH) and in-hospital mortality. Result(s): We identified 167 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 33 +/- 14 years; of these, 96 had ICP monitored. In comparison with ICP monitored, the non-ICP group were older and had lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, higher head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores, and more midline shift on CT scans (p < 0.05). In patients with ICP monitoring, non-survivors were 4 years older and had higher mean ICP (p = 0.04) compared with survivors. The ICP values correlated with ONSD measurement (r = 0.21, p = 0.04). Patients with ICH were more likely to have higher mean ONSD (p = 0.01) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.004). Receiver operating curve for ONSD showed a cutoff value of 5.6 mm to detect ICH, with sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 50%. Age and ICP were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate model. Another model with the same covariates showed ONSD and subarachnoid hemorrhage to be independent predictors of ICH. Simple linear regression showed a significant association of ONSD with increased ICP (beta = 0.21; 95% CI 0.25 to 5.08; p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Optic nerve sheath diameter is a simple non-invasive measurement in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury that has prognostic implications for ICH. However, additional prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2019",2019,/,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,229,4 Supplement 1,S191,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2019.08.421,2002922967,#21064,Al-Hassani 2019,,yes
"Serum lactate, base deficit, and glucose levels as prognostic markers in severe traumatic brain injury",Shukla R.; Mahajan C.; Goyal K.; Chaturvedi A. ,"Background: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that high lactate levels, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia are associated with increased mortality and poor outcome in terms of Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) among the patients who have sustained severe TBI (GCS < 8). Material(s) and Method(s): This was a prospective, observational study conducted from April 2018 to April 2019 in a 20-bedded neuro-trauma ICU of tertiary care hospital in North India. Patients aged 18 to 60 years with severe TBI reporting within 48 hours of the event were included. The primary objective was to study the association of initial serum lactate with the outcome at 30 days and secondary objective was to study association of initial base deficit and initial serum glucose levels with the outcome at 30 days, in severe TBI patients. The neurological outcome of patients was assessed as the GOS-E. A single measurement of serum lactate, base deficit and serum glucose from the patient at the time of admission was recorded. Result(s): A total of 87 patients (males:females = 5.7:1) were included in the study. Mean (SD) age of patients was 35 (13) years. Both serum lactate ( > 4 mmol/L) and serum glucose ( > 180 mg/dL) were found to be associated with unfavorable outcome (GOS-E < 4) with P<0.01. Association between base deficit (< 4) and GOSE-E was not found to be statistically significant (P = 0.8). At 30th day, 56/87 (64.4%) patients had died.

Mental recovery in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Zaitsev O.; Maksakova O.; Potapov A. ,"Introduction: Recovery of mental activity after coma is one of the most important goals of rehabilitation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Aim(s): To reveal clinical, pathogenetic, prognostic and rehabilitation patterns of mental recovery in patients with sTBI. Material(s) and Method(s): 163 patients with sTBI were studied. All patients were examined clinically with a total registration of psychopathological symptoms from the acute phase to follow-up. Result(s): All of revealed clinical symptoms were divided to: 1) signs of deficiency, 2) preserved or recovered functions, 3) additional productive disturbances, including agi- tation, automatisms, false judgments, illusions, hallucinations, and affective disorders. Changes in hemispheric interaction and cerebral neurotransmitter landscape appeared to be the most important in pathogenesis and sanogenesis of brain damage. The prognosis of mental recovery after sTBI was dependent on many factors, primarily on level of brain damage, presence of arterial hypotension and hypoxia in the acute period of injury, secondary effects as hydrocephalus and atrophy of brain tissue. The revealed multivariate determined the need for broad spectrum not standard but optional treatment and rehabilitation based on the individual choices of drug therapy (neurometabolic, anticonvulsant, neuroleptic, antidepressant, anxiolytic), parameters of brain stimulation, psychotherapeutic interventions, social work.

Prognostic value of Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test,Wilkins K.J.; Haider M.N.; Wilber C.G.; Viera K.B.; Leddy J.J. ,"Purpose: Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) identifies the heart rate (HR) threshold (HRt) of exercise tolerance in concussed patients and is dependent on the severity of concussion. We hypothesize that difference between resting HR and HRt (DHR) would be negatively correlated with recovery time. Method(s): Acutely concussed (AC, < 10 days) patients were diagnosed with concussions and performed the BCTT the same day. ?HR was calculated. AC reported symptoms online daily and were seen by physician weekly until recovered. Pearson correlation was calculated between ? HR and recovery time, x2 test was used to assess the association of DHR and post-concussion syndrome (PCS, recovery . 30 days). Result(s): Mean HRt for AC (n = 102, 15 +/- 1.7 years, 53% male, 5 +/- 2 days since injury) was 139 +/- 24 bpm. Mean resting HR was 75 +/- 13 bpm. Mean DHR was 62 +/- 24 bpm and mean recovery time was 18.4 +/- 13 days. DHR was negatively correlated with recovery time (r = 20.29, P = 0.003). DHR was significantly lower in patients who developed PCS (n = 9, DHR = 41 +/- 20) when compared with those who did not (n = 93, DHR = 64 +/- 23, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): Data from this study suggests that DHR obtained from the BCTT performed within 10 days of injury is negatively correlated with recovery time and low DHR (;40 bpm) may predict PCS. Significance: The results from the BCTT have prognostic value in evaluating recovery time, and predicting PCS.

Comparative analysis for the implication of serum cardiac troponin measurements by conventional versus high-sensitivity assays in patients with traumatic brain injury,El-Menyar A.; Al-Thani H. ,"Background: Stress-induced myocardial injury is not well-studied in patients with head injury. Objective(s): To assess the prognostic implication of positive (+ve) Troponins (Tn) measurements by conventional (CTn) versus High-Sensitivity (HsTnT) assay in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): A retrospective analysis was conducted for patients who were admitted with TBI between 2010 and 2014. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, troponin assay results, TBI lesions, and hospital outcomes were analyzed and compared based on troponin assay (CTn versus HsTnT). Result(s): Across the study period, 946 patients withTBI were admitted; of them 654 had troponin levels measured within 24 h post-injury (CTn=252 and HsTnT=402). The mean age was 31 years and 46% had positive tro-ponins. There were 147 deaths (22.5%); of them 54% had +ve HsTnT, 23% had +ve CTn, 16% had -ve CTn and 7% had -ve HsTnT). When the troponin was tested <=4h post-injury, the mortality was 10.2% in patients with -ve CTn and 4% in patients with -ve HsTnT. There was no documented obvious direct cardiac injury. Overall, patients with positive troponins had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), higher Injury Severity Scores and higher rates of brain edema (p=0.001), pneumonia and sepsis (p=0.001) than those with negative troponin results. In two different models, multivariate regression analysis showed that +ve CTn and +ve HsTnT were independent predictors of mortality (OR 3.94, 95% CI: 1.65-9.42) and (OR 3.39; 95% CI 1.39-8.36); respectively, after adjusting for age, injury severity scores, GCS, TBI type, neurosurgical intervention, sepsis, and chest injury. Conclusion(s): Stress-induced myocyte injury is high in TBI. Positive serum troponins, irrespective of the assay type, are associated with poor outcomes post-TBI. Positive HsTnT could be used for early risk stratification and prognosis in brain injury.

Early outcome predictors of traumatic brain injury,Dlela M.; Triki A.; Turki O.; Bradaii S.; Bahloul M.; Hamida C.B.; Bouaziz M. ,"Introduction: Brain-injury is a leading factor of mortality and morbidity from traumatic injury in young and previously healthy patients. Early evaluation of the prognosis of a patient is necessary to determine the most suitable medical care strategy. The aim of this study was to predict mortality and outcome in brain injured population based on the first clinical and biological evaluation. Patients and Methods: We conducted an eight month long prospective cohort, including all patients admitted to a university hospital ICU with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), defined as a Glasgow coma scale below twelve (GCS < 12). Outcome was evaluated by incidence of death, and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) on day thirty. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine level of significance. Result(s): During the study period, 118 trauma patients were admitted to our ICU, 83presented with moderate to severe TBI and were included. There were 69 males (83.1%) and 14 females (16.9%) patients. The mean age was at 32.06 +/- 18.07 and mean injury severity score (ISS) was 28.96 +/- 10.16. According to our analysis mortality rate among patients sustaining moderate to severe TBI was 15.7%. Average ICU LOS was 14.6 days and average ventilator days was 9.68 days. Using the multivariable logistic regression model, only initial glucose serum levels (p = 0.002) and pupil response (p- 0.004) were found to be independent risk factors of mortality. Linear regression models also identified glucose levels as predictive of GOS on day 30 (p = 0.019). Conclusion(s): We conclude that initial glucose level is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity in brain injured patients. Hyperglycemia could be considered as a simple yet valuable marker ofbrain injury and, when present upon admission, could reflect extensivebrain damage, frequently associated with mortality and bad outcome.",2019,/,Annals of Intensive Care,9,Supplement 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-018-0474-7,630113692,#21006,Dlela 2019,,yes
Prognostic impact of early hyponatremia in patients with severe brain injury,Turki O.; Triki A.; Hela K.; Yousfi M.; Sabrine B.; Dlela M.; Bouchala K.; Hedi C.; Mabrouk B.; Bouaziz M. ,"Introduction: Hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium < 135 mEq L) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is also an independent predictor of poor neurologic outcome. We encounter hyponatremia frequently in our practice, and we therefore decided to review data from our center to estimate the incidence of hyponatremia, to analyse the incidence and the impact outcame in patient admitted with TBI in our intensive care unit. Patients and Methods: It is a retrospective study conducted over a period of 4 years (from January 2009 to December 2012) in a polyvalent reanimation setting with 22 beds. All patients with postraumatic head injury who developed hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L) during the first 36 h of their stay were included. The hyponatremia was devided into mild (130 <= Na + < 135), moderate (125 <= Na + < 130) and severe hyponatremia (Na + < 125). Epidemiological, clinical and evolutionary data were collected and a descriptive and analytical statistical study was conducted. Result(s): Two hundred and twenty one patients were included. All of them came from a road accident with an average age of 31.8 years. The male sex was predominant with a percentage of 84%. Eighty seven percent of patients presented mild hyponatremia whereas 12% had a moderate hyponatremia and only 1% developed a severe hyponatremia. The 25 patients with moderate hyponatremia experienced longer ventilator-free days (24 vs 16 +p=0.32), longer intensive care unit stays (22 vs 28 +p=0.15), and less favorable outcomes compared to the 193 patients who have mild hyponatremia + however, these differences were not significant. Conclusion(s): Our study showed an elevated frequency of hyponatremia in patients with brain injuries in ICU which demands the effective approaches for an accurate and timely diagnosis of this electrolyte disorder.

The clinical outcomes depend on cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) impairments which can also be affected by patients' age, brain injury grade or pharmacological influences. Here we compare the effectiveness of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) targeted therapy in younger (<45 years-old) and elderly (>=45 years-old) TBI patients. Multimodal invasive ABP(t), ICP(t), CPP(t), and CPPopt(t) monitoring was performed on 81 severe TBI patients in Republic Vilnius University Hospital (Lithuania). ICM+ software was used for continuous CPPopt(t) assessment by identification of Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx(t)). The analysis of associations between the patients' outcome and complex of monitored physiological parameters was performed by creating multifactorial model of TBI patient's outcome prediction. The most significant prognostic factors were age, GCS, serum glucose, Helsinki CT score and duration of Longest CA Impairment event (LCAI) when PRx(t) > 0.5 within 24 h after admission. The modeled accuracies for mortality and unfavorable outcome prediction were 82% and 86%, respectively. Age > 45 years was associated with unfavorable outcome. CPP values close to CPPopt were associated with a better outcome in younger patients. Mean DELTACPPopt < -5.0 mmHg, mean PRx > 0.36, and LCAI > 100 min were significantly associated with mortality for the younger patients. The critical values of averaged PRx > 0.26 and LCAI > 61 min were significantly associated with mortality for the elderly group.

Long term prognosis of severe traumatic brain injured patients using acute phase neurophysiology testing,Bauer J.S.; Panczykowski D.M.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.O.; Balzer J.; Choi P.; Zusman B. ,"INTRODUCTION: Prognostic models for severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) include initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupillary response, and computerized tomography results in their computations; however, their predictive value is limited by confounding variables contributing to outcome and poor inter-rater reliability. Use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) testing in the acute phase may provide additional objective data to improve prognostication in sTBI. METHOD(S): Under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol, prospective clinical and outcome data were collected from all severe TBI patients (GCS = 8) admitted to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital over a 5-yr period. SSEPs were obtained on post-trauma day 5 in patients who were not following commands. N9, N13, P14, N20, and P30 latencies are measured; central conduction time was defined as the delay between the P14 peak recorded at the C-2 electrode and the N20 peak recorded at the somatosensory cortex. Peak-to-peak amplitudes measured were of N20/P30 using Fz reference. Criterion for pathologic SSEP event was defined as either the reduction of the N20 amplitude below 50% of baseline or the in-crease of latency between P14 and N20 by 10%. SSEPs were graded as bilaterally absent, unilateral absence, bilateral delay > 23 ms, unilateral delay with normal, and bilateral normal latency. Functional outcome was prospectively collected at 12-mo follow-up, and included mortality and neurologic status as assessed by GOS. RESULT(S): A total of 145 patients were available for analysis. Median GCS was 6 (IQR 2), while median radiographic injury was a Marshall score 3 (IQR 2). Mean age was 38 +/- 16 yr. Univariable ordinal logistic regression analysis of SSEP demonstrated significant ordinal prediction of outcome according to GOS; favorable outcome correlated with higher SSEP grading [OR = 1.66, 95% CI (1.29-2.13), P = .001].

Predicting recovery after mild TBI,Booker J. ,"INTRODUCTION: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) is often treated as a homogenous group in current practice. Stratifying patients more accurately may result in the implementation of more effective, individualized treatment.We aimed to identify prognostic indicators of recovery 1-yr following MTBI. METHOD(S): Using a prospective, observational study design, a large MTBI population (N = 596) was recruited following admission to the Emergency Department. Data was collected at brain injury clinics between August 2011 and July 2015. Functional recovery at 1-yr was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). RESULT(S): A follow-up rate of 92% was achieved. The most common aetiologies of MTBI were falls (n = 222) and road traffic collisions (n = 154). Distribution of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15 (n = 363), 14 (n = 156) and 13 (n = 77). Multiordinal logistic regression of the GOSE found that psychiatric history (P < .001), alcohol intoxication (P = .011), assault (P = .022) and GCS <15 (P = < .001), led to worse outcome. An abnormal CT scan was not a predictor of functional recovery. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings indicate that after MTBI, patients with previous psychiatric history, GCS <15, aetiology of assault and alcohol intoxication result in worse long-term outcomes.

Defining coagulopathy by Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in patients with traumatic brain injury,Lazoudi E.; Iasonidou C.; Siomos E.; Kosmas A.; Seitsidou E.; Kapravelos N. ,"INTRODUCTION. Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often accompanied by coagulopathy and its presence has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor. Rapid assessment of coagulation status and successful treatment of bleeding disorders are crucial. Standard coagulation tests are usually time consuming and provide information only on the initiation of clot formation. In contrast, thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assess coagulation status within minutes and offer information on clot firmness and clot stability, as well as the initiation of coagulation. OBJECTIVES. This retrospective study was designed to assess the potential role of ROTEM in patients (pts) with TBI, to identify associated coagulopathy and to correlate these hemostatic disorders with outcome. METHODS. This retrospective evaluation comprised ICU pts with TBI. Blood samples were obtained on admission, after 12 and after 24-48 hours. ROTEM analysis (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM tests) and standard laboratory coagulation tests ( PT, INR, aPTT, platelets count, fibrinogen concentration) were compared. The hemostatic parameters were compared between survivors and non survivors. We evaluated the time course of hemostatic disorders and their relationship with the expansion of hemorrhage, as confirmed by CT-scan. Using standard laboratory tests coagulopathy was defined as one or more of following: INR>1.5, aPTT>35s, fibrinogen<150mg/dL, PLT<100000/muL. Using ROTEM coagulopathy was defined as one or more of the following results: CTextem>80s, CFTextem>159s, MCFextem<50mm, CTintem> 240s, CFTintem>110s, MCFintem<50mm, A10fibtem<7mm. RESULTS. 29 pts with TBI aged 48.31 years were evaluated. 23 pts survived (79.3%) and 6 (20.6%) died. Coagulopathy as defined by both tests were observed in 10 pts (34.48%). In this group 7 pts survived (70%) and 3 (30%) died, while 8 developed expansion of hemorrhage on CT-scan (80%). Out of 29 pts in 19 (65.5%) were observed abnormalities in ROTEM variables, while 9(47.36%) pts of them revealed normal standard coagulation tests. In this group 15 (78.9%) pts survived and 3 died. Remarkably, 16 pts with abnormal ROTEM analysis developed expansion of hemorrhage and 3 did not, which difference is statistically significant (p<0.05). Also we observed abnormal CTextem in 18 (62%), CTintem in 8 (27.5%) and A10fibtem in 7 (24.1%). Abnormalities in ROTEM were observed in 15pts (51.7%) on admission, in 13pts (44.8%) after 12h and in 15pts (51.7%) after 24-48h. CONCLUSION. Coagulopathy is a frequently encountered and highly morbid complication of TBI that has been consistently linked to poor outcomes. ROTEM provides rapid and useful information on the coagulation status of pts with TBI. ROTEM appeared to offer an early signal of life-threatening TBI.

Identification of prognostic factors to facilitate reduction of ICU overtriage in elderly patients with isolated mild traumatic brain injury,Jacome T.; Cage K.; Van Nguyen H.; Tatum D. ,"Introduction Elderly patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are frequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), which is potentially both harmful and unnecessary. However, little exists to inform early decision making to determine appropriate utilization of ICU care. Here we sought to elucidate factors available upon admission to identify geriatric patients who could safely be monitored in a non-ICU setting. Methods Adults 65+ years admitted with isolated mTBI, defined as positive radiologic study and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13-15, between January 2011-December 2016 were identified. Primary outcomes were overtriage (defined as hospital stay <= 2 days, ICU <= 1 overnight stay, no surgery, no intubation, and discharged home) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Positive outcome was defined as GOS 4-5 and poor outcome as GOS>= 3. Results A total of 234 patients met criteria. Of these, 27 underwent emergent neurosurgical intervention., leaving 207 for analysis. Most presented with GCS 15 (77.8%) and were admitted to ICU (85.5%). Nearly 27% (n = 55) met overtriage criteria. Hemorrhage progression developed in 8.7%, and 21.7% had >=2 point decrease in GCS during hospital stay. Upon discharge, 89.9% were classified GOS 4-5. Predictors of positive outcome included: lower age (p = 0.001), admit GCS 15 (p = 0.039), >=2 comorbidities (p = 0.007), and no home use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication (p = 0.007). Presence/type of a single intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was not significantly associated with outcome, but presence of bilateral or multiple lesions independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.040). Conclusions Overtriage of patients to an ICU is costly, resource intensive, and avoidable. Here, we suggest a conservative framework to assist the determination of which patients can be safely observed in non-ICU setting. Future studies should determine if this framework is generalizable to the entire geriatric population who present with mTBI.",2019,/,Neurocritical Care,31,1 Supplement,S232,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-019-00857-7,631884803,#20914,Jacome 2019,,yes
Comparison between marshall and rotterdam ct scores in predicting outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury: A retrospective cohort study from lower-middle income country,Zairinal R.A.; Rose B.; Yunus R.E. ,"Introduction Early prognostication, either from clinical and/or radiological information, is an important aspect in the settings of neurocritical care with limited resources. We sought to determine the values of two radiological scoring systems in predicting the outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, which are Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores in Indonesia. Therefore, a physician can make a better priority to provide high-yield care to all TBI patients. Methods A retrospective cohort was conducted in a national referral hospital from July to December 2017. All TBI patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) and had an initial CT scan were included in this study. Their classification of TBI and initial CT scan were reviewed and all patients were followed to see whether the patient died or alive until discharge from the hospital (in-hospital mortality). Statistical analyses were conducted to find the predictive values (sensitivity, specificity, cut-off point, relative risk) of both scoring systems. Results Of 141 TBI patients admitted to ED, there were 136 patients had an initial CT scan. Most of them were categorized as mild TBI (80.9%), then moderate (14.0%) and severe TBI (5.1%). In-hospital mortality was 9.6%. With cut-off point 1 in Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores, their sensitivity (92.3% vs. 92.3%, respectively) and specificity (73.1% vs. 74.8%, respectively) were similar. Same things also found in their relative risks, which are 24.267 (95% CI 3.256-180.835) and 25.953 (95% CI 3.485-193.258). Conclusions Both Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores have significant values in predicting the outcome of TBI patients, thus it should be implemented in daily emergency practice to assist a physician in making further clinical decisions.",2019,/,Neurocritical Care,31,1 Supplement,S173,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-019-00857-7,631884881,#20912,Zairinal 2019,,yes
Hypochloremia in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Possible Risk Factor for Increased Mortality,Rodriguez-Trivino C.Y.; Torres Castro I.; Duenas Z. ,"Objective: To determine association between electrolyte disturbances and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Method(s): Medical records of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale score <8 and electrolyte alterations were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study. Electrolyte levels were analyzed to establish an association between patients who died and patients who survived. Bivariate analysis was performed using chi2 test with a statistical reliability of 95% for categorical variables. Analysis for electrolyte changes to determine association with mortality was performed using chi2 test with multiple comparisons. Logistic regression was performed between the electrolyte alterations and their association with mortality. The reliability of statistical tests was 95%. Result(s): There was a significant relationship between hypochloremia and increased risk of mortality in 23.1% of deceased patients (P = 0.03). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation with age (P < 0.01) and with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II (P < 0.01).

Prognostic Value of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Predicting the 6-Month Outcome of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Study,Zhao J.-L.; Du Z.-Y.; Yuan Q.; Yu J.; Sun Y.-R.; Wu X.; Li Z.-Q.; Wu X.-H.; Hu J. ,"Background: Peripheral white blood cells are regularly analyzed on admission for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting the 6-month outcome of patients with TBI is unclear. Method(s): We designed a single-center retrospective cohort study. Patients admitted to Fudan University Huashan Hospital within 6 hours after TBI were identified between December 2004 and December 2017. The primary outcome was 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Independent predictors of 6-month outcome were assessed using uni- and multivariate analyses. Three models based on admission characteristics were built to evaluate the prognostic value of the NLR in predicting the outcome of patients with TBI. The discriminative ability of predictive models was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): A total of 1291 patients with TBI were included. Multivariate analysis showed age, Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission, subdural hematoma, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, NLR (P < 0.001), and coagulopathy (P = 0.028) were independent predictors of 6-month outcome. The model combining the NLR and standard variables (AUC = 0.936; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.923-0.949) was more favorable in predicting 6-month outcome of patients with TBI than the model without the NLR (AUC = 0.901; 95% CI, 0.883-0.919) and the model based only on the NLR (AUC = 0.827; 95% CI, 0.802-0.852). Conclusion(s): NLR is an independent prognostic factor of predicting 6-month outcome of patients with TBI. A high NLR in patients with TBI is associated with poor outcome.

Significance of cardiac troponin i elevation in traumatic brain injury patients,Ashraf A.; Marzban S.; Haghighi M.; Ziabari S.M.Z.; Biazar G.; Rimaz S.; Omidi S. ,"Background: Myocardial dysfunction is frequently described as an underlying cause of mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) known as brain-cardiac link. However the impact on prognosis of a disease remains uncertain. Objective(s): The current study aimed at investigating the correlation between TBI and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) rise and in-hospital mortality rate among patients with TBI. Method(s): In the current prospective study TBI patients with abbreviated injury scale score (AIS) > 3 and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score<=8 with cTnI measurement within the first 24 hours of admission were evaluated. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Logistic Regression tests were used for data analysis. Result(s): A total of 166 eligible patients were studied.The mean age of the cases was 37.64+/-17.21 years, largely under 65 (93.4%) and male (86.7%).The most common injuries were cerebral contusion (35.1%), while motor vehicle crash (MVC) was the most common cause of injuries (83.73%); 59 % of the patients showed detectable cTnI concentrations within 24 hours of admission; 65.7% of the patients expired; they showed higher levels of cTnI compared to survivors that showed lower levels, 0.148+/-0.074 vs 0.057+/-0.055, respectively (P < 0.001). Moreover, a significant association was observed between mortality rate and lower admission GCS 3.49+/- 1.08 vs 6.79+/-1.66, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Increased cTnI levels could be a predictor of mortality among patients with TBI.

"Prognosis of six-month glasgow outcome scale in severe traumatic brain injury using hospital admission characteristics, injury severity characteristics, and physiological monitoring during the first day post-injury",Rubin M.L.; Yamal J.-M.; Chan W.; Robertson C.S. ,"Gold standard prognostic models for long-term outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) use admission characteristics and are considered useful in some areas but not for clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to build prognostic models for 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) in patients with severe TBI, combining baseline characteristics with physiological, treatment, and injury severity data collected during the first 24 h after injury. We used a training dataset of 472 TBI subjects and several data mining algorithms to predict the long-term neurological outcome. Performance of these algorithms was assessed in an independent (test) sample of 158 subjects. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) led to the highest prediction accuracy (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.86) in the test set. The most important post-baseline predictor of GOS was the best motor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) recorded in the first day post-injury. The LASSO model containing the best motor GCS and baseline variables as predictors outperformed a model with baseline data only. TBI patient physiology of the first day-post-injury did not have a major contribution to patient prognosis six months after injury. In conclusion, 6-month GOS in patients with TBI can be predicted with good accuracy by the end of the first day post-injury, using hospital admission data and information on the best motor GCS achieved during those first 24 h post-injury. Passed the first day after injury, important physiological predictors could emerge from landmark analyses, leading to prediction models of higher accuracy than the one proposed in the current research.© Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,16,2417-2422,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6217,628806137,#20788,Rubin 2019,,yes
Modeling the Influence of Age on Neurological Outcome and Quality of Life One Year after Traumatic Brain Injury: A Prospective Multi-Center Cohort Study,Bouzat P.; Ageron F.-X.; Thomas M.; Vallot C.; Hautefeuille S.; Schilte C.; Payen J.-F. ,"After traumatic brain injury (TBI), the relationship between age and outcome at 1 year, including quality of life, has been poorly explored. The aim of our study was to describe this relationship in a cohort of TBI patients in a regional trauma system. Consecutive TBI patients with severe lesions on initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan were included from July 2014 to July 2016 in two French level-1 trauma centers. The primary outcome was the mortality at 1 year and secondary outcomes were Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) and quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The relationship between age and outcome was modeled using the generalized linear model (GLM). Within the study period, 427 patients with TBI and type 3 Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) lesions were included. Finally, 380 patients were assessed for mortality. Ninety-six (25%) patients died at 1 year. The detailed neurological status was available for 317 patients. One year after the trauma, 141 (44%) patients had a favorable outcome (GOS-E 7 and 8), whereas 53 (17%) patients had a moderate disability (GOS-E 5-6), 27 (9%) patients had a severe disability or were in a vegetative state (GOS-E 2-4), and 96 (30%) patients had died (GOS-E 1). After 70 years of age, a dramatic increase in the odds of death and poor neurological outcome was found using GLM. No difference according to age was found for the quality of life. After TBI, the mortality at 1 year dramatically increased with age after 70 years. For elderly survivors, impairment of quality of life was not different from younger patients.© Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",2019,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,36,17,2506-2512,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6432,629232882,#20763,Bouzat 2019,,yes
Role of Anthropometric Nutritional Assessment in Severe Head Injury,Dhandapani M.; Dhandapani S.; Agarwal M.; Chutani A.; Sharma B.S.; Mahapatra A.K. ,"Aim Nutritional demand after traumatic brain injury is increased due to hypermetabolic response. The present study was undertaken to assess nutritional status with anthropometric indices, factors associated, and their prognostic role following severe head injury (SHI). Method A total of 114 patients in age group 20 to 60 years, admitted within 24 hours of SHI, with Glasgow Coma Scale of 4 to 8, and with no serious systemic disorder were enrolled for the study. Of these, 67 were prospectively assessed weekly till 21 days for changes in mid arm circumference (MAC), mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC), and triceps skin fold thickness (TSF). They were studied in relation to other factors and outcome was assessed at 3 months. Results The percentage fall at 3 weeks for MAC, MAMC, and TSF were 14, 10, and 37%, respectively. The percentage of fall in MAMC was the earliest, and was significantly greater in patients with surgical intervention, tracheostomy, prolonged fever, delayed enteral feeding, and greater caloric deficit. Admission MAMC < 90% of standard was significantly associated with unfavorable outcome (odds ratio 5.9 [95% confidence interval 1.3-27.8], p = 0.01). Unfavorable outcome was significantly more frequent in patients who had at least 15% fall in MAC (85.7 vs. 41.9%, p = 0.03), or 10% fall in MAMC (68.8 vs. 38.2%, p = 0.04) at 2 weeks, compared with others. Fall in TSF had no significant association with outcome at 3 months. In multivariate analysis, MAMC fall had significant independent association with unfavorable outcome. Conclusion Bedside anthropometry (especially MAMC) is efficient in identifying patients with nutrition depletion with significant influence on outcome at 3 months.Copyright © 2019 Neurotrauma Society of India.",2019,/,Indian Journal of Neurotrauma,16,1,21-26,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1698718,629686245,#20723,Dhandapani 2019,,yes
The Prognosis of Axial vs. Extra-Axial Lesions on Functional Status After Traumatic Brain Injury,Quach N.; Do J.; Dirlikov B.; Ehsanian R.; Pasipanodya E.C.; Ali A.; Duong T. ,"Background: Head computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used in acute head injury for medical triage and surgical decisions, yet there are contradictions on the prognostic value of different head CT classifications. The intra-axial (axial) lesion vs. extra-axial lesion is a well-known systemic classification but has not been applied into clinical practice since there is no evidence-based support for its prognostic value. Hypothesis: Axial injury is related to worse functional independence compared to extra-axial injury at admission to and discharge from acute rehabilitation hospitalization. Design(s): Observational retrospective study. Settings and participants: Data from 71 participants who were enrolled at an acute rehabilitation hospital in the Northern California Traumatic Brain Injury Model System of Care (NCTBIMS) between 2005 and 2018 were included in the analysis. Main outcome measure and statistical analysis: Results of non-contrast head CT within the first 7 days after injury were analyzed to determine those with axial vs. extra-axial lesions. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) total scores were compared between the axial vs. extra-axial groups at admission and discharge using parametric and non-parametric tests. Result(s): There were no statistically significant group differences in FIM total scores at rehabilitation admission and discharge between the axial group and extra-axial groups. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of patients there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that axial injury is related to worse functional independence compared to extra-axial injury at rehabilitation admission and discharge. Utilizing MRI findings or other outcome measures, such as the 10 meter ambulation test or cognitive tests, may provide better sensitivity to potential functional differences.© Copyright © 2019 Quach, Do, Dirlikov, Ehsanian, Pasipanodya, Ali and Duong.",2019,/,Frontiers in Neurology,10,"(Quach, Do, Dirlikov, Ehsanian, Pasipanodya, Ali) Rehabilitation Research Center, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, San Jose, CA, United States(Quach) Beaumont Hospital-Trenton, Trenton, MI, United States(Ehsanian) Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford Un",1167,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.01167,629849244,#20691,Quach 2019,,yes

Associations between pre-injury comorbidities and outcomes are not well-understood, and understanding their status as risk factors may improve mTBI management and prognostication. Method(s): mTBI subjects (GCS 13-15) from TRACK-TBI Pilot completing 3- and 6-month functional [Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)] and post-concussive outcomes [Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) physical/cognitive/sleep/emotional subdomains] were extracted. Pre-injury comorbidities >10% incidence were included in regressions for functional disability (GOSE <= 6) and post-concussive symptoms by subdomain. Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (B) were reported. Significance was assessed at p < 0.0083 (Bonferroni correction). Result(s): In 260 subjects sustaining blunt mTBI, mean age was 44.0-years and 70.4% were male. Baseline comorbidities >10% incidence included psychiatric-30.0%, cardiac (hypertension)-23.8%, cardiac (structural/valvular/ischemic)-20.4%, gastrointestinal-15.8%, pulmonary-15.0%, and headache/migraine-11.5%.

At 6-months, psychiatric (GOSE <= 6: OR = 2.57 [1.38-4.77]; ACE-physical: B = 1.38 [0.68-2.09]; ACE-cognitive: B = 0.74 [0.28-1.20]; ACE-sleep: B = 0.51 [0.20-0.83]; ACE-emotional: B = 0.93 [0.53-1.33]), and headache/migraine history (ACE-physical: B = 1.81 [0.79-2.84]) predicted worse outcomes. Conclusion(s): Pre-injury psychiatric and pre-injury headache/migraine symptoms are risk factors for worse functional and post-concussive outcomes at 3- and 6-months post-mTBI. mTBI patients presenting to acute care should be evaluated for psychiatric and headache/migraine history, with lower thresholds for providing TBI education/resources, surveillance, and follow-up/referrals.Copyright © 2019 Yue, Cnossen, Winkler, Deng, Phelps, Coss, Sharma, Robinson, Suen, Vassar, Schnyer, Puccio, Gardner, Yuh, Mukherjee, Valadka, Okonkwo, Lingsma, Manley and TRACK-TBI Investigators.

Our objective was to develop a new multidomain, comprehensive, sensitive, objective and easily reproducible outcome scale with high predictive accuracy to assess patients with traumatic brain injury. The developed outcome assessment tool, the Lagos Brain Disability Examination Scale was then tested for any association of outcome predictability with patients' admission modified Marshall, Rotterdam and Helsinki computerized tomographic scores. Method(s): A prospective cohort study was carried out of patients aged 16 years and above who sustained traumatic brain injury. All recruited patients had their biodata and derived cranial computerized tomographic scores documented using the modified Marshall, Rotterdam and Helsinki computerized tomographic scale on a pro forma. Outcomes were assessed at eight weeks after traumatic brain injury with the Lagos Brain Disability Examination Scale. Statistical significance was judged at p < 0.05 level. Result(s): Forty-one patients were included (31 males; mean age 38.6 years, median 38 years, range 16-83 years). The Helsinki score gave a better prognostic predictability compared to the other computerized tomographic scoring systems. Twenty-one (51.2%) patients had good recovery according to the Lagos Brain Disability Examination Scale grade. Conclusion(s): Patients' outcome prediction on the Lagos Brain Disability Examination Scale is best using the initial Helsinki computerized tomographic scoring system.

Comparison of four variable selection methods to determine the important variables in predicting the prognosis of traumatic brain injury patients by support vector machine,Pourahmad S.; Rasouli-Emadi S.; Moayyedi F.; Khalili H. ,"Background: Large amounts of information have called for increased computational complexity. Data dimension reduction is therefore critical to preliminary analysis. In this research, four variable selection (VS) methods are compared to obtain the important variables in predicting the prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective follow-up study, 741 TBI patients who were hospitalized for at least 2 days and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least one were followed. Their clinical data recorded during intensive care unit (ICU) admission and eight-category extended GOS conditions 6 months after discharge were utilized here. Two filter-and two wrapper-based VS methods were applied for comparison. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was then used, and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) values were calculated. Result(s): Theoretically, the variables selected by sequential forward selection (SFS) method would better predict the prognosis (AUC = 0.737, 95% confidence interval [0.701, 0.772], specificity = 89.2%, sensitivity = 58.9% and accuracy = 79.1%) than the others. Genetic algorithm (GA), minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), and mutual information method were in the next orders, respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of an SVM classifier on optimal subsets given by GA and SFS reveals that wrapper-based methods perform better than filter-based methods in our data set, although all selected subsets, except for the MRMR, were clinically accepted. In addition, for prognosis prediction of TBI patients, a small subset of clinical records during ICU admission is enough to achieve an accepted accuracy.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Predictive factors of survival and 6-month favorable outcome of very severe head trauma patients; a historical cohort study,Vathanalaoha K.; Oearsakul T.; Tunthanathip T. ,"Introduction: Very severe head trauma cases, defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of less than 6, have a higher mortality rate and poorer outcome. The purpose of this study was to recognize factors associated with survival and 6-month favorable outcome of very severe head trauma patients presenting to emergency department. Method(s): In this historical cohort study, the authors retrospectively reviewed medical records of head trauma patients who were admitted to the emergency department with post-resuscitation GCS scores of less than 6. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the association between various parameters with survival and 6-month outcome. Result(s): 103 cases with themean age of 39 +/- 16.5 years were studied (80% male). The overall survival rate was 41.7%and the rate of 6-month favorable outcome was 28.2%. Inmultivariate analysis, brisk pupil light reaction on admission and patent basal cistern on brain computed tomography (CT) scan were significant factors associated with both survival (OR 5.20, 95% CI 1.57-17.246, p = 0.007 and OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.22-10.91, p=0.02 respectively) and favorable outcome (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.35-12.24, p=0.01 and OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.22-10.26, p 0.02), respectively. Conclusion(s): Based on the results of present study, the survival rate of patientswith very severe head trauma (GCS < 6) was 41.7%. The strong predictors of survival and 6-month favorable outcome of these patients were brisk pupillary reactivity and patent cistern on brain CT scan. It seems that very severe head trauma patients still have a reasonable chance to survive and aggressive management should be continued.Copyright © (2017) Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.",2019,/,Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine,7,1,,,,631236484,#20502,Vathanalaoha 2019,,yes
"Epidemiological, clinical, prognostic aspects of severe brain injuries in Yaounde (Cameroon)",Bengono R.S.B.; Amengle A.L.; Mbengono J.A.M.; Esiene A.; Etoundi P.O.; Minkande J.Z. ,"Rationale: Brain injury is a major public health and socio-economic problem. The main cause is the road traffc accident. The aim of our study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and prognostic aspects of severe brain injuries (SBT) in Yaounde. Patients and Methods: It was a descriptive study with retrospective and prospective collection of data. The retrospective phase concerned the fles of patients admitted from January 2013 to November 2018. The prospective phase concerned patients received from December 2018 to May 2019 in the intensive care units of two hospitals. We included all patients over 5 years with brain injury and a Coma Glasgow Score < 9, in whom the consent of a family member was obtained for the prospective phase. Patient's data collection included: sociode-mographic characteristics, clinical data and prognosis. Continuous variables were described with average, median and standard variation. The Chi square test was used for the association of variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. Result(s): A total of 338 patients were recruited. The mean age was 37 +/- 19 years. The sex-ratio was 3.77. Road accidents were found in 91.4% of cases. Out-of-hospital care is inexistent. Patients were taken to hospital by non-medical means. The majority were polytrauma patients (83%). Maxillo-facial lesions were the most common. The cerebral CT-scan was not available in all patients. The most neurological signs were mydriasis in 201 patients (59.5%) and seizures (22.5%). More than half of the patients, 51.8% of the cases, had a delay of care less than 12 h. Thirty eightpatients (11.2%) received asurgical procedure. The infectious complications were the most common complication observed. The mortality rate was 59.2%. Factors associated with death were: age, motorcyclists, hypertension andhyperthermia. Conclusion(s): SBT are frequent. Road traffc accidents are the main cause.

Early hyperglycaemia in traumatic brain injury: About 380 cases,Haj T.E.; Chtara K.; Zayani R.A.; Bradai S.; Bahloul M.; Bouaziz M. ,"Rationale: Early hyperglycaemia in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a part of the stress response. It is an important indicator of severity and a reliable predictor of prognosis. We aimed to describe the epidemio-logical, clinical and paraclinical characteristics and to assess the prognostic impact of this hyperglycaemia on the TBI. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital between 2009 and 2012. Were included all patients with TBI and blood glucose > 8 mmol/L at the frst 24 h post-trauma. Result(s): During the study period, 694 patients were hospitalized in our ICU with TBI. Early hyperglycemia (> 8 mmol /l) was found in 380 patients (54.7%). In univariate analysis, glycaemia > 8.5 mmol/l (= 154 mg/dL) at admission was signifcantly associated with mortality (p = 0.015). We observed that glycaemia > 7.3 mmol/l at H12, > 7.2 mmol/l at H24, > 6.7 mmol/l at H36 and > 6.5 mmol/l at H48 was signifcantly associated with mortality (p = 0.07; p < 0.0001; p = 0.001 and p = 0.0008, respectively). The risk factors signifcantly associated with mortality were age > 32 years (p < 0.0001), SAPS II > 40 (p < 0.0001), initial shock (p < 0.0001), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 7/15 (p < 0.0001), coma period > 7 days (p = 0.023). The CT scan lesions statistically associated with mortality were: subdural hematoma (p < 0.0001), cerebral oedema (p < 0.0001), intra cerebral haemorrhage (p = 0.023), cortical contusion (p = 0.001), contusion of cerebral trunk (p = 0.011), contusion of the corpus callosum (p = 0.003), thalamus contusion (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors statistically associated with mortality were age > 32 years old (OR = 2.92 IC [1.52-5.78]; (p = 0.001)), glycaemia > 8.5 mmol/L at admission (OR = 2.25 IC[1.16-4.39]; (p = 0.017)),GCS < 7/15 (OR = 3.40 IC [1.8-6.24]; p < 0.001), intracerebral hematoma (OR = 3.2 IC [1.10-10.18]; p = 0.049).

"Prevalence, characteristics, risk factors, and short-term consequences of hyponatremia in intensive care unit patients with post-traumatic brain injury",Turki O.; Triki A.; Baccouche N.; Bouchaala K.; Mounir Y.; Bahloul M.; Bouaziz M. ,"Rationale: Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized patients. It is particularly common in brain-injured patients with signifcantly elevated morbidity and mortality. The aim was to study the prevalence of hyponatremia in the acute phase of post-traumatic cerebral aggression, its degree of severity, its predictive factors as well as its prognostic impact in the population of post-traumatic brain injury. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study, carried out over a period of 4 years about all traumatized head patients who developed hyponatremia during the frst 36 h of their stay. The descriptive part treated all patients who developed hyponatremia by detailing its different stages of severity.The analytical part treated the patients who developed a hypo-osmolar hyponatremia with a threshold of 130 mmol/L retained to defne the severity. Result(s): During the study period, the incidence of hyponatremia in head trauma patients was 30.8%. The occurrence of hyponatremia was associated only with the occurrence of early seizures (p = 0.006). Severe hyponatraemia was associated with paroxysmal occurrence (p = 0.002), mass effect (p = 0.01), and hemostasis disorders. The multi-variate study revealed that severe hyponatremia was associated with the Glasgow score (p < 0.001) and pupillary changes (p = 0.048). On the other hand, it is the initial variation in serum sodium that was associated with both the severity of the initial neurological examination; Glasgow (p < 0.001), SAPS2 (p = 0.001), PTS (p = 0.049) and PRISM scores (p = 0.007), haemodynamic instability (p = 0.07) and neurovegetative disorders (p = 0.04). Lesional features have also been found. Regarding the prognosis, the occurrence of initial hyponatremia had a protective effect: a more favorable GOS score p = 0.051 and a lower mortality (p = 0.045). A poor neurologic prognosis as well as a high mortality were associated with the most severe hyponatraemia and particularly with the initial variation of the sodium level (p = 0.002;). The mortality was 24.9%. It was also particularly related to the initial change in sodium levels (p < 0.001, 0.002). Conclusion(s): We concluded that there is no association between post traumatic early hyponatremia and the severity of the initial clinical presentation. However, the depth of hyponatremia and especially the initial change in sodium levels have been associated with more severe clinical pictures and a more limited prognosis.",2020,/,Annals of Intensive Care,10,Supplement 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-0623-7,631514421,#20455,Turki 2020,,yes
Prognostic assessment of combined NSE and S100 biomarkers on cognitive outcome after Traumatic Brain Injury,Muresanu D.F.; Slavoaca D.; Strilciuc S. ,"Background and aims: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is considered a possible risk factor for development of latelife dementia. The link between TBI and dementia development is inconclusive throughout the literature. We explored the association between TBI and dementia development cascade, specifically to investigate whether biomarkers Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium-binding protein B associated are predictors for cognitive outcome after TBI. Method(s): We performed 2ndary data analysis on TBI patients from a single-center clinical trial. NSE and S100 were determined at 48 and 72 hours after admission and neurocognitive outcomes were measured at study days 10, 30 and 90. Pooled ensembles were included in multivariate linear regression models to determine the predictive value of NSE, S100 and their combination on a multidimensional ensemble of TBI outcome scales, controlling for severity of the injury, age, and gender. Result(s): A total of 142 patients aged 19-79 with a diagnosis of TBI were included in multivariate linear regression models. A strong prediction value of NSE and S100 at 24h was observed for Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (30, 90 days), Stroop Color-Word Test, Digit Span (30, 90 days) and Processing Speed Index (10, 30, 90 days) and the combined outcome ensemble.

Admission lymphopenia predicts increased infectious complications and mortality in traumatic brain injury victims,Budreau D.; Campbell B.; Galet C.; McGonagill P.W. ,"Introduction: Severely injured patients often experience a severe acute inflammatory response with subsequent immunosuppression which increases susceptibility to secondary infections, as well as an increased risk of other complications and death. Lymphopenia in patients with sepsis is a predictor of mortality. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased risk of secondary infections, such as pneumonia. Herein, we determined whether lymphopenia in patients with TBI was associated with infectious complications and mortality. Method(s): The University of Iowa Trauma Registry was queried to identify all TBI patients with a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2 to 6 admitted to our Level I Trauma center between July 2008 and June 2015. TBI patients who had a complete blood count with differential (CBC w/ diff) collected within 24 h of admission were included. Exclusion criteria were death within 24 h after admission or bowel perforation on admission. Demographics, comorbidities, injury related data, admission data, comorbidities, CBC w/ diff results, complications, and mortality data were collected. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of 800 or less. Descriptive statistics were obtained, and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of mortality, pneumonia complication, and associated outcomes in TBI patients. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Out of 5619 patients with TBI, 1596 patients had a CBC w/ diff collected during the first 24 h. Our cohort was 58.6% male, with a mean age of 60.4 years (18 - 101) and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 19.4 (4 -75). Most patients presented with a head AIS of 3 (25.8%), 4 (50.6%), or 5 (18.5%). All cause infection, pneumonia, UTI, and mortality rates were 13.6%, 6.7%, 8.2%, and 7.3%, respectively. The lymphopenia rate was 26.2%. Multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, BMI, head AIS, pre-existing immunodeficiency, and infections, was performed demonstrating that lymphopenia was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.2 [1.43 - 3.39], p < 0.001). Furthermore, lymphopenia was associated with increased risk of all cause infection (OR 2.3 [1.69 -3.13] p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR 2.29 [1.51 - 3.48], p < 0 .001), and UTI (OR 2.17 [1.49 - 3.17], p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): TBI patients presenting with lymphopenia on admission are at increased risk of infectious morbidity and mortality. While additional analyses are required to assess the impact of associated injuries and comorbidities on our models, our preliminary results suggest that routine monitoring of CBC w/ diff on admission in TBI patients may provide important prognostic information. Further studies aiming at identifying early predictors of infection and mortality in TBI patients are warranted.",2020,/,Shock,53,Supplement 1,58,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000001570,632595449,#20431,Budreau 2020,,yes
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a prognostic biomarker for traumatic brain injury (TBI): A track-TBI study,Xu L.; Korley F.; Puccio A.; Ferguson A.; Sun S.; Mukherjee P.; Wang K.; Okonkwo D.; Manley G.; Jain S.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Objective: To estimate the accuracy of high sensitivity assays of CRP (hsCRP) as a prognostic biomarker for TBI. Background(s): The effect of the systemic inflammatory response on recovery after TBI has received relatively little attention. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a clinically useful and non-specific biomarker of systemic inflammation. Design/Methods: TRACK-TBI enrolled adult subjects with TBI who presented to eighteen Level I trauma centers within 24 hours of injury (n=308), as well as orthopedic control subjects who suffered extracranial injuries but no TBI (n=19). Analysis included participants with samples drawn at day 1, 14, and either day 3 or 5 after injury. hsCRP was measured on the Abbott Architect c8000, MULTIGENT CRP Vario assay. Unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) <5 at 6 months post-injury. Result(s): hsCRP levels were particularly elevated on days 3 and 5 after injury (median (IQR): 31.6 (7.3-70.6) mg/L on day 1, 99.3 (39.3-183.0) on day 3, 107.9 (46.5-185.6) on day 5, and 11.0 (3.4-42.6) on day 14). There was no significant difference in hsCRP between TBI subjects and orthopedic controls at any time point. TBI subjects with intracranial findings on CT had significantly higher hsCRP at every time point compared to those with negative CT scans (p=0.0237 on day 1, p<0.0001 on days 3, 5, and 14). Subjects with unfavorable recovery had significantly higher hsCRP at every time point in the first two weeks after injury compared to those with favorable recovery (p=0.024 on day 1, p<0.0001 on days 3, 5, and 14). hsCRP demonstrated good to excellent discriminative ability (C-statistic 0.789 on day 3, 0.769 on day 5, and 0.880 on day 14) for identifying subjects with unfavorable recovery. Conclusion(s): hsCRP is a promising prognostic biomarker for TBI. hsCRP, measured in the first two weeks post-injury, predicted unfavorable recovery at 6 months following TBI.",2020,/,Neurology,94,15 Supplement,,,,633066939,#20419,Xu 2020,,yes
YKL-40 and neuron-specific enolase as prognostic biomarkers in traumatic brain injury,Pavlov G.; Kazakova M.; Dichev V.; Vasilev D.; Simitchiev K.; Stefanov C.; Sarafian V. ,"Introduction: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young people [1]. The aim of the study is to assess how plasma and cerebrospinal levels of YKL-40 [2], independently or in combination with NSE, IL-6, TNF-alpha and CRP affect the clinical models and the outcome in TBI. Method(s): 30 patients with isolated severe TBI admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital St. George- Plovdiv from 2017 to 2018 were included. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were collected on the 24th and 96th hour after the injury. CSF samples were also collected from 15 adult cadavers and served as an age-matched and gender-matched control group. Levels of YKL-40, NSE, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were analyzed with ELISA. GCS, APACHE III and Marshall Classification were determined prior to randomization and at the 96th hour after admission. Outcome was assessed as in-hospital mortality and at six months mortality. Result(s): The CSF level of YKL-40 in the TBI group was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.005). CSF levels of NSE are significantly higher compared to plasma concentrations on 24-th hour in TBI patients. Mean plasma levels of YKL-40 and TNF-alpha were higher compared to CSF, but the difference was feeble. We found statistically significant difference in plasma levels of YKL-40 (p<0.001) and NSE (p<0.001) in patients with short survival. A significant correlation between plasma concentrations of YKL-40, TNF-alpha and NSE was determined. Conclusion(s): Plasma NSE concentration is the major independent variable which influenced the survival of TBI patients.

In this study we depicted the dynamic response of HRV to iatrogenic interventions. Method(s): Prospectively collected high resolution data of patients from multiple centers with severe TBI from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) cohort of the CENTER-TBI study were analyzed. Bad outcome was defined as having a Glasgow-Outcome-Scale GOSE between 1-3 at 6 months. HRV parameters were calculated according to international guidelines using a 5-minute sliding window, updated every 10s. Hourly and daily medians were further analyzed Results: We included 273 patients (11403 h analyzed).80% were male, 46+/-19 years old and had an initial GCS of 6 (IQR 3-10). 72 had at least one unresponsive pupil. Outcome data was available for 90.1% of patients with 50.8% (N=125/ 246) having a bad outcome. The ratio of LF (low frequency) to HF (high frequency) power (LF/HF ratio) was lower in patients with at least one unreactive pupil (1.2+/-1.1 vs.1.5+/-1.3, p=0.03) and who had a bad outcome (1.1+/- 0.9)vs. good outcome (1.8+/-1.4) (mean difference 0.69; 95%CI 0.38-0.99, p< 0.001) suggesting parasympathetic dominance.

Benchmarking outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury with the CRASH and IMPACT prediction models: A single center analysis in the Netherlands,Van De Peppel W.R.; Lingsma H.F.; Haitsma I.; Van Der Jagt M. ,"Introduction: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered a serious public health problem in Europe. Partly because of the heterogeneity of TBI, considerable uncertainty may exist in the expected outcome of patients. The International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) and the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) prediction models are considered the most widely validated prognostic models [1,2]. However, studies using these prediction models for benchmarking of outcomes have been scarce. We aimed to compare actual outcomes in a TBI cohort of critically ill TBI patients with predicted outcomes in a quality of care initiative in an Academic Hospital. Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study, we included consecutively admitted TBI patients to the ICU Adults of Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands between January 2018 and February 2019. Result(s): We included 87 patients with TBI. 14-day mortality was 25%, sixmonth mortality was 36% and six-month unfavourable outcome was 50%. The IMPACT core+CT+lab model predicted 34% 6-month mortality (vs 35% actual, p=0.89) and 51% unfavourable outcome (vs 50% actual, p=0.9). The 14-day mortality prediction by CRASH prognosis calculator was 43% versus actual 14-day mortality of only 25% (p=0.01), whereas 6-month unfavourable outcome prediction by CRASH was 67% (vs. 50% actual, p=0.02) (Figure 1).

Predictors of post-concussion syndrome in adults with acute mild traumatic brain injury presenting to the emergency department: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,Varner C.; Thompson C.; De Wit K.; Borgundvaag B.; Houston R.; McLeod S. ,"Introduction: The emergency department (ED) is the first point of health care contact for most head injured patients. Although early and spontaneous resolution occurs in most patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), between 15-30% develop post-concussion syndrome (PCS). To date, clinical prediction tools do not yet exist to accurately identify adult MTBI patients at risk of PCS. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of PCS within 30 days in adults with acute MTBI presenting to the ED. Method(s): This wasa secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted in three Canadian EDs evaluating prescribed light exercise compared to standard care. Adult (18-64 years) patients with a MTBI sustained within the preceding 48 hours were eligible for enrollment. Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at 7, 14, and 30 days. The primary outcome was the presence of PCS at 30 days, defined as the presence of >=3symptoms on the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) at 30 days. Backward, stepwise, multivariable logistic regression with a removal criterion probability of 0.05 was conducted to determine predictor variables independently associated with PCS at 30 days. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine appropriate inclusion of variables in the multivariable model. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): A total of 367 patients were enrolled, 18 (4.9%) withdrew, and 108 (29.4%) were lost to follow-up. Median (IQR) age was 32 (25 to 48) years, and 201 (57.6%) were female. Of the 241 patients who completed follow-up, 49 (20.3%) had PCS at 30 days. Headache at ED presentation (OR = 6.59; 95% CI: 1.31 to 33.11), being under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of injury (OR = 4.42; 95% CI: 1.31 to 14.88), the injury occurring via bike or motor vehicle collision (OR = 2.98; 95% CI: 1.39 to 6.40), history of anxiety or depression (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.23 to 5.03), and the sensation of numbness or tingling at ED presentation (OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.04 to 4.88), were independently associated with PCS at 30 days. Conclusion(s): Five variables were found to be significant predictors of PCS. Although MTBI is a self-limited condition in the majority of patients, patients with these risk factors should be considered high risk and flagged for early follow-up. There continues to be an urgent need for a clinical prognostic tool that accurately identifies adult patients at risk for PCS early in their injury.",2020,/,Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine,22,Supplement 1,S40,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cem.2020.144,633284733,#20400,Varner 2020,,yes

The level of HDL on 7th day also correlates with GOS, rs= 0,772, p=0,0019. Conclusion(s): PICS criteria can be used to predict poor outcome. However, maybe using HDL as marker it is be able to identify patients at risk of poor outcome TBI earlier. Further researches are needed.

Possible prognostic factors in older adults with traumatic brain injury,Henning K.; Espinoza S.; Jeong S.; Sanchez-Reilly S.; LaCoss J. ,"Purpose Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in older adults accounts for 80,000 ED visits per year, 75% require hospitalization. As the population of older adults increases, TBI rates continue to rise, primarily from falls secondary to frailty, immobility, and comorbidities. While TBI in older adults is common, outcomes and prognostic indicators remain understudied in literature. A retrospective chart review at a large county hospital was done to assess mortality, disposition at discharge, and correlations to poor outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 120 patients over the age of 65 with TBI during a 16-month period was completed. Patient age, sex, pre-injury and post-injury ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), mental status at admission, comorbidities and anticoagulation use were documented. Analysis by Chi Square, t-test, and logistical regression was done to assess mortality, dependence for ADLs at discharge, and possible prognostic factors for poor outcomes. Results Statistical analysis of the 120 older adults with TBI revealed a 20% in-hospital mortality rate and only 9% of patients independent for ADLs at discharge. The factors of age, sex, comorbidities excluding dementia, and anticoagulation use did not correlate with higher rates for poor outcomes of in-hospital mortality and post-injury disability (dependent for ADLs). Patients exhibiting altered mental status (AMS) at admission were 4x more likely to have in-hospital mortality and 16x more likely to have post-injury disability. Conclusion TBI in older adults has a high mortality rate and post-injury disability. AMS at admission correlated with higher rates of both in-hospital mortality and post-injury disability, suggesting AMS on presentation may be an important prognostic factor of TBI in patients over the age of 65. .",2020,/,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,68,SUPPL 1,S166,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16431,633776909,#20385,Henning 2020,,yes
Controlling nutritional status score and prognostic nutrition index predict the outcome after severe traumatic brain injury,Li Y.; Liu C.; Luo X.; He Q.; Cheng Y.; Shen W.; Xie Z. ,"Objectives: Immune-nutritional status is correlated with a clinical outcome in critical illness. Recently, controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and prognostic nutrition index (PNI) has been reported to predict prognosis following cancer and other diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the CONUT score and PNI and 6-month outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 78 patients with STBI, including the CONUT score and PNI. Patients were divided into high CONUT group and low CONUT group. Patients were also divided into high PNI and low PNI group respectively. The 6-month outcome was evaluated by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS score >=3. Result(s): The unfavorable outcome group had lower Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores, serum albumin, total cholesterol, PNI, and higher CONUT scores (P < 0.05). Both CONUT scores and PNI were strongly correlated with mRS (r = 0.429, P < 0.05; r = -0.590, P < 0.05, respectively). After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios of CONUT scores and PNI for predicting unfavorable outcome were 10.478 (95% CI: 2.793-39.301) and -0.039 (95% CI: 0.008-0.204), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of CONUT scores for predicting unfavorable outcome was 0.777 (95% CI: 0.674-0.880, P < 0.01), which was similar to PNI (0.764, 95% CI: 0.657-0.87, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Both CONUT scores and PNI might be novel independent predictors of the poor outcome in STBI.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,/,Nutritional Neuroscience,,"(Li, Luo, He, Cheng, Xie) Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China(Liu) Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China(Shen) Departm",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2020.1804097,2005816068,#20347,Li 2020,,yes
"Lactic acid, neuron-specific enolase, and blood-brain barrier index after a severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective study",Lu W.; Jiang C.; Wang Z.; Chen Y.; Bai R.; Yan G.; Wang G.; Ren H. ,"Objective: To explore the clinical significance of dynamic monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum Lactic acid(Lac), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) index in evaluating the condition and prognosis after a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): A total of 52 severe TBI patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery within 24 hours after injury were dynamically monitored. CSF and serum samples were collected on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th day after a severe TBI to monitor the changes in Lac, NSE, and the BBB index. Intracranial pressure (ICP), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), and 6-month Glasgow outcome scale-extended (GOS-E) were tested. According to the results of GOS-E, the patients were divided into two groups (i.e. the poor prognosis group and good prognosis group). Statistical analysis was conducted to investigate the clinical significance of dynamic monitoring of CSF and serum Lac, NSE, and BBB index after a severe TBI. Result(s): After a severe TBI, the levels of Lac, NSE, and BBB in CSF and serum were significantly higher than those in the normal range. Lac, NSE, and the BBB index did not correlate with ICP (except serum Lac) but had correlations with GCS and post-injury 6 months post-injury (except serum Lac). Moreover, the correlations between Lac, NSE, and BBB index were statistically significant (p < 0.05): CSF Lac and CSF NSE; CSF Lac and serum NSE; Lac and BBB index of CSF; Lac and BBB index of CSF; NSE and CSE of serum; CSF NSE and BBB index; and serum NSE and BBB index. Additionally, serum NSE is correlated with NSE in CSF (p < 0.05).

Expression of heat shock protein 70 and Annexin A1 in serum of patients with acutely severe traumatic brain injury,Zhao J.; Wang T.; Lv Q.; Zhou N. ,"Trends of early expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Annexin A1 (ANXA1) in serum of patients with acutely severe traumatic brain injury and the effects on clinical prognosis were investigated. Eighty-four patients with severe traumatic brain injury admitted to Binzhou Center Hospital from June 2014 to July 2017 were selected as the experimental group. Glasgow coma scale and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score were obtained after admission. A further 75 healthy subjects were selected as the control group. Serum expression of Hsp70 and ANXA1 in the two groups was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th day after admission. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic value of Hsp70 and ANXA1 for the death of patients with acutely severe traumatic brain injury. Compared with the control group, expression of Hsp70 in the experimental group was significantly increased on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th day after admission (P<0.05), while expression of ANXA1 was significantly decreased (P<0.05). Expression levels of serum Hsp70 in the experimental group reached the peak on the 3rd day after admission, and the difference was statistically significant compared with the 1st, 2nd and 4th day (P<0.05). Expression of ANXA1 was the lowest on the 3rd day, and the difference was statistically significant compared with the 1st, 2nd and 4th day (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of serum Hsp70 and ANXA1 was, respectively, 0.721 (95% CI: 0.611-0.829) and 0.684 (95% CI: 0.569-0.799). In conclusion, Hsp70 and ANXA1 may be involved in the occurrence and progression of acutely severe traumatic brain injury. The detection of serum Hsp70 and ANXA1 has certain diagnostic value for the death of patients with acutely severe traumatic brain injury.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

Risk factors for corticosteroid insufficiency during the sub-acute phase of acute traumatic brain injury,Chen X.; Chai Y.; Wang S.-B.; Wang J.-C.; Yue S.-Y.; Jiang R.-C.; Zhang J.-N. ,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction may lead to the occurrence of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency can easily occur after traumatic brain injury, but few studies have examined this occurrence. A multicenter, prospective, cohort study was performed to evaluate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the incidence of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency during the sub-acute phase of traumatic brain injury. One hundred and forty patients with acute traumatic brain injury were enrolled from the neurosurgical departments of three tertiary-level hospitals in China, and the critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency incidence, critical-illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency-related risk factors, complications, and 28-day mortality among these patients was recorded. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency was diagnosed in patients with plasma total cortisol levels less than 10 mug/dL (275.9 nM) on post-injury day 4 or when serum cortisol was insufficiently suppressed (less than 50%) during a dexamethasone suppression test on post-injury day 5. The results demonstrated that critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency occurred during the sub-acute phase of traumatic brain injury in 5.6% of patients with mild injury, 22.5% of patients with moderate injury, and 52.2% of patients with severe injury. Traumatic brain injury-induced critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency was strongly correlated to injury severity during the sub-acute stage of traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury patients with critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency frequently presented with hemorrhagic cerebral contusions, diffuse axonal injury, brain herniation, and hypotension. Differences in the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and 28-day mortality were observed between patients with and without critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency during the sub-acute phase of traumatic brain injury. Hypotension, brain-injury severity, and the types of traumatic brain injury were independent risk factors for traumatic brain injury-induced critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. These findings indicate that critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is common during the sub-acute phase of traumatic brain injury and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. The dexamethasone suppression test is a practical assay for the evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and for the diagnosis of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency in patients with traumatic brain injury, especially those with hypotension, hemorrhagic cerebral contusions, diffuse axonal injury, and brain herniation. Sub-acute infection of acute traumatic brain injury may be an important factor associated with the occurrence and development of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency.

Prediction of Early TBI Mortality Using a Machine Learning Approach in a LMIC Population,Amorim R.L.; Oliveira L.M.; Malbouisson L.M.; Nagumo M.M.; Simoes M.; Miranda L.; Bor-Seng-Shu E.; Beer-Furlan A.; De Andrade A.F.; Rubiano A.M.; Teixeira M.J.; Kolias A.G.; Paiva W.S. ,"Background: In a time when the incidence of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasing in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), it is important to understand the behavior of predictive variables in an LMIC's population. There are few previous attempts to generate prediction models for TBI outcomes from local data in LMICs. Our study aim is to design and compare a series of predictive models for mortality on a new cohort in TBI patients in Brazil using Machine Learning. Method(s): A prospective registry was set in Sao Paulo, Brazil, enrolling all patients with a diagnosis of TBI that require admission to the intensive care unit. We evaluated the following predictors: gender, age, pupil reactivity at admission, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), presence of hypoxia and hypotension, computed tomography findings, trauma severity score, and laboratory results. Result(s): Overall mortality at 14 days was 22.8%. Models had a high prediction performance, with the best prediction for overall mortality achieved through Naive Bayes (area under the curve = 0.906). The most significant predictors were the GCS at admission and prehospital GCS, age, and pupil reaction. When predicting the length of stay at the intensive care unit, the Conditional Inference Tree model had the best performance (root mean square error = 1.011), with the most important variable across all models being the GCS at scene. Conclusion(s): Models for early mortality and hospital length of stay using Machine Learning can achieve high performance when based on registry data even in LMICs. These models have the potential to inform treatment decisions and counsel family members. Level of Evidence: This observational study provides a level IV evidence on prognosis after TBI.© Copyright © 2020 Amorim, Oliveira, Malbouisson, Nagumo, Simoes, Miranda, Bor-Seng-Shu, Beer-Furlan, De Andrade, Rubiano, Teixeira, Kolias and Paiva.",2020,/,Frontiers in Neurology,10,"(Amorim, Oliveira) School of Medicine, Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Brazil(Amorim, Bor-Seng-Shu, De Andrade, Teixeira, Paiva) Division of Neurosurgery, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil(Malbouisson, Mirand",1366,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.01366,630821392,#20302,Amorim 2020,,yes
Sepsis in Traumatic Brain Injury: Epidemiology and Outcomes,Anderson D.; Kutsogiannis D.J.; Sligl W.I. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality include older age, co-morbidity, and TBI severity. Few studies have investigated the role of sepsis in individuals with TBI. Method(s): We studied adult patients with TBI admitted to intensive care over a 5-year period. Patient characteristics were identified by linking clinical and administrative databases. Charts of individuals with TBI and sepsis were manually reviewed. Predictors of ICU and hospital mortality were identified using logistic regression modeling. Result(s): Four hundred eighty-six individuals with TBI were admitted to intensive care. Sixteen (3.3%) developed sepsis. Pneumonia was the most common source (94%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (75%). ICU lengths of stay (LOS) (12.2 days [interquartile range (IQR) 4.4-23.5] versus 3.7 days [IQR 1.7-8.2]; p < 0.001) and hospital LOS (28.0 days [IQR 11.8-41.4] versus 15.3 days [IQR 5.0-30.9]; p = 0.017) were longer in patients with TBI and sepsis. Sepsis was not associated with ICU (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.51; 95%CI 0.12-2.27; p = 0.38) or hospital (aOR 0.78; 95% CI 0.21-2.96; p = 0.78) mortality, though age (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.04; p = 0.014 for hospital mortality), severe TBI (aOR 3.71; 95% CI 1.52-9.08; p = 0.004 for ICU mortality and 4.10; 95% CI 1.95-8.65; p < 0.001 for hospital mortality), and APACHE II score (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.28; p < 0.001 for ICU mortality and 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31; p < 0.001 for hospital mortality) were.

Blood-based biomarkers for prediction of intracranial hemorrhage and outcome in patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.,"Anderson, Taylor N; Hwang, Jun; Munar, Myrna; Papa, Linda; Hinson, Holly E; Vaughan, Allison; Rowell, Susan E","BACKGROUND: Early identification of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has implications for triage and intervention. Blood-based biomarkers were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prediction of ICH in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). We sought to determine if biomarkers measured early after injury improve prediction of mortality and clinical/radiologic outcomes compared with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) alone in patients with moderate or severe TBI (MS-TBI)., METHODS: We measured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) on arrival to the emergency department (ED) in patients with blunt TBI enrolled in the placebo arm of the Prehospital TXA for TBI Trial (prehospital GCS score, 3-12; SPB, > 90). Biomarkers were modeled individually and together with prehospital predictor variables [PH] (GCS score, age, sex). Data were divided into a training data set and test data set for model derivation and evaluation. Models were evaluated for prediction of ICH, mass lesion, 48-hour and 28-day mortality, and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Area under the curve (AUC) was evaluated in test data for PH alone, PH + individual biomarkers, and PH + three biomarkers., RESULTS: Of 243 patients with baseline samples (obtained a median of 84 minutes after injury), prehospital GCS score was 8 (interquartile range, 5-10), 55% had ICH, and 48-hour and 28-day mortality were 7% and 13%, respectively. Poor neurologic outcome at 6 months was observed in 34% based on GOS-E of 4 or less, and 24% based on DRS greater than or equal to7. Addition of each biomarker to PH improved AUC in the majority of predictive models. GFAP+PH compared with PH alone significantly improved AUC in all models (ICH, 0.82 vs. 0.64; 48-hour mortality, 0.84 vs. 0.71; 28-day mortality, 0.84 vs. 0.66; GOS-E, 0.78 vs. 0.69; DRS, 0.84 vs. 0.81, all p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Circulating blood-based biomarkers may improve prediction of neurological outcomes and mortality in patients with MS-TBI over prehospital characteristics alone. Glial fibrillary acidic protein appears to be the most promising.

This study explores the relationship between PRx and PbtO2 in adult moderate/severe TBI. Using the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) high resolution intensive care unit (ICU) sub-study cohort, we evaluated those patients with archived high-frequency digital intraparenchymal intracranial pressure (ICP) and PbtO2 monitoring data of, a minimum of 6 h in duration, and the presence of a 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale -Extended (GOSE) score. Digital physiological signals were processed for ICP, PbtO2, and PRx, with the % time above/below defined thresholds determined. The duration of ICP, PbtO2, and PRx derangements was characterized. Associations with dichotomized 6-month GOSE (alive/dead, and favorable/unfavorable outcome; <= 4 = unfavorable), were assessed. A total of 43 patients were included. Severely impaired cerebrovascular reactivity was seen during elevated ICP and low PbtO2 episodes. However, most of the acute ICU physiological derangements were impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, not ICP elevations or low PbtO2 episodes. Low PbtO2 without PRx impairment was rarely seen. % time spent above PRx threshold was associated with mortality at 6 months for thresholds of 0 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.734, p = 0.003), > +0.25 (AUC 0.747, p = 0.002) and > +0.35 (AUC 0.745, p = 0.002). Similar relationships were not seen for % time with ICP >20 mm Hg, and PbtO2 < 20 mm Hg in this cohort. Extreme impairment in cerebrovascular reactivity is seen during concurrent episodes of elevated ICP and low PbtO2. However, the majority of the deranged cerebral physiology seen during the acute ICU phase is impairment in cerebrovascular reactivity, with most impairment occurring in the presence of normal PbtO2 levels.

Levels of caspase-1 in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with traumatic brain injury: correlation with intracranial pressure and outcome.,"Perez-Barcena, Jon; Crespi, Catalina; Frontera, Guillem; Llompart-Pou, Juan Antonio; Salazar, Osman; Goliney, Victor; Ibanez, Javier; Bullock, M Ross; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo","OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate levels of inflammasome-signaling proteins in serum and CSF of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to correlate these protein levels with intracranial pressure (ICP) and clinical outcomes at 6 months after injury., METHODS: This is a prospective and observational study in patients with moderate and severe TBI who required an external ventricular drain as part of their treatment. Serum and CSF samples were collected 3 times a day for the first 5 days after TBI. The authors have determined the protein concentration of caspase-1 in the CSF and serum of patients with TBI by using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ICP value was recorded hourly. The 6-month outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended., RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included in this study, and a total of 234 paired serum-CSF samples were analyzed. The area under the curve (AUC) value of caspase-1 in CSF during the 5-day period was 2452.9 pg/mL.hr in the group of patients with high ICP vs 617.6 pg/mL.hr in the patients with low ICP. The differences were mainly on day 2 (19.7 pg/mL vs 1.8 pg/mL; p = 0.06) and day 3 (13.9 pg/mL vs 1 pg/mL; p = 0.05). The AUC value of caspase in CSF during the 5-day period was 1918.9 pg/mL.hr in the group of patients with poor outcome versus 924.5 pg/mL.hr in the patients with good outcome. The protein levels of caspase-1 in CSF were higher in patients with unfavorable outcomes during the first 96 hours after TBI., CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with TBI who were admitted to the neurosurgical ICU, the inflammasome protein caspase-1 is increased in the CSF of patients with high ICP, especially on days 2 and 3 after TBI.

Temporal Acute Serum Estradiol and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Associations and Risk of Death after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Kumar, Raj G; DiSanto, Dominic; Awan, Nabil; Vaughan, Leah E; Levochkina, Marina S; Weppner, Justin L; Wright, David W; Berga, Sarah L; Conley, Yvette P; Brooks, Maria M; Wagner, Amy K","Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) activates a robust systemic response that involves inflammatory and other factors, including estradiol (E2), associated with increased deaths. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a significant mediator of systemic shock, and it is an extra-gonadal transcription factor for E2 production. The study objectives were to test the hypotheses: (1) a positive feedback relationship exists between acute serum TNFalpha and E2; and (2) acute concentrations of E2 and TNFalpha are prognostic indicators of death after severe TBI. This prospective cohort study included N = 157 adults with severe TBI. Serum samples were collected for the first five days post-injury. The TNFalpha and E2 levels were averaged into two time epochs: first 72 h (T1) and second 72 h post-injury (T2). A cross-lag panel analysis conducted between T1 and T2 TNFalpha and E2 levels showed significant cross-lag effects: T1 TNFalpha and T1 E2 were related to T2 E2 and T2 TNFalpha, respectively. Cox proportional hazards multi variable regression models determined that increases in T1 E2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.81), but not T2 E2 (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.47), were associated with increased risk of death.

Functional status was evaluated by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and QOL by PAECC (Project for the Epidemiologic Analysis of Critical Care patients) questionnaire between 0 (normal QOL) to 29 points (worst QOL)., RESULTS: A total of 531 patients. Median(Quartile1,Quartile 3) age: 35 (22, 56) years. After 3-4 years, 175 died (33%). Survivor QOL was deteriorated (median total PAECC score: 5 (0, 11) points) although 75.76% of patients who survived showed good functional situation (GOS normal or mild dysfunction). An improvement in QOL scores between 1 and 3-4 years was observed (median PAECC score differences between 3-4 years and 1 year: - 1(- 4, 0) points). QOL score improved during this interval of time: 62.6% of patients.

"Associations between serum tau, neurological outcome, and cognition following traumatic brain injury.","Ni, Ping; Qiao, Yuting; Tong, Wusong; Zhao, Chunfang; Zheng, Ping","Objective: To investigate the dynamic change in the serum Tau protein early after acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its association with neurological outcome and cognitive function., Subjects and Methods: Around 229 patients with acute TBI and 30 healthy subjects were evaluated for the serum levels of Tau protein on 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after TBI. The relationships of the serum levels of Tau protein and initial GCS and GOS at 6 months post-injury were also analyzed. Further, 95 TBI patients were assessed with their cognitive function with Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score., Results: Serum Tau was significantly higher in patients with TBI at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The serum Tau at each point was significantly lower respectively in the patients with mild TBI than that in medium and severe TBI. The serum Tau was significantly lower in patients with good outcome compared to the poor outcome group. The early serum Tau was negatively correlated with both GCS and GOS. In the TBI group, 39 (41%) out of 95 patients developed cognitive dysfunction assessed by MoCA. Tau protein at day 1, 3, and 5 after TBI was significantly correlated with cognitive dysfunction at 6 months after TBI., Conclusions: Acute Tau associations with neurological outcomes and cognition may implicate white matter damage and neuronal degeneration.

Prognostic computed tomography Scores in traumatic brain injury.,"Rafay, Muhammad; Gulzar, Farhan; Iqbal, Noorulain; Sharif, Salman","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injuries represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and road traffic crashes account for a significant proportion of these injuries. It is one of the leading causes of death, especially among young adults, and, according to the World Health Organization, this will surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and disability by the year 2020 and lifelong disability is common in those who survive. It is also known as the silent epidemic. Many CT scan scoring systems for brain injury have been developed but none of them are validated. These scores are based on structural findings of CT scan to predict the prognosis. Marshall and Rotterdam are the two most widely used scoring systems., METHOD: This was an observational study with prospectively collected data. 903 consecutive patients with TBI. This study aimed to compare the Helsinki CT scoring system with the Rotterdam scoring system to find out the better score for the prognostic purpose by using the Glasgow outcome score., RESULTS: Helsinki CT scoring system was found to be the most accurate score among the others in predicting the outcome of the patient based on morphological findings in CT scan. These scores also guided us regarding the treatment plan and patients with the good prognostic outcome are usually treated aggressively. Also these scores guide clinicians whether to opt for a conservative approach or any intervention., CONCLUSION: In this study we compared, Rotterdam vs. Helsinki CT Scoring System. We observed that the Helsinki score was a better outcome predictor for TBI than the Rotterdam score and can be used as a single validated score in predicting outcome and guiding the treatment.

Strategic white matter injury associated with long-term information processing speed deficits in mild traumatic brain injury.,"Bai, Lijun; Bai, Guanghui; Wang, Shan; Yang, Xuefei; Gan, Shuoqiu; Jia, Xiaoyan; Yin, Bo; Yan, Zhihan","Deficits in information processing speed (IPS) are among the earliest and most prominent cognitive manifestations in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We investigated the impact of white matter fiber location on IPS outcome in an individual basis assessment. A total of 112 acute mild TBI with all CT negative underwent brain DTI and blood sampling for inflammation cytokines within 7 days postinjury and 72 age- and sex matched healthy controls with same assessments were enrolled. IPS outcome was assessed by the trail making test at 6-12 month postinjury in mild TBI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) features were extracted using a novel lesion-load analytical strategy to capture spatially heterogeneous white matter injuries and minimize implicit assumptions of uniform injury across diverse clinical presentations. Acute mild TBI exhibited a general pattern of increased and decreased FA in specific white matter tracts. The power of acute FA measures to identify patients developing IPS deficits with 92% accuracy and further improved to 96% accuracy by adding inflammation cytokines. The classifiers predicted individual's IPS and working memory ratings (r = .74 and .80, respectively, p < .001). The thalamo-cortical circuits and commissural tracts projecting or connecting frontal regions became important predictors. This prognostic model was also verified by an independent replicate sample. Our findings highlighted damage to frontal interhemispheric and thalamic projection fiber tracts harboring frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits as a predictor for processing speed performance in mild TBI.

Long-term Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Efficacy in Older Patients After Traumatic Brain Injury: Assessed by the Functional Independence Measure.,"Harada, Akio; Kawai, Nobuyuki; Ogawa, Tomoya; Hatakeyama, Tetsuhiro; Tamiya, Takashi","Instances of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the elderly have been increasing along with the aging of popula-tions. In the present study, we examined the effect of aging on long-term multidisciplinary in-patient rehabili-tation efficacy after TBI. Sixty-three patients with physical and cognitive impairments after TBI were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into 4 age groups (<= 24, 25-44, 45-64, >= 65 years) and the clinical charac-teristics and rehabilitation efficacy of each age group were determined. Functional disability was evaluated using motor and cognitive Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores. Rehabilitation efficacy was assessed by FIM gains during rehabilitation and compared among the groups. There were no statistically significant dif-ferences in motor and cognitive FIM gains among the age groups. However, cognitive FIM gain was limited in a subset of >= 65 patients, and initial cognitive measures could not predict cognitive FIM improvement. These results indicate that chronological age is insufficient to accurately predict rehabilitation efficacy in older TBI patients, and that such patients should be considered candidates for intensive rehabilitation programs based on these results. Accurate prognostication of rehabilitation efficacy with continuing data collection is important when using rehabilitation resources for older TBI patients.",2021,/,Acta medica Okayama,75,4,479-486,,https://dx.doi.org/10.18926/AMO/62400,34511615,#4180,Harada 2021,,yes
Functional recovery after brain injury: Independent predictors of psychosocial outcome one year after TBI.,"Ritter, Jonathan; Dawson, Jeremy; Singh, Rajiv K","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people aged under 40 in the UK. Many patients suffer residual deficits, which limits their functional recovery. The aim of this study was to determine independent predictors of functional outcome at 1-year post-TBI., METHODS: Utilising a prospective observational cohort design, 1131 consecutive adult admissions with non-recurrent TBI were recruited from the ED (Emergency Department). Using routine consultant-led follow up clinics, data was collected between August 2011 and July 2015. The Rivermead Head Injury Follow Up Questionnaire (RHFUQ) was used to measure psychosocial function at 1 year., RESULTS: A multiple linear regression model showed that previous psychiatric history (p < 0.001), lower Glasgow Coma Scale (p < 0.001), a severe CT scan (p = 0.002), aetiology of assault compared to sport (p = 0.011) and falls (p = 0.005), initial unemployment (p < 0.001) and no job at 8-10 weeks (p < 0.001) after TBI had a significant association with a worse RHFUQ score at 1 year. Follow up rate was >90 %., CONCLUSIONS: This study adds valuable information on the prognostic indicators of TBI recovery and possible targets for intervention. Future development of a validated prognostic model to predict long term functional outcomes after TBI will help improve long-term treatment of the condition. Copyright © 2021.

Digital signatures for early traumatic brain injury outcome prediction in the intensive care unit.,"Palepu, Anil K; Murali, Aditya; Ballard, Jenna L; Li, Robert; Ramesh, Samiksha; Nguyen, Hieu; Kim, Hanbiehn; Sarma, Sridevi; Suarez, Jose I; Stevens, Robert D","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading neurological cause of death and disability across the world. Early characterization of TBI severity could provide a window for therapeutic intervention and contribute to improved outcome. We hypothesized that granular electronic health record data available in the first 24 h following admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) can be used to differentiate outcomes at discharge. Working from two ICU datasets we focused on patients with a primary admission diagnosis of TBI whose length of stay in ICU was >= 24 h (N = 1689 and 127). Features derived from clinical, laboratory, medication, and physiological time series data in the first 24 h after ICU admission were used to train elastic-net regularized Generalized Linear Models for the prediction of mortality and neurological function at ICU discharge. Model discrimination, determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis, was 0.903 and 0.874 for mortality and neurological function, respectively. Model performance was successfully validated in an external dataset (AUC 0.958 and 0.878 for mortality and neurological function, respectively). These results demonstrate that computational analysis of data routinely collected in the first 24 h after admission accurately and reliably predict discharge outcomes in ICU stratum TBI patients.

Genetic Influences on Patient-Oriented Outcomes in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Living Systematic Review of Non-Apolipoprotein E Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms.,"Zeiler, Frederick A; McFadyen, Charles; Newcombe, Virginia F J; Synnot, Anneliese; Donoghue, Emma L; Ripatti, Samuli; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Gruen, Russel L; McAllister, Thomas W; Rosand, Jonathan; Palotie, Aarno; Maas, Andrew I R; Menon, David K","There is a growing literature on the impact of genetic variation on outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Whereas a substantial proportion of these publications have focused on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, several have explored the influence of other polymorphisms. We undertook a systematic review of the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-apolipoprotein E (non-APOE) genes associated with patient outcomes in adult TBI). We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and gray literature from inception to the beginning of August 2017 for studies of genetic variance in relation to patient outcomes in adult TBI. Sixty-eight articles were deemed eligible for inclusion into the systematic review. The SNPs described were in the following categories: neurotransmitter (NT) in 23, cytokine in nine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in 12, mitochondrial genes in three, and miscellaneous SNPs in 21. All studies were based on small patient cohorts and suffered from potential bias. A range of SNPs associated with genes coding for monoamine NTs, BDNF, cytokines, and mitochondrial proteins have been reported to be associated with variation in global, neuropsychiatric, and behavioral outcomes. An analysis of the tissue, cellular, and subcellular location of the genes that harbored the SNPs studied showed that they could be clustered into blood-brain barrier associated, neuroprotective/regulatory, and neuropsychiatric/degenerative groups. Several small studies report that various NT, cytokine, and BDNF-related SNPs are associated with variations in global outcome at 6-12 months post-TBI. The association of these SNPs with neuropsychiatric and behavioral outcomes is less clear. A definitive assessment of role and effect size of genetic variation in these genes on outcome remains uncertain, but could be clarified by an adequately powered genome-wide association study with appropriate recording of outcomes.",2021,/,Journal of neurotrauma,38,8,1107-1123,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5583,29799308,#4170,Zeiler 2021,,yes
Apolipoprotein E4 Polymorphism and Outcomes from Traumatic Brain Injury: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"McFadyen, Charles A; Zeiler, Frederick A; Newcombe, Virginia; Synnot, Anneliese; Steyerberg, Ewout; Gruen, Russel L; Rosand, Jonathan; Palotie, Aarno; Maas, Andrew I R; Menon, David K","The mortality of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been largely static despite advances in monitoring and imaging techniques. Substantial variance exists in outcome, not fully accounted for by baseline characteristics or injury severity, and genetic factors likely play a role in this variance. The aims of this systematic review were to examine the evidence for a link between the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism and TBI outcomes and where possible, to quantify the effect size via meta-analysis. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and gray literature in December 2017. We included studies of APOE genotype in relation to functional adult TBI outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies Risk of Bias Assessment Instrument and the prognostic studies adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. In addition, we contacted investigators and included an additional 160 patients whose data had not been made available for previous analyses, giving a total sample size of 2593 patients. Meta-analysis demonstrated higher odds of a favorable outcome following TBI in those not possessing an ApoE e4 allele compared with e4 carriers and homozygotes (odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.84; p = 0.02). The influence of APOE4 on neuropsychological functioning following TBI remained uncertain, with multiple conflicting studies. We conclude that the ApoE e4 allele confers a small risk of poor outcome following TBI, with analysis by TBI severity not possible based on the currently available published data.

Predicting the Individual Treatment Effect of Neurosurgery for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury in the Low-Resource Setting: A Machine Learning Approach in Uganda.,"Adil, Syed M; Elahi, Cyrus; Gramer, Robert; Spears, Charis A; Fuller, Anthony T; Haglund, Michael M; Dunn, Timothy W","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the ""individual treatment effect,"" ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention.

Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN)--prospective validation of risk prediction models for adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury to use to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care: a cohort study.,"Harrison, D A; Prabhu, G; Grieve, R; Harvey, S E; Sadique, M Z; Gomes, M; Griggs, K A; Walmsley, E; Smith, M; Yeoman, P; Lecky, F E; Hutchinson, P J A; Menon, D K; Rowan, K M","OBJECTIVES: To validate risk prediction models for acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to use the best model to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care in the NHS., DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: Sixty-seven adult critical care units., PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to critical care following actual/suspected TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15., INTERVENTIONS: Critical care delivered in a dedicated neurocritical care unit, a combined neuro/general critical care unit within a neuroscience centre or a general critical care unit outside a neuroscience centre., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) questionnaire and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 6 months following TBI., RESULTS: The final Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) study data set contained 3626 admissions. After exclusions, 3210 patients with acute TBI were included. Overall follow-up rate at 6 months was 81%. Of 3210 patients, 101 (3.1%) had no GCS score recorded and 134 (4.2%) had a last pre-sedation GCS score of 15, resulting in 2975 patients for analysis. The most common causes of TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs) (33%), falls (47%) and assault (12%). Patients were predominantly young (mean age 45 years overall) and male (76% overall). Six-month mortality was 22% for RTAs, 32% for falls and 17% for assault. Of survivors at 6 months with a known GOSE category, 44% had severe disability, 30% moderate disability and 26% made a good recovery. Overall, 61% of patients with known outcome had an unfavourable outcome (death or severe disability) at 6 months. Between 35% and 70% of survivors reported problems across the five domains of the EQ-5D-3L. Of the 10 risk models selected for validation, the best discrimination overall was from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI Lab model (IMPACT) (c-index 0.779 for mortality, 0.713 for unfavourable outcome). The model was well calibrated for 6-month mortality but substantially underpredicted the risk of unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between dedicated neurocritical care units and combined neuro/general critical care units. In lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, dedicated neurocritical care units had higher mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at small additional mean costs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 14,000 per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INB) of 17,000. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggested that the probability that dedicated compared with combined neurocritical care units are cost-effective is around 60%. There were substantial differences in case mix between the 'early' (within 18 hours of presentation) and 'no or late' (after 24 hours) transfer groups. After adjustment, the 'early' transfer group reported higher lifetime QALYs at an additional cost with an ICER of 11,000 and INB of 17,000., CONCLUSIONS: The risk models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to support their use in research but fell below the level required to guide individual patient decision-making. The results suggest that management in a dedicated neurocritical care unit may be cost-effective compared with a combined neuro/general critical care unit (although there is considerable statistical uncertainty) and support current recommendations that all patients with severe TBI would benefit from transfer to a neurosciences centre, regardless of the need for surgery.

Prehospital neurologic deterioration is independent predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury: analysis from National Trauma Data Bank.,"Majidi, Shahram; Siddiq, Farhan; Qureshi, Adnan I","BACKGROUND: The prevalence and impact of prehospital neurologic deterioration (PhND) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not been investigated. We aimed to determine the prevalence of PhND during emergency medical service (EMS) transportation among patients with TBI and its impact on patient's outcome., METHODS: We used the National Trauma Data Bank, using data files from 2009 to 2010 to identify patients with TBI through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ascertained at the scene by EMS was compared with the subsequent GCS score evaluation in the emergency department (ED) to identify neurologic deterioration (defined as a decrease in GCS of >=2 points). Patients' demographics, initial injury severity score (ISS), admission GCS score, and hospital outcome were compared between patients with PhND and patients without neurologic deterioration., RESULTS: A total of 257 127 patients with TBI were identified. Among patients with TBI, 22 254 patients had PhND, which comprised 9% of all patients with TBI. The mean of GCS score decrease during EMS transport was 5 points (+/-3). Patients without PhND tended to have higher GCS recorded by EMS (median, 15 vs 12; P < .0001). Patients with TBI who had PhND had significantly higher hospital length of stay and intensive care unit days after adjusting for baseline characteristics and EMS GCS score, EMS transport time, type of injury, presence of intracranial hemorrhages, and ED ISS (P < .0001). These patients had higher rate of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for the same variables (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-2.41)., CONCLUSION: Prehospital neurologic deterioration occurs in 9% of patients with TBI. It is more prevalent in men and associated with lower EMS GCS level and higher ED ISS.

DTI in 69 patients with mTBI (47 male and 22 female patients) and 21 control subjects (10 male and 11 female subjects) with normal conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images were retrospectively reviewed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated as a measure of white matter integrity. Patients with mTBI underwent serial neurocognitive testing with Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). Correlation between sex, white matter FA values, ImPACT scores, and time to symptom resolution (TSR) were analyzed with multivariate analysis and TBSS., RESULTS: No significant difference in age was seen between males and females (control subjects, P = .3; patients with mTBI, P = .34).

Factors which influence conversational discourse performance were also explored., METHODS: The conversational discourse checklist of the Protocole Montreal d'evaluation de la communication (D-MEC) was administered in an acute tertiary care trauma centre to 195 adults within 3 weeks post-TBI. Outcome was measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) and included discharge destinations from acute care., MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Linear regression results showed that the D-MEC total score, age and initial GCS score accounted for 50% of the variation of the DRS scores. The DRS score was lower, signifying better outcome, when the total D-MEC score was higher, the subject was younger and when the initial GCS score was higher. Moreover, D-MEC performance significantly predicted the moderate and severe disability categories of the GOS-E and the probability of requiring rehabilitation (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: These results provide additional information to guide healthcare professionals in predicting overall outcome acutely post-TBI.",2014,/,Brain injury,28,7,951-8,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.888760,24826957,#7724,LeBlanc 2014,,yes
Elevated cell-free plasma DNA level as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Rodrigues Filho, Edison Moraes; Simon, Daniel; Ikuta, Nilo; Klovan, Caroline; Dannebrock, Fernando Augusto; Oliveira de Oliveira, Carla; Regner, Andrea","Trauma is the leading cause of death in individuals less than 45 years old worldwide, and up to 50% of trauma fatalities are because of brain injury. Prediction of outcome is one of the major problems associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and research efforts have focused on the investigation of biomarkers with prognostic value after TBI. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether cell-free DNA concentrations correlated to short-term primary outcome (survival or death) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores after severe TBI. A total of 188 patients with severe TBI were enrolled in this prospective study; outcome variables comprised survival and neurological assessment using the GCS at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Control blood samples were obtained from 25 healthy volunteers. Peripheral venous blood was collected at admission to the ICU. Plasma DNA was measured using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the beta-globin gene. There was correlation between higher DNA levels and both fatal outcome and lower hospital admission GCS scores. Plasma DNA concentrations at the chosen cutoff point (>=171,381 kilogenomes-equivalents/L) predicted mortality with a specificity of 90% and a sensitivity of 43%. Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated plasma DNA levels were independently associated with death (p<0.001).

Prognostic factors for outcome were analyzed by univariate analysis., RESULTS: Long-term follow up with outcome assessment according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) showed good recovery in 16 cases, moderate disability in two cases, severe disability in one case, and death in two cases. During surgery the origin of bleeding could be identified in all 21 cases. A rupture of the distal anterior cerebral artery or veins in the interhemispheric fissure was seen more frequently in patients with whole interhemispheric fissure hematoma, while hemorrhage from brain tissue laceration was seen more frequently in patients with more localized hematomas. The outcome in patients with an identified rupture of a vessel was better than in those with cortical laceration. Preoperative GCS score and thickness of the interhemispheric hematoma were correlated with outcome (P=0.001 and P=0.004, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Outcome after surgical treatment for TISH can be good, and careful surgical planning and microsurgical techniques to preserve venous drainage are essential.",2014,/,Turkish neurosurgery,24,2,228-33,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.8377-13.0,24831365,#7720,Wang 2014,,yes

Predicting outcome after traumatic brain injury: development of prognostic scores based on the IMPACT and the APACHE II.,"Raj, Rahul; Siironen, Jari; Kivisaari, Riku; Hernesniemi, Juha; Skrifvars, Markus B","Prediction models are important tools for heterogeneity adjustment in clinical trials and for the evaluation of quality of delivered care to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We sought to improve the predictive performance of the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials) prognostic model by combining it with the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) for 6-month outcome prediction in patients with TBI treated in the intensive care unit. A total of 890 patients with TBI admitted to a large urban level 1 trauma center in 2009-2012 comprised the study population. The IMPACT and the APACHE II scores were combined using binary logistic regression. A randomized, split-sample technique with secondary bootstrapping was used for model development and internal validation. Model performance was assessed by discrimination (by area under the curve [AUC]), calibration, precision, and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Overall 6-month mortality was 22% and unfavorable neurological outcome 47%. The predictive power of the new combined IMPACT-APACHE II models was significantly superior, compared to the original IMPACT models (AUC, 0.81-0.82 vs. 0.84-0.85; p<0.05) for 6-month mortality prediction, but not for unfavorable outcome prediction (AUC, 0.81-0.82 vs. 0.83; p>0.05). However, NRI showed a significant improvement in risk stratification of patients with unfavorable outcome by the IMPACT-APACHE II models, compared to the original models (NRI, 5.4-23.2%; p<0.05). Internal validation using split-sample and resample bootstrap techniques yielded equivalent results, indicating low grade of overestimation. Our findings show that by combining the APACHE II with the IMPACT, improved 6-month outcome predictive performance is achieved.

This study investigated whether MMP-9 could be used for outcome prediction after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the TBI group, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected at different days after surgery from 6 head injury patients who had received surgical intervention with external ventricular drainage insertion. CSF collected from non-TBI patients (N=85) diagnosed with isolated hydrocephalus by a ventricular puncture during a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt surgery was used as control., RESULTS: The mean concentration of MMP-9 in the CSF of 85 non-TBI patients was determined to be 1.172 +/- 0.859 ng/mL. We found that the CSF MMP-9 concentration from TBI patients was elevated immediately after head injury with a median of 1.926 ng/mL (range, 0.673 to 24.990). Despite an early increase in the concentration of MMP-9, levels decreased within 72 hrs and nearly reached the normal range. Nevertheless, the concentration of MMP-9 was negatively correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (gamma = - 0.337, p = 0.013)., CONCLUSION: MMP-9 concentration in the CSF of TBI patients correlated with neurological outcome and may represent an early indicator for the prognosis of this condition.",2014,/,Turkish neurosurgery,24,3,363-8,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.8551-13.0,24848175,#7708,Liu 2014,,yes
The influence of BMX gene polymorphisms on clinical symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Wang, Yu-Jia; Hsu, Yu-Wen; Chang, Che-Mai; Wu, Chung-Che; Ou, Ju-Chi; Tsai, Yan-Rou; Chiu, Wen-Ta; Chang, Wei-Chiao; Chiang, Yung-Hsiao; Chen, Kai-Yun","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common neurological disorders. Most patients diagnosed with mTBI could fully recover, but 15% of patients suffer from persistent symptoms. In recent studies, genetic factors were found to be associated with recovery and clinical outcomes after TBI. In addition, results from our previous research have demonstrated that the bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X (BMX), a member of the Tec family of kinases, is highly expressed in rats with TBI. Therefore, our aim in this study was to identify the association between genetic polymorphisms of BMX and clinical symptoms following mTBI. Four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of BMX with minimum allele frequency (MAF) >1% were selected from the HapMap Han Chinese database. Among these polymorphisms, rs16979956 was found to be associated with the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) scores within the first week after head injury. Additionally, another SNP, rs35697037, showed a significant correlation with dizziness symptoms.

Patients with head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or greater were selected, and mortality was examined within EMS systolic blood pressure (SBP) groups: lower than 100 mm Hg, 110 mm Hg to 150 mm Hg, 160 mm Hg to 180 mm Hg, and 190 mm Hg to 230 mm Hg. A forward logistic regression model including the EMS heart rate, EMS SBP, EMS Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ED heart rate, and ED SBP was used to identify predictors of a TBI in patients with ED GCS score of less than or equal to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 15., RESULTS: For the 5-year study period, 315,242 patients met inclusion criteria. Adjusted odds for mortality increased in a stepwise fashion with increasing EMS SBP compared with patients with normal EMS SBP (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.33 [1.22-1.44], p < 0.001, for EMS SBP of 160-180 mm Hg and 1.97 [1.76-2.21], p < 0.001, for EMS SBP of 190-230 mm Hg). A 7-point scoring system was developed for each ED GCS score group to predict the presence of a TBI. EMS SBP of greater than 150 mm Hg and ED SBP of greater than 150 mm Hg were both predictive of the presence of a TBI in patients with ED GCS score of 8 or less and in patients with ED GCS score of 9 to 13 or 14 to 15, respectively., CONCLUSION: Prehospital hypertension in TBI is associated with a higher mortality risk.

However, the diagnosis of PTH is not straightforward and despite shunting recovery may be delayed., OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of PTH on recovery and outcome during rehabilitation., METHODS: We studied 417 patients with severe TBI admitted consecutively to a single hospital-based neurorehabilitation department serving Eastern Denmark between 2000 and 2010. Demographics (age and gender) and clinical characteristics (length of acute treatment, post traumatic amnesia (PTA), level of consciousness, injury severity (ISS), and admission FIM TM), and PTH were related to recovery (discharge FIM TM), outcome (GOS), and length of rehabilitation stay., RESULTS: Patients with PTH were older, brain injury more severe, and acute treatment was longer. At discharge they had more disability, longer rehabilitation stays, and unfavorable outcome. However, after adjusted multiple regression analyses PTH was not associated with disability at discharge or outcome. Instead, PTH was associated with longer stay for rehabilitation., CONCLUTIONS: Shunting for PTH does not affect recovery and outcome per se, but prolongs lengths of stay by almost 3 weeks.

Prognostication and risk stratification of TBI patients is complex and often inaccurate. There is a great need for improved markers of injury severity and prognostic information. Objective(s): To determine whether elevated levels of serum biomarkers of structural brain injury are predictors of unfavorable clinical outcome assessed 6 months after moderate and severe acute TBI. Method(s): BIO-ProTECT is an NIH-sponsored, prospective, ancillary study of biomarker levels measured in blood samples obtained from patients participating in the ProTECT III randomized clinical trial of intravenous progesterone versus placebo in moderate and severe TBI. Baseline serum samples were obtained, using standard operating procedures, within 4 hours of TBI and analyzed for the presence of four biomarkers, using immunoassays for: glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), S100B, aII-Spectrin Breakdown Product of molecular weight 150 (SBDP150), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1). Patient outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) at 6 months. The association between log-transformed biomarker levels and dichotomized outcome, adjusted for baseline covariates, was determined via logistic regression. Result(s): There were 567 patients with baseline blood samples. In the placebo arm (n=281), the mean age was 39 +/- 17.5 and 24.6% were female; 33.5% had moderate TBI (GCS 9-12), 51.1% moderately severe TBI (GCS 6-8), and 15.4% had most severe TBI (GCS 4-5). The logtransformed biomarker levels in relation to dichotomized outcome are shown in Figure 152. Three biomarkers were significantly, and one marginally, associated with unfavorable outcome: S100B (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.35-2.76; p<0.001), SBDP150 (OR 1.60, 1.11-2.30; p=0.012), GFAP (OR 1.61, 1.24-2.08; p<0.001), UCH-L1 (OR 1.50, 0.95-2.36; p=0.084). Similar findings were present in the progesterone arm (n=286).

Intraventricular hemorrhage on early CT predicts poorer short-and long-term outcome in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury,Kowalski R.G.; Weintraub A.; Mellick D.; Nakamura T.; Gerber D.; Harrison-Felix C. ,"Objective(s): To evaluate whether intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) on early CT independently predicts outcome in TBI. Design(s): Retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data. Setting(s): Rocky Mountain Regional Brain Injury System. Participant(s): Patients enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database at a single center. Intervention(s): No study specific interventions. Main Outcome Measure(s): Duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA); Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE), FIMTM, Supervision Rating Scale (SRS) at acute rehabilitation admission and discharge or at follow up 1, 2 and 5 years after injury. Result(s): Between 1998 and 2014, 707 adult TBI patients with computed tomography (CT) were enrolled in the TBIMS database. Mean age was 36 +/- 14 years, and 77% were male. IVH was observed in 170 (24%) patients. In univariate analyses, patients with IVH were less likely to follow commands at injury onset, and had longer PTA, and lower FIM total scores at rehabilitation admission and discharge. IVH patients were more likely to have concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage, frontal cortical contusion, and white matter contusion. Independent predictors of poorer outcome (GOS-E scores 1-4) at one-year follow up were higher frequency of Charlson Index comorbidities (AOR, 1.443; 95% CI, 1.099- 1.894; p=0.008), IVH (AOR, 2.049; 95% CI, 1.312-3.205; p=0.002), subcortical contusion (AOR, 2.433; 95% CI, 1.447-4.098, p=0.001) and midline shift or cistern compression (AOR, 2.096; 95% CI, 1.389-3.175; p<0.001). IVH also independently predicted longer PTA duration, longer time to resume following commands, and continuing dependence (SRS>1) one year after injury. IVH did not predict outcome at 2- and 5- year follow up. Conclusion(s): Intraventricular hemorrhage on early CT independently predicts poorer short- and long-term outcome in TBI.

We hypothesized that GRE measurements of total TMBs, corpus callosum TMBs, and dorsal brainstem TMBs each independently predict 1-year functional outcomes in patients with TBI. Methods Functional outcome data were collected from a prospective database of 350 patients treated for TBI during the time period 1999 to 2007. 53 database enrollees who underwent an MRI scan with GRE between hospital admission and post-trauma day 14 were retrospectively identified. A neurologist blinded to the clinical data performed GRE assessment of TMBs in 20 pre-specified brain regions. The primary outcome was the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) score at 1 year post-injury. Spearman correlations were tested between total TMBs, regional TMBs, and 1-year DRS score, accounting for potential confounders: age and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Results The 53-patient TBI cohort was comprised of 38 men and 15 women. Average age was 43+/-23 years, and median admission GCS score was 7 (range 3-15). Neither age nor admission GCS correlated with 1-year DRS. Total TMBs did not correlate with 1-year DRS, but regional TMBs in the dorsal pons (R=0.25, p=0.04) and basal ganglia (R=0.25, p=0.03) did correlate with 1-year DRS. The statistical significance of these results, however, did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions TMBs in the dorsal pons and basal ganglia may have greater utility than total TMBs for predicting 1-year functional outcomes in patients with TBI. Larger prospective studies using higher resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging are needed to further elucidate the prognostic value of TMBs within these regions.",2015,/,Neurocritical Care,23,1 SUPPL. 1,S40,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-015-0193-y,72235535,#23026,Izzy 2015,,yes

","Objective: We aimed to explore the added value of common machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of outcome for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Study Design and Setting: We performed logistic regression (LR), lasso regression, and ridge regression with key baseline predictors in the IMPACT-II database (15 studies, n = 11,022). ML algorithms included support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and artificial neural networks and were trained using the same predictors. To assess generalizability of predictions, we performed internal, internal-external, and external validation on the recent CENTER-TBI study (patients with Glasgow Coma Scale <13, n = 1,554). Both calibration (calibration slope/intercept) and discrimination (area under the curve) was quantified. Result(s): In the IMPACT-II database, 3,332/11,022 (30%) died and 5,233(48%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale less than 4). In the CENTER-TBI study, 348/1,554(29%) died and 651(54%) had unfavorable outcome. Discrimination and calibration varied widely between the studies and less so between the studied algorithms. The mean area under the curve was 0.82 for mortality and 0.77 for unfavorable outcomes in the CENTER-TBI study. Conclusion(s): ML algorithms may not outperform traditional regression approaches in a low-dimensional setting for outcome prediction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Similar to regression-based prediction models, ML algorithms should be rigorously validated to ensure applicability to new populations.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2020,/,Journal of Clinical Epidemiology,122,"(Gravesteijn) Departments of Public Health, Erasmus MC - University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Postbus 2040, Rotterdam, CA 3000, Netherlands(Nieboer, Lingsma, Steyerberg) Departments of Public Health, Erasmus MC - University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotte",95-107,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.03.005,2005518279,#20279,Gravesteijn 2020,,yes
"Serum SNTF, a Surrogate Marker of Axonal Injury, Is Prognostic for Lasting Brain Dysfunction in Mild TBI Treated in the Emergency Department",Siman R.; Cui H.; Wewerka S.S.; Hamel L.; Smith D.H.; Zwank M.D. ,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) causes persisting post-concussion syndrome for many patients without abnormalities on conventional neuroimaging. Currently, there is no method for identifying at-risk cases at an early stage for directing concussion management and treatment. SNTF is a calpain-derived N-terminal proteolytic fragment of spectrin (alphaII-spectrin1-1176) generated in damaged axons following mTBI. Preliminary human studies suggest that elevated blood SNTF on the day of mTBI correlates with white matter disruption and lasting brain dysfunction. Here, we further evaluated serum SNTF as a prognostic marker for persistent brain dysfunction in uncomplicated mTBI patients treated in a Level I trauma center emergency department. Compared with healthy controls (n = 40), serum SNTF increased by 92% within 24 h of mTBI (n = 95; p < 0.0001), and as a diagnostic marker exhibited 100% specificity and 37% sensitivity (AUC = 0.87). To determine whether the subset of mTBI cases positive for SNTF preferentially developed lasting brain dysfunction, serum levels on the day of mTBI were compared with multiple measures of brain performance at 90 days post-injury. Elevated serum SNTF correlated significantly with persistent impairments in cognition and sensory-motor integration, and predicted worse performance in each test on a case by case basis (AUC = 0.68 and 0.76, respectively). SNTF also predicted poorer recovery of cognitive stress function from 30 to 90 days (AUC = 0.79-0.90). These results suggest that serum SNTF, a surrogate marker for axonal injury after mTBI, may have potential for the rapid prognosis of lasting post-concussion syndrome and impaired functional recovery following CT-negative mTBI. They provide further evidence linking axonal injury to persisting brain dysfunction after uncomplicated mTBI. A SNTF blood test, either alone or combined with other markers of axonal injury, may have important utilities for research, prognosis, management and treatment of concussion.© Copyright © 2020 Siman, Cui, Wewerka, Hamel, Smith and Zwank.",2020,/,Frontiers in Neurology,11,"(Siman, Cui, Smith) Department of Neurosurgery, Center for Brain Injury and Repair, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States(Wewerka, Hamel, Zwank) Department of Emergency Medicine, Regions Hospital, St. Pau",249,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00249,631537823,#20267,Siman 2020,,yes
Papilloedema as a single prognostic factor in moderate head injured adult patients,Mattar M.A.B.; Sabry A.; Saleh S. ,"Background & objective: Papilledema is optic disc swelling due to high intracranial pressure (ICP). Bilateral papilledema is caused by increased subarachnoid pressure around the optic nerves, a phenomenon that is usually accompanies the elevated ICP in patients exposed to significant head trauma, and since it is a bedside diagnosis, it could be performed initially on admission and repeated whenever required, to find out the value of tracking papilledema and its impact on prognosis in moderate head trauma in absence of ICP monitoring. Patients and Methods: A number of selected 72 adult patients, admitted to emergency hospital, who sustained isolated moderate head injury (GCS = 9-12), with proven CT scan brain devoid of either immediate or delayed intracranial mass lesion, or any significant surgical indications (e.g. depressed fracture). Patients with anterior fossa fracture were also excluded when associated with periorbital swelling, oedema, or ecchymosis, as well as cases who developed post traumatic cranial nerve palsy related to eyes (e.g. oculomotor nerve palsy), also cases that necessitated mechanical ventilation were excluded in this study. Bilateral fundoscopy was done, initially within 24 h of admission, then in the next 3rd day, while patients subjected to the regular indicated medical management. Glasgow outcome score (GOS) was identified to all patients after two weeks of admission, after routine follow up CT brain to rule out development of new intracranial lesions. Result(s): The study comprised 72 patients (males = 48, females = 24), with age range (23-52 years). GCS on admission = (9 for 8 patients, 10 for19, 11 for 21, and 12 for 24 patients). Bilateral papilloedema found in 23 cases in the early 24 hrs, then in 14 more patients at 72 hrs (total = 37). CT scan revealed NAD in 35 cases, brain edema in12, surface contusions in 18, SAH in 8, and pneumocephalus in 4 cases. Patients who developed early papilloedema that persist to 72 hrs., were associated with the worst GOS, compared to those who were free of papilloedema from the start (the group with the best GOS). Whereas those who developed late papilloedema (at 72hrs) showed better GOS. Conclusion(s): Tracking papilloedema may be useful in early outcome prediction in moderate head injured adult patients, besides its value in detection and control of increased intracranial tension.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2020,/,Interdisciplinary Neurosurgery: Advanced Techniques and Case Management,21,"(Mattar, Sabry) Department of Neurosurgery, Mansoura University, Egypt(Saleh) Ophthalmology Department, Mansoura Univerisity, Egypt",100699,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inat.2020.100699,2006107644,#20239,Mattar 2020,,yes
A traumatic brain injury prognostic model to support in-hospital triage in a low-income country: A machine learning-based approach,Rocha T.A.H.; Elahi C.; Da Silva N.C.; Sakita F.M.; Fuller A.; Mmbaga B.T.; Green E.P.; Haglund M.M.; Staton C.A.; Vissoci J.R.N. ,"Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with a disproportionate burden of this injury on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Limited access to diagnostic technologies and highly skilled providers combined with high patient volumes contributes to poor outcomes in LMICs. Prognostic modeling as a clinical decision support tool, in theory, could optimize the use of existing resources and support timely treatment decisions in LMICs. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning-based prognostic model using data from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, Tanzania. Method(s): This study is a secondary analysis of a TBI data registry including 3138 patients. The authors tested nine different machine learning techniques to identify the prognostic model with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Input data included demographics, vital signs, injury type, and treatment received. The outcome variable was the discharge score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Result(s): The AUC for the prognostic models varied from 66.2% (k-nearest neighbors) to 86.5% (Bayesian generalized linear model). An increasing Glasgow Coma Scale score, increasing pulse oximetry values, and undergoing TBI surgery were predictive of a good recovery, while injuries suffered from a motor vehicle crash and increasing age were predictive of a poor recovery. Conclusion(s): The authors developed a TBI prognostic model with a substantial level of accuracy in a low-resource setting. Further research is needed to externally validate the model and test the algorithm as a clinical decision support tool.Copyright © AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law.",2020,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,132,6,1961-1969,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.2.JNS182098,2006087674,#20236,Rocha 2020,,yes
The role of serum Dickkopf-1 in predicting 30-day death in severe traumatic brain injury,Ke X.; Yang M.; Luo J.-M.; Zhang Y.; Chen X.-Y. ,"Objective: Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of the canonical/-catenin cascade of the Wnt pathway, was upregulated in brain tissues of hemorrhagic stroke rats, and its rising circulating levels were associated with poor prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients. We attempted to ascertain the relationship between serum DKK-1 levels and 30-day death after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Material(s) and Method(s): Serum DKK-1 levels were gauged in a total of 94 sTBI patients and 94 healthy controls. Trauma severity was assessed using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Rotterdam classification based on head computerized tomography scan. Prognostic variable was 30-day death. Result(s): Compared with controls, serum DKK-1 levels were substantially elevated in patients (median value, 3.7 versus 1.0 ng/ml). Area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.802 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.708-0.877) for predicting 30-day death. Adjusted logistic regression showed that serum DKK-1 levels above 3.7 ng/ml remained as an independent marker of 30-day death (odds ratio, 8.573; 95% CI, 1.386-53.020) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 7.322; 95% CI, 1.320-40.622). An intimate correlation existed between DKK-1 levels and GCS scores (r = -.649) in addition to Rotterdam classification (r =.664). Conclusion(s): High serum levels of DKK-1 are closely associated with increasing severity and rising short-term mortality of sTBI.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Factors influencing recovery from mild traumatic brain injury,Johnson L.W.; Lundgren K.; Henrich V.; Phillips S. ,"Primary Objective: This study determined whether initial GCS score, head CT results, cognitive performance on IMPACT testing, or APOE genotype most effectively predicted 1-month functional outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study tested the hypotheses that participants with poor performance on initial cognitive testing and those with an APOEe4 genotype would exhibit a poorer 1-month recovery after mTBI. Research Design: Regression analysis determined which independent variables were most effective in predicting 1-month GOS-E or DRS score. Independent t-test procedures determined whether cognitive recovery varied across APOEe4 carriers. Methods and Procedures: 49 participants admitted to the hospital with mTBI received cognitive evaluation within 48 hours after injury and again one month later. DNA analysis provided participant APOE genotype. Main Outcomes and Results: Results showed that no study variables significantly predicted GOS-E or DRS scores, however, differences were identified when APOE groups were compared. Participants who were noncarriers of APOEe4 had significantly slower reaction times compared to APOEe4 carriers. Participants who were homozygous APOEe4 carriers had significantly lower instances of impulsivity than noncarriers. Conclusion(s): Further research is needed to understand how APOE allele status and performance on initial cognitive testing may influence short-term recovery after mTBI.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2020,/,Brain Injury,34,9,1202-1212,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2020.1795719,2005665910,#20184,Johnson 2020,,yes
Prognostic value of admission serum glucose-phosphate ratio in predicting the 6-month outcome of patients with severe traumatic brain injury: A retrospective study,Qiu S.-Z.; Zheng G.-R.; Chen B.; Huang J.-J.; Shen J.; Mao W. ,"Background: Serum glucose-phosphate ratio has been revealed to be associated with severity and prognosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum glucose-phosphate ratio and severe traumatic brain injury outcome. Method(s): Patients with severe traumatic brain injury were stratified in quartiles according to their serum glucose-phosphate ratio. Outcome parameters included mortality, overall survival and poor outcome defined as Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3 at post-traumatic 6 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between quartiles of serum glucose-phosphate ratio and outcome. Result(s): Data from 105 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Glasgow coma scale score declined, Glasgow outcome scale score decreased, Rotterdam computed tomography classification were raised, mortality increased, overall survival probability reduced and percentage of poor outcome rose significantly with each quartile of serum glucose-phosphate ratio. After adjusting for other confounding factors, serum glucose-phosphate ratio according to quartiles was substantially related to 6-month mortality, overall survival and poor outcome. Under receiver operating characteristic curve, serum glucose-phosphate ratio showed a significantly high prognostic predictive capability.

Comparing Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) in Serum and Plasma Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults,Huebschmann N.A.; Luoto T.M.; Karr J.E.; Berghem K.; Blennow K.; Zetterberg H.; Ashton N.J.; Simren J.; Posti J.P.; Gill J.M.; Iverson G.L. ,"Objective: Identification and validation of blood-based biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is of critical importance. There have been calls for more research on mTBI in older adults. We compared blood-based protein marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations in serum and in plasma within the same cohort of older adults and assessed their ability to discriminate between individuals based on intracranial abnormalities and functional outcome following mTBI. Method(s): A sample of 121 older adults [>=50 years old with head computed tomography (CT), n = 92] seeking medical care for a head injury [Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 14 (n = 6; 5.0%) or 15 (n = 115; 95.0%)] were enrolled from the emergency department (ED). The mean time between injury and blood sampling was 3.4 h (SD = 2.1; range = 0.5-11.7). Serum GFAP concentration was measured first using the Human Neurology 4-Plex Assay, while plasma GFAP concentration was later measured using the GFAP Discovery Kit, both on an HD-1 Single molecule array (Simoa) instrument. Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended was assessed 1 week after injury. Result(s): Both serum and plasma GFAP levels were significantly higher in those with abnormal CT scans compared to those with normal head CT scans (plasma: U = 1,198, p < 0.001; serum: U = 1,253, p < 0.001). The ability to discriminate those with and without intracranial abnormalities was comparable between serum (AUC = 0.814) and plasma (AUC = 0.778). In the total sample, GFAP concentrations were considerably higher in plasma than in serum (Wilcoxon signed-rank test z = 0.42, p < 0.001, r = 0.42). Serum and plasma GFAP levels were highly correlated in the total sample and within all subgroups (Spearman's rho range: 0.826-0.907). Both serum and plasma GFAP levels were significantly higher in those with poor compared to good functional outcome (serum: U = 1,625, p = 0.002; plasma: U = 1,539, p = 0.013). Neither plasma (AUC = 0.653) nor serum (AUC = 0.690) GFAP were adequate predictors of functional outcome 1 week after injury. Conclusion(s): Despite differences in concentration, serum and plasma GFAP levels were highly correlated and had similar discriminability between those with and without intracranial abnormalities on head CT following an mTBI. Neither serum nor plasma GFAP had adequate discriminability to identify patients who would have poor functional outcome.© Copyright © 2020 Huebschmann, Luoto, Karr, Berghem, Blennow, Zetterberg, Ashton, Simren, Posti, Gill and Iverson.",2020,/,Frontiers in Neurology,11,"(Huebschmann, Karr, Iverson) Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States(Huebschmann, Karr, Iverson) Sports Concussion Program, MassGeneral Hospital for Children, Boston, MA, United",1054,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.01054,633010004,#20126,Huebschmann 2020,,yes
Modeling the return to consciousness after severe traumatic brain injury at a large academic level 1 trauma center,Winans N.J.; Liang J.J.; Ashcroft B.; Doyle S.; Fry A.; Fiore S.M.; Mofakham S.; Mikell C.B. ,"OBJECTIVE Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) carries significant morbidity and mortality. It remains difficult to counsel families on functional prognosis and plan research initiatives aimed at treating traumatic coma. In order to better address these problems, the authors set out to develop statistical models using retrospective data to identify admission characteristics that correlate with time until the return of consciousness, defined as the time to follow commands (TFC). These results were then used to create a TFC score, allowing for rapid identification of patients with predicted prolonged TFC. METHODS Data were reviewed and collected from medical records of sTBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor subscores <= 5 who were admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital from January 2011 to July 2018. Data were used to calculate descriptive statistics and build binary logistic regression models to identify admission characteristics that correlated with in-hospital mortality and in-hospital command-following. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify admission characteristics that correlated with the length of TFC. A TFC score was developed using the significant variables identified in the Cox regression model. RESULTS There were 402 adult patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study. The average age was 50.5 years, and 122 (30.3%) patients were women. In-hospital mortality was associated with older age, higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher Rotterdam score (head CT grading system), and the presence of bilateral fixed and dilated pupils (p < 0.01). In-hospital command-following was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil (p < 0.05). TFC was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Additionally, patients who sustained injuries from falls from standing height had a shorter average TFC. The 3 significant variables from the Cox regression model that explained the most variance were used to create a 4-point TFC score. The most significant of these characteristics were Rotterdam head CT scores, high impact traumas, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Importantly, the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil was correlated with longer TFC but no increase in likelihood of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS The creation of the 4-point TFC score will allow clinicians to quickly identify patients with predicted prolonged TFC and estimate the likelihood of command-following at different times after injury. Discussions with family members should take into account the likelihood that patients will return to consciousness and survive after TBI.Copyright ©AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law",2020,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,133,2,477-485,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.2.JNS183568,2007361009,#20117,Winans 2020,,yes
"Correlation between platelet parameters, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, the severity and prognosis of patients with traumatic brain injury",Liu H.; Zhang X. ,"Objective: To investigate the correlation between platelet parameters, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), disease severity and prognosis of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): This retrospective study re-cruited 102 patients with TBI and they were divided into severe group (n=36), moderate group (n=45) and mild group (n=21) according to their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Meanwhile, 23 healthy subjects were selected as the control group. The differences in platelet parameters, PLR, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels among the enrolled subjects on the day of admission were compared, and the correlation between the above indicators and the severity and prognosis of TBI patients was analyzed. Result(s): There were significant differences in blood platelet (PLT) level and PLRs among the four groups (all P<0.05). Compared with the control group, TBI patients had significantly lower PLT level, but significantly higher PLR and serum levels of NSE and hs-CRP (all P<0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that PLT level was positively correlated with GCS score (r=0.586, P<0.05), while PLR, NSE and hs-CRP levels were negatively correlated with GCS score (r=-0.374, P<0.01; r=-0.320, P<0.05; r=-0.705, P<0.05). Multivariate binary logistic regression showed that PLT level was negatively correlated with poor prognosis (OR=0.746, P<0.05), while PLR, NSE, hs-CRP levels were positively correlated with poor prognosis (OR=2.774, 1.840, 1.968, all P<0.05). Conclusion(s): For TBI patients at the early stage, decrease of PLT counts and increased serum levels of PLR, serum NSE and hs-CRP may suggest severe disease condition and poorer prognosis.Copyright © 2020, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The ED Systolic Blood Pressure Relationship After Traumatic Brain Injury,Asmar S.; Chehab M.; Bible L.; Khurrum M.; Castanon L.; Ditillo M.; Joseph B. ,"Background: Blood pressure alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been shown to be associated with increased mortality. However, there is paucity of data describing the optimal emergency department (ED) systolic blood pressure (SBP) target during the initial evaluation. The aim of our study was to assess the association between SBP on presentation and mortality in patients with TBI. Method(s): We performed a retrospective (2015-2016) review of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database and included all adult (age >=18y) trauma patients who had TBI on presentation. The outcome measure was in-hospital mortality at different ED-SBP values. A subanalysis by age and TBI severity in accordance with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was performed (mild (GCS >=13), moderate (GCS 9-12), and severe (<=8)). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Result(s): A total of 94,411 adult trauma patients with TBI were included. Mean age was 59 +/- 21y, 62% were male, and median GCS was 15 [14-15]. Mean SBP was 147 +/- 28 mmHg, and overall mortality was 8.6%. The lowest rate of mortality was noticed at ED SBP between 110 and 149 mmHg, whereas the highest mortality was at admission SBP <90 mmHg and SBP >190 mmHg. On regression analysis, SBP between 130 and 149 mmHg (odds ratio = 0.92; P = 0.68) was not associated with increased odds of mortality relative to SBP between 110 and 129 mmHg. On subanalysis based on severity of TBI (mild 80.9%, moderate 5.3%, and severe 13.8%), patients with SBP between 110 and 149 mmHg were less likely to die across all TBI groups. Conclusion(s): The optimal ED-SBP range for patients with TBI seems to be age and severity dependent. The optimum range might guide clinicians in developing resuscitation protocols for managing patients with TBI.

Assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein as a prognostic marker for neuropsychiatric symptoms and global recovery after traumatic brain injury,Roy D.; Peters M.E.; Everett A.; Leoutsakos J.-M.; Yan H.; Rao V.; Bechtold K.; Sair H.; Van Meter T.; Falk H.; Vassila A.; Hall A.; Ofoche U.; Akbari F.; Diaz-Arrastia R.; Lyketsos C.; Korley F. ,"Background: There are currently no prognostic markers established for predicting the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Objective(s): Based on previous studies identifying prognostic biomarkers implicated in brain injury (1-4), the current analyses focused on detected levels of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) shown to have utility in TBI diagnosis and outcome (3). Method(s): The Head injury Serum Markers for Assessing Response to Trauma (HeadSMART) cohort, a prospective cohort of TBI patients presenting to two urban emergency departments, was examined in this study. GFAP was detected in replicate MSD-ELISA assays in serum obtained within the first 24 hours after injury. Subjects were assessed for neuropsychiatric symptoms at 1, 3 and 6 months postinjury. Result(s): TBI patients (N=503) were enrolled between April 2014, and August 2016. Male patients comprised 59.6% of the samples, 53.9% were Caucasian, 20.9% had abnormal head CT, and 14.9% had GCS scores less than 15. No statistically significant association was found between serum GFAP levels and raw scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Rivermead Post-Concussive Scale, or the Davidson Trauma Scale. There was a statistically significant association between GFAP and total Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended scores at 1 month (beta-0.06, p=0.025), but not at 3 or 6 months (beta-0.026, p=0.432; beta-0.033, p=0.326, respectively). Conclusion(s): This study provides preliminary evidence GFAP can serve as a prognostic marker for functional recovery at 1 month post-TBI.

Altered HPA and ANS activity post-concussion: Characteristics and clinical correlations,Musacchio S.G.; Raff H.; Leddy J.J.; Johnson B.D.; McCrea M.A.; Meier T.B.; Nelson L.D. ,"Background: Concussion (uncomplicated mild traumatic brain injury) is highly prevalent and causes diverse symptoms that impair life function and quality. Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) stress systems may underlie concussion symptoms and recovery. We assessed the course and clinical correlates of two non-invasive markers of the HPA axis and ANS-salivary cortisol (sCORT) and alpha-amylase (sAA), respectively-in a prospectively enrolled sample of patients with concussion. Method(s): Seventeen civilian concussed patients underwent cognitive (arithmetic) and exercise (Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test) stressors in early-mid afternoon 1 week and 1 month post-concussion. Saliva was sampled 10x per exam. Natural log-transformed biomarker levels were evaluated for effects of Sample (1-10) and Visit (1-week, 1-month) and were correlated with concussion symptoms (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom Questionnaire; RPQ). Result(s): Baseline Scort declined significantly from 1-week to 1-month post-mTBI (p.<.0.001). Both sCORT and sAA showed more change in response to exercise at 1-month than 1-week post-injury. Having less change in sCORT and sAA from pre- to post-exercise at 1 week was associated with higher 1-month RPQ symptom burden (r.=.(0.64 and (0.58, respectively, p.<.0.05) Conclusion(s): Findings imply elevated baseline HPA axis activity and reduced HPA and ANS response to exercise 1 week (vs. 1 month) post-concussion; the latter finding is prognostic of poorer symptom recovery. This study provides preliminary data supporting further study of these two stress systems jointly in concussion outcomes.

The Impact of Medical Complications in Predicting the Rehabilitation Outcome of Patients With Disorders of Consciousness After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,Lucca L.F.; Lofaro D.; Leto E.; Ursino M.; Rogano S.; Pileggi A.; Vulcano S.; Conforti D.; Tonin P.; Cerasa A. ,"In this study, we sought to assess the predictors of outcome in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) during neurorehabilitation stay. In total, 96 patients with DOC (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, or emergence from minimally conscious state) were enrolled (69 males; mean age 43.6 +/- 20.8 years) and the improvement of the degree of disability, as assessed by the Disability Rating Scale, was considered the main outcome measure. To define the best predictor, a series of demographical and clinical factors were modeled using a twofold approach: (1) logistic regression to evaluate a possible causal effect among variables; and (2) machine learning algorithms (ML), to define the best predictive model. Univariate analysis demonstrated that disability in DOC patients statistically decreased at the discharge with respect to admission. Genitourinary was the most frequent medical complication (MC) emerging during the neurorehabilitation period. The logistic model revealed that the total amount of MCs is a risk factor for lack of functional improvement. ML discloses that the most important prognostic factors are the respiratory and hepatic complications together with the presence of the upper gastrointestinal comorbidities. Our study provides new evidence on the most adverse short-term factors predicting a functional recovery in DOC patients after severe TBI. The occurrence of medical complications during neurorehabilitation stay should be considered to avoid poor outcomes.© Copyright © 2020 Lucca, Lofaro, Leto, Ursino, Rogano, Pileggi, Vulcano, Conforti, Tonin and Cerasa.",2020,/,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,14,"(Lucca, Leto, Ursino, Rogano, Pileggi, Tonin, Cerasa) S.

Assessment of transient hypaeremic response as an index for cerebral autoregulation in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury using transcranial doppler ultrasound,Zahra M.; Zaytoun T.; Abdalla A.; Beshay B.; Elbeheiry A. ,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been increasing with greater incidence. It remains a leading cause of death (1). Cerebral pressure autoregulation impairment is a well-known pathology after TBI that worsens the prognosis and outcome (2). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can be used to assess Transient Hyperaemic response ratio (THRR) after carotid compression which is a well demonstrated valid index for cerebral autoregulation (3,4). A relative increase in mean flow velocity (MFV) of middle cerebral artery (MCA) above the baseline following the release of carotid compression denotes preserved autoregulation and sequentially predicts good outcome, whereas absence of such response indicates altered autoregulation with poor outcome (5). Objective(s): The aim of the work was to assess cerebral autoregulation and its relation to outcome in patients with moderate and severe TBI using TCD. The primary end point is the Glasgow outcome score (GOS) (6) as a measure of outcome to assess THRR after carotid compression as an indicator of cerebral pressure autoregulation and as a predictor of GOS as well as a being prognostic tool. Other measures of TCD as MFV of MCA and Pulsatility Index (PI) were also used as predictors of GOS and correlated with THRR. The length of stay as well as mortality were recorded and correlated to THRR. Method(s): 120 patients with moderate or severe TBI according to Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) (7) underwent daily TCD, after intial hemodynamic and respiratory stabilization, for 5 days post trauma. All patients were managed according to guidelines for the management of head injury of the American Association of Neurologic Surgeons (8). A compression time of 10 seconds and a compression ratio of 40% or more, allow maximum expression of the hyperaemic response. Also carotid compression is accepted only when flow velocity is stable with no further decrease during the whole period of compression otherwise the compression will be terminated and repeated 60 seconds later (3). The Patients were divided into those with normal TCD measurements and those with poor cerebral circulation (MFV < 40, PI > 1.2). GOS scores are dichotomized into favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Patients in the upper two GOS outcomes groups (good recovery or moderate disability) are considered favorable outcome, and patients in other groups (severe disability, vegetative state or death) are considered unfavorable outcomes. Pearson's correlation coefficiets were calculated to test the relation between TCD and other clinical variables. Discrimination of the logistic models was assessed by calculating the area under (ROC) curve (9). P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): There was a significant correlation between THRR and GOS (patients with THRR >= 1 had favorable outcome). There was also significant correlation between THRR and mortality. Also significant correlation between THRR and MFV as well as PI was found. THRR >= 1 showed sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 72.9%, postive predictive value (PPV) of 82.2% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 74.5% in predicting patients with favorable outcome. Conclusion(s): THRR provides a clinically useful index of cerebral autoregulation. THRR after carotid compression is a good predictor of GOS as well as being a prognostic tool in patients with moderate and severe TBI.

Role of Quantitative EEG and EEG Reactivity in Traumatic Brain Injury,Wang J.; Huang L.; Ma X.; Zhao C.; Liu J.; Xu D. ,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) and EEG reactivity (EEG-R) to predict the prognosis of patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Method(s): This was a prospective observational study on severe traumatic brain injury. Quantitative EEG monitoring was performed for 8 to 12 hours within 14 days of onset. The EEG-R was tested during the monitoring period. We then followed patients for 3 months to determine their level of consciousness. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score was used. The score 3, 4, 5 of GOS were defined good prognosis, and score 1 and 2 as poor prognosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to assess the association of predictors with poor prognosis. Result(s): A total of 56 patients were included in the study. Thirty-two patients (57.1%) awoke (good prognosis) in 3 months after the onset. Twenty-four patients (42.9%) did not awake (poor prognosis), including 11 cases deaths. Univariate analysis showed that Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), the relative band power (RBP), the relative alpha variability (RAV), the spectral entropy (SE), and EEG-R reached significant difference between the poor-prognosis and good-prognosis groups. However, age, gender, and pupillary light reflex did not correlate significantly with poor prognosis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only RAV and EEG-R were significant independent predictors of poor prognosis, and the prognostic model containing these 2 variables yielded a predictive performance with an area under the curve of 0.882. Conclusion(s): Quantitative EEG and EEG-R may be used to assess the prognosis of patients with severe traumatic brain injury early. RAV and EEG-R were the good predictive indicators of poor prognosis.Copyright © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2021.",2021,/,Clinical EEG and Neuroscience,,"(Wang, Liu) Neurosurgery ICU, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China(Huang, Ma, Zhao, Xu) General ICU/Department of Critical Care Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1550059420984934,2010126508,#19980,Wang 2021,,yes

Objective(s): To investigate whether admission levels of eight different protein biomarkers can improve the outcome prediction performance of the Helsinki computed tomography score (HCTS) without clinical covariates in TBI. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-two patients with computed tomography positive TBIs were included in this study. Plasma levels of beta-amyloid isoforms 1-40 (Abeta40) and 1-42 (Abeta42), glial fibrillary acidic protein, heart fatty acid-binding protein, interleukin 10 (IL-10), neurofilament light, S100 calcium-binding protein B, and total tau were measured within 24 h from admission. The patients were divided into favorable (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 5-8, n = 49) and unfavorable (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 1-4, n = 33) groups. The outcome was assessed 6-12 months after injury. An optimal predictive panel was investigated with the sensitivity set at 90-100%. Result(s): The HCTS alone yielded a sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI: 90.9-100) and specificity of 22.4% (95% CI: 10.2-32.7) and partial area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1-4.7), in discriminating patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The threshold to detect a patient with unfavorable outcome was an HCTS > 1. The three best individually performing biomarkers in outcome prediction were Abeta40, Abeta42, and neurofilament light. The optimal panel included IL-10, Abeta40, and the HCTS reaching a partial area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 3.4% (95% CI: 1.7-6.2) with a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 81.8-100) and specificity of 59.2% (95% CI: 40.8-69.4).

Assessment of rotterdam vs marshall ct grading for prognosis of head injury,Jha R.K.; Gupta P.; Dutta G.; Monga R. ,"Trauma is one of the most important issues of most healthcare systems accompanying with head trauma in the most cases. We sought to determine the scoring system and initial Computed Tomography (CT) findings predicting the death at hospital discharge (early death) in patients with traumatic brain injury based on Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores. This is a cross sectional study on traumatic neurosurgical patients with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury admitted to the emergency department of neurosurgery shyam shah medical college,rewa. Patients>=18 years old with TBI during last 24 hours with GCS<=13 were included and exclusion criteria were multiple trauma, penetrating injuries, previous history of anticoagulant therapy, pregnancy, not willingness for participation. Their initial CT and status at hospital discharge, one and three months (dead or alive) were reviewed, and both CT scores were calculated. We examined whether each score is related to death using SPSS11 by The Mann-Whitney U at the level of p<=0.05. Overall, 98 patients were included. Mean age was 43.52+/-21.29. Most patients were male (63.3%). Mean Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores were 3.2+/-1.3 and 2.5+/-1. The mortality at two weeks, one moth and three months were 19.4%, 20.4%, and 20.4%. Rotterdam CT score was significantly different based on type of hematoma. Median GCS score in alive and dead patients on 2 weeks were 10 and 4 (p=0.0001), at one month were 10 and 4 (p=0.0001), and at three months were 10 and 4 (p=0.0001). The median Marshall CT score on 2 weeks were 2 and 4 (p=0.0001), at one month were 2 and 4 (p=0.0001), and at three months were 2 and 4 (p=0.0001). The median Rotterdam CT score on 2 weeks were 2 and 4 (p=0.0001), at one month were 2 and 3 (p=0.001), and at three months were 2 and 3 (p=0.001). The Rotterdam CT score was significantly correlated with mortality at two weeks, one month and three months (p=0.004, p=0.001, and p=0.001, respectively). The Marshall CT score was not significantly correlated with mortality at any time. The Rotterdam CT score was more accurate for prediction of mortality on 2 weeks (ROC80.9), at one month (ROC80.7), and at three months were (ROC80.7) than The Rotterdam CT score (ROC 76, 74.1, and 74.1, respectively).

Abcc8 and TRPM4 genetic variability is associated with intracerebral hemorrhage progression after severe traumatic brain injury,Zusman B.E.; Kochanek P.M.; Puccio A.M.; Okonkwo D.O.; Leach M.; Desai S.M.; Conley Y.P.; Jha R.M. ,"Introduction: Intracerebral hemorrhage progression strongly prognosticates unfavorable outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Sur1-Trpm4 cation-channel is central to this process-possibly an extreme form of vasogenic edema and blood-brain-barrier breakdown. A phase-II trial of Sur1-Trpm4 inhibition in contusion-TBI is ongoing. Research suggests genetic variability influences hemorrhage progression. ABCC8 (Sur1) and TRPM4 genetic variability have previously been associated with TBI edema and/or outcome. Based on known pathophysiology and brain endothelial expression, we hypothesized that ABCC8 and TRPM4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predict TBI hemorrhage progression. Method(s): DNA was extracted from 398 severe-TBI patients. Exomic and non-exomic ABCC8 and TRPM4 SNPs were genotyped (multiplex). Hemorrhage progression at 6, 24, and 120h was quantified. Since craniectomy affects hemorrhage progression, primary analyses excluded these patients. Secondary analyses included all-comers. Multivariable regression analyses evaluated SNP associations with hemorrhage progression. Result(s): 49.3% patients had hemorrhage progression within 120h. 40 SNPs were analyzed. 16 ABCC8 SNPs were associated with hemorrhage progression (p<0.05); five survived multiple comparison corrections. Homozygous variant rs2283261 (OR 4.77, p=0.00097), rs2237982 (OR 3.80, p=0.00046), and rs3819521 (OR 3.92, p=0.009) markedly increased odds of progression within 120h. Rs2283261 was associated with hyperacute (6h, OR 4.15, p=0.007) and acute (24h, OR 4.06, p=0.002) progression. Rs2237982(OR 3.35, p=0.001) and rs8192695 (OR 4.95, p=0.004) were associated with acute progression. Rs916827 (beta=5.92, p=0.009) quantitatively increased 120h progression. Three (rs2283261, rs2237982, rs3819521) have also been associated with TBI edema/outcome, cluster downstream, flank exons encoding the receptor site/juxtapose the channel pore, and are brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Four TRPM4 SNPs (all braineQTLs) were significant. Homozygous wild-type rs3760666 (OR 2.23, p=0.009), rs1477363 (OR 2.32, p=0.008), rs10410857 (OR 2.76, p=0.001), and rs909010 (OR 3.14, p=0.00033) were associated with acute progression. Rs1477363 (OR 2.34, p=0.007), rs10410857 (OR 2.65, p=0.002), and rs909010 (OR 2.90, p=0.00056) increased odds of 120h progression. Rs909010 was associated with 6h progression (OR 2.76, p=0.007). In all-comers, all SNPs were associated with progression (p<0.05), with rs10410857 and rs909010 surviving the multiplicity threshold. Conclusion(s): Five variant ABCC8 SNPs increased odds of hemorrhage progression with large effect sizes; three have previously been associated with TBI edema and/or outcome, increasing plausibility of biological significance.

"Prediction of outcomes in traumatic brain injury: the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic models in a single neurosurgical center, Malaysia",Abdullah J.M.; Idris Z.; Ghani A.R.; Lim M.S. ,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has recently become a major concern for public health care and a socioeconomic burden internationally. Prognostic models are mathematical models developed from specific populations which are used to predict the mortality and unfavourable outcomes especially in trauma centres. Hence, we formulate a study to perform an external validation of the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic models; the CRASH model to predict 14-day mortality and 6-month unfavourable outcome and the IMPACT model to estimate 6-month mortality and unfavourable outcome in a single centre cohort of TBI patients in Malaysia. METHOD(S): All patients with traumatic brain injury (mild, moderate and severe) who were admitted to Hospital Queen Elizabeth from 1st November 2017 to 31st January 2019, were prospectively analysed through a data collection sheet. The discriminatory power of the models was assessed as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test and Cox calibration regression analysis. RESULT(S): We analyzed 281 patients with significant TBI treated in a single neurosurgical center in Malaysia over a 2-year period. The overall observed 14-day mortality was 9.6%, a 6-month unfavourable outcome of 23.5%, and a 6-month mortality of 13.2%. Overall, both the CRASH and IMPACT models showed good discrimination with AUCs ranging from 0.88 to 0.94 and both models calibrating satisfactorily H-L GoF p>0.05 and calibration slopes >1.0 although IMPACT seemed to be slightly more superior compared to the CRASH model.

The diagnosis and prognostic value of plasma copeptin in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Zhang J.; Wang H.; Li Y.; Zhang H.; Liu X.; Zhu L.; Dong L. ,"Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnosis and prognostic value of plasma copeptin levels after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, Google Scholar, VIP, CNKI, and WFSD were systematically searched from the inception dates to May 9, 2020. The pooled analysis of relevant data was conducted by the RevMan 5.3 software. Subgroups analysis was performed to explore the impact of age, country, male ratio, follow-up time, and Glasgow coma score (GCS) on the pooled area under curve (AUC) values of assessment mortality. Result(s): A total of 17 studies involving 2654 participants were included in the current meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that increased plasma copeptin levels were significantly associated with TBI [SMD, 2.44; 95%CI, 1.59 ~ 3.29; P < 0.00001] and also were significantly associated with mortality [SMD, 1.37; 95%CI, 1.16 ~ 1.58; P < 0.00001], and poor functional outcomes (PFO) [SMD, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.20 ~ 1.68; P < 0.00001] in patients with TBI.

The Association between Dual-Task Gait after Concussion and Prolonged Symptom Duration.,"Howell, David R; Brilliant, Anna; Berkstresser, Brant; Wang, Francis; Fraser, Joana; Meehan, William P 3rd","Quantitative gait measurements can identify persistent postconcussion impairments. However, their prognostic utility after injury to identify the likelihood of prolonged concussion symptoms remains unknown. Our objective was to examine if dual-task gait performance measures are independently associated with persistent (> 28 days) concussion symptoms among a sample of athletes. Sixty individuals diagnosed with a sport-related concussion were assessed within 10 days of their injury. Each participant completed a postconcussion symptom scale, an injury history questionnaire, and a single/dual-task gait examination. They were followed until they no longer reported symptoms, and the duration of time required for symptom resolution was calculated. A binary multivariable logistic regression model determined the independent association between dual-task gait and symptom duration (<= 28 days vs. >28 days) while controlling for the effect of gender, age, symptom severity, injury-to-examination time, and history of concussion. Seventeen (28%) participants reported a symptom duration >28 days. The dual-task cost for average gait speed (-25.9 +/- 9.5% vs. -19.8 +/- 8.9%; p = 0.027) and cadence (-18.0 +/- 2.9% vs. -12.0 +/- 7.7%; p = 0.029) was significantly greater among participants who experienced symptoms for >28 days. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, greater dual-task average gait speed costs were independently associated with prolonged symptom duration (aOR = 0.908; 95% CI = 0.835-0.987). Examinations of dual-task gait may provide useful information during multifaceted concussion examinations. Quantitative assessments that simultaneously test multiple domains, such as dual tasks, may be clinically valuable after a concussion to identify those more likely to experience symptoms for >28 days after injury.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,23,3288-3294,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5191,28895490,#6035,Howell 2017,,yes
Serum lipocalin-2 concentrations and mortality of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Shen, Liang-Jun; Zhou, Jing; Guo, Mi; Yang, Chun-Song; Xu, Qi-Chen; Lv, Qing-Wei; Yang, Song-Bin; Huang, Hang-Bin","BACKGROUND: Lipocalin-2 is related to acute brain injury. We assessed the prognostic value of serum lipocalin-2 in head trauma., METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 115 controls and 115 patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Trauma severity was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores at baseline. Thirty-day mortality and overall survival time were recorded., RESULTS: Compared with the controls, serum lipocalin-2 concentrations were significantly increased in the patients. Lipocalin-2 concentrations were independently associated with GCS scores (t=-7.271, P<0.001) and serum C-reactive protein concentrations (t=4.325, P<0.001). Under receiver operating characteristic curve for 30-day mortality, sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 63.2% respectively for lipocalin-2 concentrations at a cutoff value of 591ng/ml. Additionally, area under curve (AUC) of lipocalin-2 concentrations [AUC, 0.825; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.743-0.889] was equivalent to that of GCS scores (AUC, 0.869; 95% CI, 0.793-0.925; P=0.413). Moreover, serum lipocalin-2 concentrations >591ng/ml emerged as an independent predictor for 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 4.360; 95% CI, 1.908-12.430) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 3.820; 95% CI, 1.935-10.500)., CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced serum concentration of lipocalin-2 at admission is associated with trauma severity and neuroinflammation as well as is a predictor of mortality after head trauma.

"Epidemiology, Management, and Functional Outcomes of Traumatic Brain Injury in Sub-Saharan Africa.","Eaton, Jessica; Hanif, Asma Bilal; Grudziak, Joanna; Charles, Anthony","BACKGROUND: Trauma accounts for 4.7 million deaths each year, with an estimated 90% of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Approximately half of trauma-related deaths are caused by central nervous system injury. Because a thorough understanding of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in LMICs is essential to mitigate TBI-related mortality, we established a clinical and radiographic database to characterize TBI in our low-income setting., METHODS: This is a review of prospectively collected data from Kamuzu Central Hospital, a tertiary care center in the capital of Malawi. All patients admitted from October 2016 through May 2017 with a history of head trauma, altered consciousness, and/or radiographic evidence TBI were included. We performed descriptive statistics, a Cox regression analysis, and a survival analysis., RESULTS: There were 280 patients who met inclusion criteria; of these, 80.5% were men. The mean age was 28.8 +/- 16.3 years. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 12 (interquartile range, 8-15). Road traffic crashes constituted the most common injury mechanism (60.7%). There were 148 (52.3%) patients who received a computed tomography scan, with the most common findings being contusions (26.1%). Of the patients, 88 (33.0%) had severe TBI, defined as a GCS score <=8, of whom 27.6% were intubated and 10.3% received tracheostomies. Overall mortality was 30.9%. Of patients who survived, 80.1% made a good recovery. Female sex was protective, and the only significant predictor of poor functional outcome was presence of severe TBI (hazard ratio, 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-4.95)., CONCLUSIONS: TBI represents a significant part of the global neurosurgical burden of disease.

Outcome of traumatic brain injury in patients on antiplatelet agents: a retrospective 20-year observational study in a single neurosurgery unit.,"Sumiyoshi, Kyoko; Hayakawa, Takanori; Yatsushige, Hiroshi; Shigeta, Keigo; Momose, Toshiya; Enomoto, Masaya; Sato, Shin; Takasato, Yoshio","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in patients taking Antiplatelet Agents (APAs)., METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 934 patients with TBI between 1995 and 2014. Multivariate analysis was performed to correlate patient outcome with various factors, including pre-injury APA intake. Cause of death was compared among groups stratified according to APA dose., RESULTS: Increasing doses of APAs were positively associated with mortality rates, however, differences were primarily due to non-traumatic causes. APA therapy before injury was independent of both overall and non-traumatic mortality. In multivariate analysis, mortality was significantly correlated with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), pupillary abnormalities, age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and additional AIS >2. Conversely, non-traumatic mortality was associated with age, GCS, additional AIS >2 and CCI, though only CCI was correlated with increasing APA dose. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed when comparing mortalities according to CCI score among APA groups. Thus, mortalities were associated with the severity of pre-existing conditions rather than APA dose., CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of patients with TBI, who were on APAs may be determined by the severity of pre-existing conditions.

"Forensic and clinical significance of serum amylase, lipase and gamma glutamyl transferase as predictors of outcome in head injured patients.","Abo El-Noor, Mona Mohamed; ElHosary, Naema Mahmoud; Elatrozy, Hytham Ibrahim; Abou Elgheit, Hussein Mohamed; Elbelkasy, Ahmed Mohamed; Fath, Ahmed Gamal; El-Shafy, Ghada Hamed","Head trauma is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Combined head lesions consist of more than one form of lesions. Biochemical markers of brain injury are used in determining the extent of brain injury and predicting its outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the forensic and clinical significance of serum amylase, lipase and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) as predictors of the outcome in head injured patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty head injured patients were enrolled and subjected to personal history taking, general and local physical examination. Glasgow coma scale (GCS), head computed tomography scan and pelvi-abdominal ultrasound were performed. Two blood samples (each 3 mL) were drawn at the time of admission and after 24 h for measuring serum amylase, lipase and GGT levels using special kits., RESULTS: Most cases of head trauma occurred accidentally during daytime, in the street as a result of falls and road traffic accidents (RTA). Significant increase of serum amylase, lipase and GGT levels on re-evaluation after 24 h from admission were demonstrated in combined head lesions. There was a high significant negative correlation between GCS and these enzymes both on admission and 24 h after admission. Serum levels of measured enzymes were significantly higher in non-survivors as compared to survivors., CONCLUSION: Serum amylase, lipase and GGT are good predictors of the outcome in head injured patients. This could be useful for forensic experts to deduce that the poor outcome of the victims was primarily related to the effects of head trauma and its sequences.

Early detection of consciousness in patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury.,"Edlow, Brian L; Chatelle, Camille; Spencer, Camille A; Chu, Catherine J; Bodien, Yelena G; O'Connor, Kathryn L; Hirschberg, Ronald E; Hochberg, Leigh R; Giacino, Joseph T; Rosenthal, Eric S; Wu, Ona","See Schiff (doi:10.1093/awx209) for a scientific commentary on this article. Patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury may recover consciousness before self-expression. Without behavioural evidence of consciousness at the bedside, clinicians may render an inaccurate prognosis, increasing the likelihood of withholding life-sustaining therapies or denying rehabilitative services. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography techniques have revealed covert consciousness in the chronic setting, but these techniques have not been tested in the intensive care unit. We prospectively enrolled 16 patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute severe traumatic brain injury to test two hypotheses: (i) in patients who lack behavioural evidence of language expression and comprehension, functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography detect command-following during a motor imagery task (i.e. cognitive motor dissociation) and association cortex responses during language and music stimuli (i.e. higher-order cortex motor dissociation); and (ii) early responses to these paradigms are associated with better 6-month outcomes on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on post-injury Day 9.2 +/- 5.0 and electroencephalography on Day 9.8 +/- 4.6. At the time of imaging, behavioural evaluation with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised indicated coma (n = 2), vegetative state (n = 3), minimally conscious state without language (n = 3), minimally conscious state with language (n = 4) or post-traumatic confusional state (n = 4). Cognitive motor dissociation was identified in four patients, including three whose behavioural diagnosis suggested a vegetative state. Higher-order cortex motor dissociation was identified in two additional patients. Complete absence of responses to language, music and motor imagery was only observed in coma patients. In patients with behavioural evidence of language function, responses to language and music were more frequently observed than responses to motor imagery (62.5-80% versus 33.3-42.9%). Similarly, in 16 matched healthy subjects, responses to language and music were more frequently observed than responses to motor imagery (87.5-100% versus 68.8-75.0%). Except for one patient who died in the intensive care unit, all patients with cognitive motor dissociation and higher-order cortex motor dissociation recovered beyond a confusional state by 6 months. However, 6-month outcomes were not associated with early functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography responses for the entire cohort. These observations suggest that functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography can detect command-following and higher-order cortical function in patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury. Early detection of covert consciousness and cortical responses in the intensive care unit could alter time-sensitive decisions about withholding life-sustaining therapies.

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) may be the primary pathologic feature of MTBI but is normally not detectable by conventional imaging technology. This lack of sensitivity of clinical imaging techniques has impeded a pathophysiologic understanding of the long-term cognitive and emotional consequences of MTBI, which often remain unnoticed and are attributed to factors other than the injury. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural properties of brain tissue and has been suggested to be a promising candidate for the detection of DAI in vivo. In this study, we report strong associations between brain white matter DTI and self-reported cognitive, somatic and emotional symptoms at 12 months post-injury in 134 MTBI patients. The anatomical distribution suggested global associations, in line with the diffuse symptomatology, although the strongest effects were found in frontal regions including the genu of the corpus callosum and the forceps minor. These findings support the hypothesis that DTI may provide increased sensitivity to the diffuse pathophysiology of MTBI and suggest an important role of advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in trauma care.",2017,/,Scientific reports,7,1,13795,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-13628-1,29061970,#6010,Hellstrom 2017,,yes
Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury: Clinical Characteristics and a Prognostic Model of 12-Month Outcome.,"Einarsen, Cathrine Elisabeth; van der Naalt, Joukje; Jacobs, Bram; Follestad, Turid; Moen, Kent Goran; Vik, Anne; Haberg, Asta Kristine; Skandsen, Toril","BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) often are studied together with patients with severe TBI, even though the expected outcome of the former is better. Therefore, we aimed to describe patient characteristics and 12-month outcomes, and to develop a prognostic model based on admission data, specifically for patients with moderate TBI., METHODS: Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 9-13 and age >=16 years were prospectively enrolled in 2 level I trauma centers in Europe. Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score was assessed at 12 months. A prognostic model predicting moderate disability or worse (GOSE score <=6), as opposed to a good recovery, was fitted by penalized regression. Model performance was evaluated by area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curves., RESULTS: Of the 395 enrolled patients, 81% had intracranial lesions on head computed tomography, and 71% were admitted to an intensive care unit. At 12 months, 44% were moderately disabled or worse (GOSE score <=6), whereas 8% were severely disabled and 6% died (GOSE score <=4). Older age, lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, no day-of-injury alcohol intoxication, presence of a subdural hematoma, occurrence of hypoxia and/or hypotension, and preinjury disability were significant predictors of GOSE score <=6 (area under the curve = 0.80)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate TBI exhibit characteristics of significant brain injury. Although few patients died or experienced severe disability, 44% did not experience good recovery, indicating that follow-up is needed. The model is a first step in development of prognostic models for moderate TBI that are valid across centers. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sarcopenia Measured Using Masseter Area Predicts Early Mortality following Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Hu, Parker; Uhlich, Rindi; White, Jared; Kerby, Jeffrey; Bosarge, Patrick","Sarcopenia is strongly associated with poor outcomes and mortality following injury among the geriatric population. Diagnosis using psoas area is most common but may be unavailable given limited radiographic evaluation following low-impact injuries. Masseter area has recently been identified as an available alternative and associated with 2-year mortality following injury. We sought to validate this measure and its association with early mortality following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) using a retrospective analysis of all geriatric trauma patients with sTBI admitted from 2011-2016 to our trauma center. Admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <=8 was used to identify sTBI. Bilateral masseter area was measured 2 cm below the zygomatic arch and the mean used for analysis. Sarcopenia was defined as mean masseter area one standard deviation or less from the sex-based mean. Multivariate models with logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards test followed univariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and evaluated by log rank. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. A total of 108 patients were identified for inclusion. Twenty-five patients, 16 male and nine female, had sarcopenia with mean masseter areas of 2.81 +/- 0.45 cm2 and 2.24 +/- 0.42 cm2, respectively. Patients with sarcopenia had significantly increased rates of 30-day mortality (80.0% vs. 50.6%; p = 0.01).

Outcomes after Traumatic Brain Injury with Concomitant Severe Extracranial Injuries.,"Watanabe, Tomoo; Kawai, Yasuyuki; Iwamura, Asami; Maegawa, Naoki; Fukushima, Hidetada; Okuchi, Kazuo","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in trauma patients. Patients with TBI frequently sustain concomitant injuries in extracranial regions. The effect of severe extracranial injury (SEI) on the outcome of TBI is controversial. For 8 years, we retrospectively enrolled 485 patients with the blunt head injury with head abbreviated injury scale (AIS)  3. SEI was defined as AIS  3 injuries in the face, chest, abdomen, and pelvis/extremities. Vital signs and coagulation parameter values were also extracted from the database. Total patients were dichotomized into isolated TBI (n = 343) and TBI associated with SEI (n = 142). The differences in severity and outcome between these two groups were analyzed. To assess the relation between outcome and any variables showing significant differences in univariate analysis, we included the parameters in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Mortality was 17.8% in the isolated TBI group and 21.8% in TBI with SEI group (P = 0.38), but the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in the TBI with SEI group was unfavorable compared to the isolated TBI group (P = 0.002). Patients with SBP  90 mmHg were frequent in the TBI with SEI group. Adjusting for age, GCS, and length of hospital stay, SEI was a strong prognostic factor for mortality with adjusted ORs of 2.30.

Understanding the association between intracranial contusions and outcome may aid in MTBI treatment and prognosis., METHODS: MTBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15 and 6-month outcomes [Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)], without polytrauma from the prospective TRACK-TBI Pilot study were analyzed. Intracranial contusions on computed tomography (CT) were coded by location. Multivariable regression evaluated associations between intracranial injury type (temporal contusion [TC], frontal contusion, extraaxial [epidural/subdural/subarachnoid], other-intraaxial [intracerebral/intraventricular hemorrhage, axonal injury]) and GOSE. Odds ratios (OR) are reported., RESULTS: Overall, 260 MTBI subjects were aged 44.4 +/- 18.1-years; 67.7% were male. Ninety-seven subjects were CT-positive and 46 had contusions (41.3%-frontal, 30.4%-temporal, 21.7%-frontal + temporal, 2.2% each-parietal/occipital/brainstem); 95.7% had concurrent extraaxial hemorrhage. Mortality was 0% at discharge and 2.3% by 6-months. GOSE distribution was 2.3%-death, 1.5%-severe disability, 27.7%-moderate disability, 68.5%-good recovery. Forty-six percent of TC-positive subjects suffered moderate disability or worse (GOSE <=6) and 41.7% were unable to return to baseline work capacity (RTBWC), compared to 29.1%/20.4% for CT-negative and 26.1%/20.9% for CT-positive subjects without TC. On multivariable regression, TC associated with OR = 3.33 (95% CI [1.16-9.60], p = 0.026) for GOSE <=6, and OR = 4.48 ([1.49-13.51], p = 0.008) for inability to RTBWC., CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal contusions in MTBI are often accompanied by extraaxial hemorrhage.

We discerned the relationship between serum soluble ST2 (sST2) concentrations, inflammation, severity and prognosis following traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: We measured serum sST2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, myelin basic protein, glial fibrillary astrocyte protein, S100B, neuron-specific enolase, phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H, Tau and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 concentrations in 106 healthy controls and 106 severe TBI patients. We recorded long-term prognosis (i.e., 6-month mortality and functional outcome) and in-hospital major adverse events, including in-hospital mortality, acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction., RESULTS: sST2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in controls and were significantly correlated with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score and the preceding biomarkers concentrations. Serum sST2 was an independent prognostic predictor and its predictive ability significantly exceeded those of serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein concentrations and was similar to those of GCS scores and serum concentrations of other remaining biomarkers. Moreover, sST2 concentrations significantly improved predictive ability of GCS score., CONCLUSION: Increased serum sST2 concentrations are significantly related to inflammation, severity and prognosis, substantialized ST2 as a potential prognostic biomarker for TBI.

Research Design:  Retrospective study design, using data collected from 2010 to 2017. Methods and Procedures: Data from 41 cases obtained from a private medicolegal neuropsychological database was examined. The database comprised information pertaining to TBI etiology, TBI severity parameters, demographic variables, neuropsychological test results and scores on psychological questionnaires. PTA duration was examined as a continuous variable. All cases that demonstrated non-credible effort were excluded. Main Outcomes and Results:  Continuous PTA duration was not found to be a significant predictor of cognitive impairment across domains of verbal intellect, non-verbal intellect, working memory, information processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory, and executive functioning. Conclusions: The predictive relationship between duration of PTA and cognitive impairment that has been reported in non-litigating populations did not exist in a litigating TBI sample. Findings illustrate the importance of investigating the relationships between injury variables and cognitive outcome in a population undergoing litigation, to provide better understanding of outcome in this subgroup of patients with TBI.",2019,/,Brain injury,33,8,1087-1096,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2019.1610797,31046471,#5183,Chen 2019,,maybe
Quantitative pupillometry for the monitoring of intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Jahns, Fritz-Patrick; Miroz, John Paul; Messerer, Mahmoud; Daniel, Roy T; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Eckert, Philippe; Oddo, Mauro","BACKGROUND: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is frequent after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may cause abnormal pupillary reactivity, which in turn is associated with a worse prognosis. Using automated infrared pupillometry, we examined the relationship between the Neurological Pupil index (NPi) and invasive ICP in patients with severe TBI., METHODS: This was an observational cohort of consecutive subjects with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 9 with abnormal lesions on head CT) who underwent parenchymal ICP monitoring and repeated NPi assessment with the NPi-200 R pupillometer. We examined NPi trends over time (four consecutive measurements over intervals of 6 h) prior to sustained elevated ICP > 20 mmHg. We further analyzed the relationship of cumulative abnormal NPi burden (%NPi values < 3 during total ICP monitoring time) with intracranial hypertension (ICHT)-categorized as refractory (ICHT-r; requiring surgical decompression) vs. non-refractory (ICHT-nr; responsive to medical therapy)-and with the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS)., RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were studied (mean age 54 +/- 21 years, 74% with focal injuries on CT), of whom 32 (59%) had ICHT. Among subjects with ICHT, episodes of sustained elevated ICP (n = 43, 172 matched ICP-NPi samples; baseline ICP [T- 6 h] 14 +/- 5 mmHg vs. ICPmax [T0 h] 30 +/- 9 mmHg) were associated with a concomitant decrease of the NPi (baseline 4.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.6, p < 0.0001 ANOVA for repeated measures). Abnormal NPi values were more frequent in patients with ICHT-r (n = 17; 38 [3-96]% of monitored time vs. 1 [0-9]% in patients with ICHT-nr [n = 15] and 0.5 [0-10]% in those without ICHT [n = 22]; p = 0.007) and were associated with an unfavorable 6-month outcome (15 [1-80]% in GOS 1-3 vs. 0 [0-7]% in GOS 4-5 patients; p = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: In a selected cohort of severe TBI patients with abnormal head CT lesions and predominantly focal cerebral injury, elevated ICP episodes correlated with a concomitant decrease of NPi.

Characteristics of patients with VAP vs characteristics of patients without VAP were compared, and outcome was assessed at 6 months after injury by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: The study included 962 patients: 196 (20.4%) developed a VAP at a median interval of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3-7 days) after intubation. Patients who developed VAP were younger (median age, 39.5 [IQR, 25-55] years vs 51 [IQR, 30-66] years; P < .001), with a higher incidence of alcohol abuse (36.6% vs 27.6%; P = .026) and drug abuse (10.1% vs 4.2%; P = .009), more frequent thoracic trauma (53% vs 43%; P = .014), and more episodes of respiratory failure during ICU stay (69.9% vs 28.1%; P < .001). Age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99; P = .001), chest trauma (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90; P = .033), histamine-receptor antagonist intake (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.37-3.39; P = .001), and antibiotic prophylaxis (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.96; P = .026) were associated with the risk of VAP.

Using trauma registry data to predict prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with traumatic brain injury: Machine learning approach.,"Abujaber, Ahmad; Fadlalla, Adam; Gammoh, Diala; Abdelrahman, Husham; Mollazehi, Monira; El-Menyar, Ayman","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to build a machine learning predictive model to predict the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) for patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)., METHODS: This study included TBI patients who were hospitalized in a level 1 trauma center between January 2014 and February 2019. Data were analyzed for all adult patients who received mechanical ventilation following TBI with abbreviated injury severity (AIS) score for the head region of >= 3. This study designed three sets of machine learning models: set A defined PMV to be greater than 7 days, set B (PMV > 10 days) and set C (PMV >14 days) to determine the optimal model for deployment. Patients' demographics, injury characteristics and CT findings were used as predictors. Logistic regression (LR), Artificial neural networks (ANN) Support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and C.5 Decision Tree (C.5 DT) were used to predict the PMV., RESULTS: The number of eligible patients that were included in the study were 674, 643 and 622 patients in sets A, B and C respectively.

Heterogeneity in Temporal Ordering of Depression and Participation After Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Rabinowitz, Amanda R; Chervoneva, Inna; Hart, Tessa; O'Neil-Pirozzi, Therese M; Juengst, Shannon B; Hoffman, Jeanne M","OBJECTIVE: To examine heterogeneity in the temporal patterns of depression and participation over the first 2 years post traumatic brain injury (TBI)., DESIGN: Observational prospective longitudinal study., SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation centers, with 1- and 2-year follow-up conducted primarily by telephone., PARTICIPANTS: Persons with TBI (N=2307) enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems database, followed at 1 and 2 years post injury., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Participation Assessment With Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O)., RESULTS: Using latent class modeling we examined heterogeneity in the longitudinal relationship between PHQ-9 and PART-O. The identified 6 classes were most distinct in terms of (1) level of PHQ-9 score and (2) association between the year 1 PART-O score and year 2 PHQ-9 score. For most participants, PART-O at year 1 predicted PHQ-9 at year 2 more than the reverse. However, there was a subgroup of participants that demonstrated the reverse pattern, PHQ-9 predicting later PART-O, who were on average, older and in the ""other"" employment category., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that links between participation and depression are stronger for some people living with TBI than for others and that variation in the temporal sequencing of these 2 constructs is associated with demographic characteristics. These findings illustrate the value in accounting for population heterogeneity when evaluating temporal among outcome domains. Copyright © 2020 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Cognitive-communication difficulties following traumatic brain injury sustained in older adulthood: a scoping review.,"Shorland, Joanna; Douglas, Jacinta; O'Halloran, Robyn","BACKGROUND: Older adults are a peak incidence group for traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, empirical evidence on TBI in older adults is often limited to extrapolated findings from studies involving younger adults. While cognitive-communication deficits are an established consequence of TBI with substantial impact on social outcome for younger adults, little is known about the nature of cognitive-communication changes experienced by older adults following a new-onset TBI. In order to inform evidence-based service delivery and support older adults who sustain TBI, it is important to understand how these difficulties manifest in older adults., AIMS: To review the empirical literature to determine the nature and breadth of research that has addressed the influence of older age on cognitive-communication outcomes following TBI sustained in older adulthood., METHODS & PROCEDURES: A scoping review framework was used. Five electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus) were searched to locate peer-reviewed studies addressing cognitive-communication following TBI sustained at >= 55 years. Given the absence of dedicated investigations within the search yield, studies were included where at least 30% of participants were aged >= 55 years at injury, and age was a stated focus of the investigation., OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 2468 unique records were identified and reduced to 225 after title and abstract screening. Full-text review revealed only three studies that met the criteria. Collectively these studies included adults aged 55-93 years at injury. Two studies focused on age as a predictor for acute cognitive-communication difficulty, and one on the impact of age on facial emotion recognition in the chronic stages of injury. None of the studies had a dedicated focus on cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who sustained a TBI within the defined period of older adulthood., CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This scoping review produced limited results and insufficient evidence to inform rehabilitation for older adults. Indeed, very little is known about cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who sustain a TBI. This review highlights the need, in the context of an ageing population, for research within this area to be prioritized. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Empirical evidence to support the management of post-TBI cognitive-communication difficulties in adults predominantly stems from studies with young adults. However, the broader TBI literature suggests that outcome for older adults requires specific consideration due to its distinct nature and occurrence during a stage of life when there is the potential for subtle change to the processes of cognition and communication as part of typical ageing. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This scoping review identifies that research related to cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who have sustained a TBI is very much in its infancy. Overarching statements about post-TBI cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults cannot be drawn, nor can it be determined if outcomes for older adults differ from younger adults. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The lack of research in this area means that tangible guidance cannot be provided to clinicians working with older adults following TBI to support evidence-based practice for cognitive-communication. This scoping review strongly supports the need for further research in this area.

Prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients on mechanical ventilation post traumatic brain injury: machine learning approach.,"Abujaber, Ahmad; Fadlalla, Adam; Gammoh, Diala; Abdelrahman, Husham; Mollazehi, Monira; El-Menyar, Ayman","BACKGROUND: The study aimed to introduce a machine learning model that predicts in-hospital mortality in patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all adult patients who sustained TBI and were hospitalized at the trauma center from January 2014 to February 2019 with an abbreviated injury severity score for head region (HAIS) >= 3. We used the demographic characteristics, injuries and CT findings as predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and Artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to predict the in-hospital mortality. Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), precision, negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity and F-score were used to compare the models` performance., RESULTS: Across the study duration; 785 patients met the inclusion criteria (581 survived and 204 deceased). The two models (LR and ANN) achieved good performance with an accuracy over 80% and AUROC over 87%. However, when taking the other performance measures into account, LR achieved higher overall performance than the ANN with an accuracy and AUROC of 87% and 90.5%, respectively compared to 80.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, severity of TBI as measured by abbreviated injury score, TBI diagnosis, the need for blood transfusion, heart rate upon admission to the emergency room and patient age were found to be the significant predictors of in-hospital mortality for TBI patients on MV., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning based LR achieved good predictive performance for the prognosis in mechanically ventilated TBI patients.

Permanent post concussion symptoms after mild head injury: A systematic review of age and gender factors,King N. ,"Background: Older age and female gender are known factors in the development of persisting post concussion symptoms (PCS) following mild head injury (MHI). Very few studies however have examined these variables in permanent PCS. Objective(s): This systematic review empirically examines the extent to which such factors pertain to this group. Method(s): Systematic electronic data base searches identified all long-term studies of two types: first, those with correlations between age or gender and outcome; second, those providing the mean ages or gender mixes of samples selected for poor outcome and samples not selected for such. Result(s): Twenty studies from 1341 abstracts were ultimately analysed. Correlation studies showed poorer outcome to be associated with both older age (3/4 studies) and female gender (2/4 studies). Those with poor long-term outcome had a significantly higher mean age (40.6) than non-selected patients (32.5). The proportion of men in selected samples (54.8%) was significantly lower than those in non-selected ones (66.5%). Conclusion(s): Older age is a strong vulnerability factor in the development of permanent PCS and female gender is a significant one. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",2014,/,NeuroRehabilitation,34,4,741-748,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/NRE-141072,373391489,#23190,King 2014,,maybe
Clinical analysis on risk factors and prognosis of early post-traumatic epilepsy.,"Liu, Zaiming; Chen, Qianxue; Chen, Zhibiao; Wang, Junmin; Tian, Daofeng; Wang, Long; Liu, Baohui; Zhang, Shenqi","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors and prognosis related to early post-traumatic epilepsy (EPTE)., METHODS: One hundred and eighty-six patients with traumatic brain injury were enrolled. Their full clinical data were collected. Single factor analysis and logistic regression analysis of risk factors related to EPTE were performed. The prognosis of patients was determined., RESULTS: Single factor analysis showed that there were significant differences of age (p = 0.011), epilepsy history (p < 0.001), injury site (p = 0.004), injury type (p < 0.001) and injury degree (p < 0.001) between the EPTE group (40 patients) and non-EPTE group (146 patients). Logistic regression analysis showed that the injury site, injury type and injury degree were the main risk factors for EPTE. The odds ratio values of injury site, injury type and injury degree were 1.977 (1.473-2.679), 2.096 (1.543-2.842) and 2.376 (1.864-3.609), respectively.

A retrospective study of the effect of fibrinogen levels during fresh frozen plasma transfusion in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Nakae, Ryuta; Yokobori, Shoji; Takayama, Yasuhiro; Kanaya, Takahiro; Fujiki, Yu; Igarashi, Yutaka; Suzuki, Go; Naoe, Yasutaka; Fuse, Akira; Yokota, Hiroyuki","BACKGROUND: The association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and coagulopathy is well established. While coagulopathy prophylaxis in TBI involves replenishing coagulation factors with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), its effectiveness is controversial. We investigated the relationship between plasma fibrinogen concentration 3 h after initiating FFP transfusion and outcomes and evaluated the correlation with D-dimer levels at admission., METHODS: We retrospectively examined data from 380 patients with severe isolated TBI with blood samples collected a maximum of 1 h following injury. Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations were obtained at admission, and plasma fibrinogen concentration was again assessed 3-4 h following injury. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received FFP transfusion. Patients were also divided into subgroups according their fibrinogen level: >= 150 mg/dL (high-fibrinogen subgroup) or < 150 mg/dL (low-fibrinogen subgroup) 3 h after injury. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data were compared between these subgroups., RESULTS: Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at discharge and 3 months after injury were significantly lower in the FFP transfusion group than in the FFP non-transfusion group. Among patients who received FFP, GOS scores at discharge and 3 months after injury were significantly higher in the high-fibrinogen subgroup than in the low-fibrinogen subgroup. Elevated admission D-dimer predicted subsequent fibrinogen decrease., CONCLUSIONS: In FFP transfusion, fibrinogen level >= 150 mg/dL 3 h after injury was associated with better outcomes in TBI patients.

Early Prognostication after Traumatic Brain Injury: Specific Validation of the IMPACT Prognostic Calculator in a Level 1 Trauma Center.,"Jung, Anna; Arlt, Felix; Rosolowski, Maciej; Meixensberger, Jurgen","The present study evaluated the usefulness of the IMPACT prognostic calculator (IPC) for patients receiving acute neurointensive care at a level 1 trauma center in Germany. A total of 139 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were assessed. One day after trauma, the extended model of the IPC was found to provide the most valid prediction of 6-month mortality/unfavorable outcome. Different time frames within the first day could be determined by analyzing mild, moderate, and severe TBI cohorts. The CORE + CT model at time frame Z2 (<6 h from the point of first documentation) for mild TBI exhibited the highest values in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (area under the curve [AUC], 0.9; sensitivity, 1; specificity, 0.7). For patients with moderate head injury at time frame Z2/3 (<6-12 h from point of first documentation), the extended model fit best. For patients with severe TBI, the extended model at time frame Z6 (48-72 h from point of first documentation) best predicted 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome (ROC analysis: AUC, 0.542/0.445; sensitivity, 0.167/0.364; specificity, 0.575/0.444). Center-specific validation demonstrated the validity of the IPC in the early phase after TBI. These findings support the usefulness of the IPC for predicting the prognosis of patients with TBI.

This study aimed to externally validate three international prediction models using JNTDB data: Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH), and International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT). We also aimed to validate the applicability of these models in the Japanese population. Of 1,091 patients registered in the JNTDB from July 2009 to June 2011, we analyzed data for 635 patients. We examined factors associated with mortality in-hospital and unfavorable outcomes 6 months after TBI by applying the TRISS, CRASH, and IMPACT models. We also conducted an external validation of these models based on these data. The patients' mean age was 60.1 +/-21.1 years, and 342 were alive at the time of discharge (53.9%). Univariate analysis revealed eight major risk factors for mortality in-hospital: age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, mydriasis, acute epidural hematoma (AEDH), and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A similar analysis identified five risk factors for unfavorable outcomes at 6 months: age, GCS, ISS, mydriasis, and AEDH. For mortality in-hospital, the TRISS had a satisfactory area under the curve value (0.75).

Identification of clinical characteristics and factors predicting favorable treatment outcomes in elderly patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Choi, Mi Sun; Jeong, Donghwan; You, Namkyu; Roh, Tae Hoon; Kim, Se-Hyuk","Age is an important prognostic factor for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and worse treatment outcomes have been reported in elderly patients. Therefore, proper treatment is needed for the increasing number of elderly patients with TBI. We aimed to analyze predictive factors of favorable treatment outcomes (FTO) in elderly patients. Clinical and radiological data from 493 patients with TBI who visited a single institute were retrospectively collected from January 2014 to December 2015. We compared the characteristics of the elderly group (individuals above 65years) and younger group (16-65years). We analyzed the characteristics and outcomes in both groups and the factors related to the Glasgow outcome scale-extended score at 6months after injury in 170 elderly patients. The treatment outcomes were dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable groups. In the elderly group, the proportion of female patients and the incidence of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) were higher than in the younger group. Among the 170 elderly patients, 62 had pure SDH, and 21 of the 62 with pure SDH had undergone surgical treatment. Compared with other types of intracranial hemorrhage, FTO was as high as 85.5%, and mortality was as low as 11.3% in patients with pure SDH. High initial Glasgow coma scale score, low injury severity score, and normal pupillary reflex were significantly related to FTO in multivariate analysis. Therefore, active therapeutic strategies, including surgery should be considered for elderly patients with pure SDH without intra-parenchymal injury. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We attempted to determine relationship between serum TK levels and trauma severity in addition to clinical outcome in TBI., METHODS: We recruited 112 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow coma scale score<9) and 112 controls. We configured 2 multivariate models to assess the relationship between serum TK levels and 30-day death. Its prognostic predictive ability was analyzed under receiver operating characteristic curve., RESULTS: TK levels were significantly lower in patients than in controls (median 0.148mg/l, the upper - lower quartiles 0.121-0.185 vs. median 0.258mg/l, the upper - lower quartiles 0.207-0.342, P<0.001). TK levels were closely and positively correlated with Glasgow coma scale score (r=0.550). TK levels <0.148mg/l independently predicted 30-day mortality with odds ratio value of 4.752 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.166-19.367) and 30-day overall survival with hazard ratio value of 3.698 (95% CI, 1.026-13.333). TK levels significantly discriminated 30-day mortality with area under curve of 0.822 (95% CI, 0.738-0.887)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum TK can represent a potential predictor of clinical outcome in TBI patients.

Bio-Shock Index: Proposal and Rationale for a New Predictive Tool for In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.,"El-Menyar, Ayman; Asim, Mohammad; Ramzee, Ahmed Faidh; Nabir, Syed; Ahmed, Mohamed Nadeem; Al-Thani, Abdulaziz; Al-Abdulmalek, Abdulrahman; Al-Thani, Hassan","BACKGROUND: We proposed a novel prognostic tool for the prediction of in-hospital mortality based on a combination of hemodynamic parameters and biomarkers in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that a combination of shock index (SI) with high sensitive troponin T (HsTnT), the Bio-Shock Index (Bio-SI), has better prognostic power than its individual components., METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted (2011-2018) for patients with TBI. Patients were categorized into 2 groups (low and high Bio-SI) based on the receiver operating characteristic curve., RESULTS: A total of 2619 patients were admitted with TBI, and 1471 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 73% had high Bio-SI (>=10). High Bio-SI values were associated with more intraventricular hemorrhage (P = 0.001), brain edema (P = 0.001), and had lower mean arterial pressure (P = 0.001), admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (P = 0.001), and higher SI (P = 0.001), serum lactate (P = 0.001), HsTnT values (P = 0.001), and Rotterdam score (P = 0.03). Patients with high Bio-SI had a prolonged hospital (P = 0.003) and intensive care unit stay (P = 0.001); longer ventilatory days (P = 0.001) and had higher rates of pneumonia (P = 0.001), sepsis (P = 0.001), and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.001). The Bio-SI showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value (91.4% and 94.4%, respectively) as compared with elevated SI (50.2% and 87.6%, respectively) and positive troponin (79.7% and 93.7%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The Bio-SI is potentially a better tool than its individual components to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with TBI; however, HsTnT alone outperforms SI. Prospective studies and multicenter trials studying troponin levels and SI in all patients with TBI with the inclusion of outcome scores will prove or disprove the predictability of the new index.

Feasibility of Hidden Markov Models for the Description of Time-Varying Physiologic State After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Asgari, Shadnaz; Adams, Hadie; Kasprowicz, Magdalena; Czosnyka, Marek; Smielewski, Peter; Ercole, Ari","OBJECTIVES: Continuous assessment of physiology after traumatic brain injury is essential to prevent secondary brain insults. The present work aims at the development of a method for detecting physiologic states associated with the outcome from time-series physiologic measurements using a hidden Markov model., DESIGN: Unsupervised clustering of hourly values of intracranial pressure/cerebral perfusion pressure, the compensatory reserve index, and autoregulation status was attempted using a hidden Markov model. A ternary state variable was learned to classify the patient's physiologic state at any point in time into three categories (""good,"" ""intermediate,"" or ""poor"") and determined the physiologic parameters associated with each state., SETTING: The proposed hidden Markov model was trained and applied on a large dataset (28,939 hr of data) using a stratified 20-fold cross-validation., PATIENTS: The data were collected from 379 traumatic brain injury patients admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge between 2002 and 2016., INTERVENTIONS: Retrospective observational analysis., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Unsupervised training of the hidden Markov model yielded states characterized by intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, compensatory reserve index, and autoregulation status that were physiologically plausible. The resulting classifier retained a dose-dependent prognostic ability. Dynamic analysis suggested that the hidden Markov model was stable over short periods of time consistent with typical timescales for traumatic brain injury pathogenesis., CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first application of unsupervised learning to multidimensional time-series traumatic brain injury physiology. We demonstrated that clustering using a hidden Markov model can reduce a complex set of physiologic variables to a simple sequence of clinically plausible time-sensitive physiologic states while retaining prognostic information in a dose-dependent manner. Such states may provide a more natural and parsimonious basis for triggering intervention decisions.",2019,/,Critical care medicine,47,11,e880-e885,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000003966,31517697,#5050,Asgari 2019,,yes

Research Design: Five hundred and ten patients (mean age: 40.4 years) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Methods and Procedures: Patients were provided MAT for one to several years in the eight medical facilities of the National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victims' Aid (NASVA) in Japan. Clinical status for consciousness, communication, and activities of daily living were evaluated using the NASVA grading system. Outcomes and results: Following MAT, NASVA scores at discharge were significantly improved compared to those at admission in every patient subgroup including sex, age, NASVA score, and association with/without hypoxic encephalopathy at admission. Younger age, shorter interval between injury and admission, and better neurocognitive function at admission were found to be significant and independent factors for a good prognosis. Conclusions: MAT can partially improve the cognitive and physical abilities of patients with chronic DOC.

"Long-Term Follow-Up of Disability, Cognitive, and Emotional Impairments after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.","Stalnacke, Britt-Marie; Saveman, Britt-Inger; Stenberg, Maud","Aim: To assess the clinical course of disability, cognitive, and emotional impairments in patients with severe TBI (s-TBI) from 3 months to up to 7 years post trauma., Methods: A prospective cohort study of s-TBI in northern Sweden was conducted. Patients aged 18-65 years with acute Glasgow Coma Scale 3-8 were assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS) at 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years after the injury., Results: The scores on both GOSE and BNIS improved significantly from 3 months (GOSE mean: 4.4 +/- 2.3, BNIS mean: 31.5 +/- 7.0) to 1 year (GOSE mean: 5.5 +/- 2.7, p = 0.003, BNIS mean: 33.2 +/- 6.3, p = 0.04), but no significant improvement was found from 1 year to 7 years (GOSE mean: 4.7 +/- 2.8, p = 0.13, BNIS mean: 33.5 +/- 3.9, p = 0.424) after the injury. The BNIS subscale ""speech/language"" at 1 year was significantly associated with favourable outcomes on the GOSE at 7 years (OR = 2.115, CI: 1.004-4.456, p = 0.049)., Conclusions: These findings indicate that disability and cognition seem to improve over time after s-TBI and appear to be relatively stable from 1 year to 7 years. Since cognitive function on some of the BNIS subscales was associated with outcome on the GOSE, these results indicate that both screening and follow-up of cognitive function could be of importance for the rehabilitation of persons with s-TBI.",2019,/,Behavioural neurology,2019,8914585,9216931,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/9216931,31534558,#5040,Stalnacke 2019,,yes
[The prognostic value of mri-classification of traumatic brain lesions level and localization depending on neuroimaging timing].,"Zakharova, N E; Danilov, G V; Potapov, A A; Pronin, I N; Alexandrova, E V; Kravchuk, A D; Oshorov, A V; Sychev, A A; Polupan, A A; Savin, I A","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification of traumatic brain lesion localization and levels in patients with a brain injury of various severity in a few days to three weeks after the injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cohort of 278 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of various severity aged 8-74 y.o. (average -31.4+/-13.8, median - 29 (21.3; 37.0) was included in the analysis. The severity of TBI at admission varied from 3 to 15 Glasgow coma scores (GCS) (average - 8+/-4, median - 7 (5; 12). The main indications and conditions for MRI were: inconsistency between computed tomography (CT) data and neurological status, the necessity to clarify the location and type of brain damage, the absence of metal implants, the stabilization of the patient's vital functions, etc. MRI was performed during the first three weeks after the injury using T1, T2, T2-FLAIR, DWI, T2*GRE, SWAN sequences. The damage to the brain was classified according to 8 grades depending on the lesion levels (cortical-subcortical level, corpus callosum, basal ganglia and/or thalamus, and/or internal, and/or external capsules, uni- or bilateral brain stem injury at a different level). Outcomes were assessed by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) 6 months after injury., RESULTS: The significant correlations were found for the entire cohort between MRI grading and TBI severity (by GCS) and outcome (by GOS) of the injury (R=-0.66; p<0.0001; R=-0.69; p<0.0001, respectively). A high accuracy (77%), sensitivity (77%) and specificity (76%) of the proposed MRI classification in predicting injury outcomes (AUC=0.85) were confirmed using the logistic regression and ROC analysis. The assessment of MRI-classification prognostic value in subgroups of patients examined during the first, second, and third weeks after injury showed significant correlations between the GCS and the GOS as well as between MRI-grading and GCS, and GOS in all three subgroups. In the subgroup of patients examined during the first 14 days after the injury, the correlation coefficients were higher compared with those obtained in a subgroup examined 15-21 days after the injury. The highest correlations between MRI grading, TBI severity, and the outcome were found in the subgroup of patients who underwent MRI in the first three days after the injury (n=58)., CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI classification of traumatic brain lesion levels and localization based on the use of different MR sequences reliably correlated with the clinical estimate of TBI severity by GCS and the outcomes by GOS in patients examined during the first three weeks after injury.

Traumatic microbleeds suggest vascular injury and predict disability in traumatic brain injury.,"Griffin, Allison D; Turtzo, L Christine; Parikh, Gunjan Y; Tolpygo, Alexander; Lodato, Zachary; Moses, Anita D; Nair, Govind; Perl, Daniel P; Edwards, Nancy A; Dardzinski, Bernard J; Armstrong, Regina C; Ray-Chaudhury, Abhik; Mitra, Partha P; Latour, Lawrence L","Traumatic microbleeds are small foci of hypointensity seen on T2*-weighted MRI in patients following head trauma that have previously been considered a marker of axonal injury. The linear appearance and location of some traumatic microbleeds suggests a vascular origin. The aims of this study were to: (i) identify and characterize traumatic microbleeds in patients with acute traumatic brain injury; (ii) determine whether appearance of traumatic microbleeds predict clinical outcome; and (iii) describe the pathology underlying traumatic microbleeds in an index patient. Patients presenting to the emergency department following acute head trauma who received a head CT were enrolled within 48 h of injury and received a research MRI. Disability was defined using Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended <=6 at follow-up. All magnetic resonance images were interpreted prospectively and were used for subsequent analysis of traumatic microbleeds. Lesions on T2* MRI were stratified based on 'linear' streak-like or 'punctate' petechial-appearing traumatic microbleeds. The brain of an enrolled subject imaged acutely was procured following death for evaluation of traumatic microbleeds using MRI targeted pathology methods. Of the 439 patients enrolled over 78 months, 31% (134/439) had evidence of punctate and/or linear traumatic microbleeds on MRI. Severity of injury, mechanism of injury, and CT findings were associated with traumatic microbleeds on MRI. The presence of traumatic microbleeds was an independent predictor of disability (P < 0.05; odds ratio = 2.5). No differences were found between patients with punctate versus linear appearing microbleeds. Post-mortem imaging and histology revealed traumatic microbleed co-localization with iron-laden macrophages, predominately seen in perivascular space. Evidence of axonal injury was not observed in co-localized histopathological sections. Traumatic microbleeds were prevalent in the population studied and predictive of worse outcome. The source of traumatic microbleed signal on MRI appeared to be iron-laden macrophages in the perivascular space tracking a network of injured vessels. While axonal injury in association with traumatic microbleeds cannot be excluded, recognizing traumatic microbleeds as a form of traumatic vascular injury may aid in identifying patients who could benefit from new therapies targeting the injured vasculature and secondary injury to parenchyma.

Comorbidity in adults with traumatic brain injury and all-cause mortality: a systematic review.,"Xiong, Chen; Hanafy, Sara; Chan, Vincy; Hu, Zheng Jing; Sutton, Mitchell; Escobar, Michael; Colantonio, Angela; Mollayeva, Tatyana","OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been recognised to alter the clinical course of patients and influence short-term and long-term outcomes. We synthesised the evidence on the effects of different comorbid conditions on early and late mortality post-TBI in order to (1) examine the relationship between comorbid condition(s) and all-cause mortality in TBI and (2) determine the influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with a TBI at baseline on all-cause mortality., DESIGN: Systematic review., DATA SOURCES: Medline, Central, Embase, PsycINFO and bibliographies of identified articles were searched from May 1997 to January 2019., ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Included studies met the following criteria: (1) focused on comorbidity as it related to our outcome of interest in adults (ie, >=18 years of age) diagnosed with a TBI; (2) comorbidity was detected by any means excluding self-report; (3) reported the proportion of participants without comorbidity and (4) followed participants for any period of time., DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Data were synthesised through tabulation and qualitative description., RESULTS: A total of 27 cohort studies were included. Among the wide range of individual comorbid conditions studied, only low blood pressure was a consistent predictors of post-TBI mortality. Other consistent predictors were traditional sociodemographic risk factors. Higher comorbidity scale, scores and the number of comorbid conditions were not consistently associated with post-TBI mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Given the high number of comorbid conditions that were examined by the single studies, research is required to further substantiate the evidence and address conflicting findings.

We performed an observational multicenter study including adult TBI patients that were monitored for intracranial pressure (ICP) for at least 24 h in three ICUs. We used machine learning-based logistic regression modeling to create two algorithms (based on ICP, mean arterial pressure [MAP], cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP] and Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) to predict 30-day mortality. We used a stratified cross-validation technique for internal validation. Of 472 included patients, 92 patients (19%) died within 30 days. Following cross-validation, the ICP-MAP-CPP algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased from 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.74) on day 1 to 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.87) on day 5.

Algorithm misclassification was seen among patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy. In conclusion, we present a new concept of dynamic prognostication for patients with TBI treated in the ICU.

All therapeutic interventions in TBI and their timeliness and efficacy depend on timely and quality diagnosis of patient's condition, including laboratory parameters of blood and urine. The aim: To assess for peculiar patterns in changes of NO gas transmitter levels in patients with severe traumatic brain injury during the treatment period and to investigate into its relationship with nuclease enzymes in the context of various treatment outcomes., Material and methods: This research work has used clinical data, history and diagnostic tests obtained in 72 patients with severe traumatic brain injury, age 18 to 76 years (mean age 42.26+/-15.02 years), who six months later have been divided into the following four groups according to Glasgow outcome scale: ""Death"", ""Severe disability"", ""Moderate disability"" and ""Recovery""., Results: Biochemical assessments in patients with severe traumatic brain injury have shown supranormal levels of urinary nitric oxide and serum DNAses. Going forward, nitric oxide levels significantly decreased over the time of treatment in subjects with favorable outcomes (""Moderate disability"" and ""Recovery"" groups) and increased with treatment time in subjects with unfavorable outcomes (""Severe disability"" and ""Death"" groups).

Prognostication of neurocognitive and functional outcomes after traumatic brain injury using the Glasgow Coma Score,Carroll E.; Manktelow A.; Outtrim J.; Sahakian B.; Newcombe V.; Menon D. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A clear understanding of the relation between acute clinical presentation and chronic neurocognitive and functional deficits is important in order to build better predictive models. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) quantifies the neurological state of TBI patients by assessing verbal, motor and eye-opening responses. TBI patients are often stratified in terms of injury severity using GCS in research, but its prognostic accuracy is debated. We explored the predictive value of GCS in cognitive, physical, social and emotional outcome six months after TBI. TBI patients (n = 138; 40% female; GCS 3-15) aged 17 to 70 years completed a battery of cognitive and questionnaire measures six months after injury. Age and education matched orthopaedic trauma patients (n = 25) and healthy volunteers (n = 99) acted as controls. A clear dichotomy in the functional and cognitive measures that were predicted by GCS was observed, as reflected by the strength GCS correlation and the pattern of group differences. GCS predicted functional outcome in physical and social domains (disability, physical functioning, social functioning) but not in emotional domains (depression, well-being, subjective general health, subjective bodily pain). GCS also predicated outcome in the majority of cognitive domains (verbal fluency, episodic memory, learning, visual and spatial short-term recognition memory, sustained attention) but with the clear exception of working memory (WM; WM span, maintenance and manipulation of information in WM, attentional flexibility). We also observed a strong dissociation in six month outcome between mild and severe TBI cases (according to GCS) in the absence of dissociation between moderate TBI cases and other groups. These findings suggest that the stratification of TBI patients according to GCS for research purposes could be limited to mild and severe (and not moderate) cases. Although GCS may be useful for identifying TBI patients that could benefit from cognitive and occupational rehabilitation, the use of prognostic factors other than GCS are necessary to identify patients requiring early intervention for the prevention of emotional difficulties.",2017,/,Brain and Neuroscience Advances,1,"(Carroll, Manktelow, Outtrim, Newcombe, Menon) Division of Anaesthesia, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom(Sahakian) Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom",208-209,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2398212817705279,625686071,#22000,Carroll 2017,,yes
The risk of deterioration in CT identified mild traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Marincowitz C.; Lecky F.; Townend W.; Borakati A.; Sheldon T. ,"Background The optimal management of minor head injured patients with brain injury identified by CT imaging is unclear. Some guidelines recommend routine hospital admission of GCS13-15 patients with traumatic brain (TBI) injury identified by CT imaging. Others argue that selected lower-risk patients can be discharged from the Emergency Department (ED). Objective To estimate the risk of death, neurosurgery and clinical deterioration minor head injured patients with TBI identified by CT imaging, and assess which factors affect the risk of these outcomes. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis adhering to PRISMA standards of reporting. Four electronic data bases and a range of additional literature were searched using a highly sensitive search strategy. Study selection was performed by 2 independent reviewers. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was undertaken to estimate pooled risks of: clinical deterioration, neurosurgery and death. Meta-regression was used to explore between study variation in outcome estimates using study characteristics. Factors assessed by individual studies as affecting the outcomes of interest were recorded and pooled within study risk factor effects were estimated where possible. Results 4431 studies were identified by the search strategy, of which 123 studies were fully retrieved and 49 primary studies and 5 reviews met the inclusion criteria. The estimated pooled risk of the outcomes of interest were: clinical deterioration 11.7% (95% CI:11.7 to 15.8; neurosurgery 3.5% (95% CI:2.2% to 4.9%); death 1.4% (95% CI:0.8% to 2.2%). A large degree of between study variation in the estimates of the outcomes was identified. Multivariable meta-regression of study characteristics identified that mean age of the study population and mean initial GCS accounted for up to half of the variation in reported study outcomes. Within studies the following factors were found to affect the risk for these adverse outcomes: age; severity of injury; type of injury; initial GCS; anti-coagulation; anti-platelet medication; and injury severity scoring. When univariable within study risk factor effect estimates were pooled patients with isolated subarachnoid haemorrhage had an odds ratio of 0.19 for deterioration compared to other injury types. Conclusion Minor head injured patients with brain injury identified by CT imaging have a clinically important risk of serious adverse outcomes. Research has identified the possible factors that affect this risk. However, these factors need to be incorporated into a validated multivariable prognostic model before low-risk patients can be reliably identified clinically and triaged to lower levels of care.

Early detection of poor outcome after mild traumatic brain injury: Predictive factors using a multidimensional approach a pilot study,Caplain S.; Blancho S.; Marque S.; Montreuil M.; Aghakhani N. ,"Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a common condition within the general population, usually with good clinical outcome. However, in 10-25% of cases, a post-concussive syndrome (PCS) occurs. Identifying early prognostic factors for the development of PCS can ensure widespread clinical and economic benefits. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential value of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to identify early prognostic factors following MTBI. We performed a multi-center open, prospective, longitudinal study that included 72 MTBI patients and 42 healthy volunteers matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. MTBI patients were evaluated 8-21 days after injury, and 6 months thereafter, with a full neurological and psychological examination and brain MRI. At 6 months follow-up, MTBI patients were categorized into two subgroups according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as having either favorable or unfavorable evolution (UE), corresponding to the presence of major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury. Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analysis demonstrated the importance of patient complaints, quality of life, and cognition in the outcome of MTBI patients, but only 6/23 UE patients were detected early via the multivariate logistic regression model. Using several variables from each of these three categories of variables, we built a model that assigns a score to each patient presuming the possibility of UE. Statistical analyses showed this last model to be reliable and sensitive, allowing early identification of patients at risk of developing PCS with 95.7% sensitivity and 77.6% specificity.Copyright © 2017 Caplain, Blancho, Marque, Montreuil and Aghakhani.",2017,/,Frontiers in Neurology,8,DEC,666,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2017.00666,619614879,#21961,Caplain 2017,,yes
Level of platelet distribution width and outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury,Zhang B.; Gu J.; Qiu Y.; Zhao J.; Song Y.; Jiang H.; Ding A.; Chen X.; Yu R.; Liu G.; Hu A. ,"Background: This study examines the clinical utility of the level of increased platelet distribution width (PDW) as a predictor of outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 120 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were recruited. Age, gender, PDW, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were measured. These patients were divided into two groups based on their 30-day outcomes. Receiver operating curves (ROCs) were generated to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. Result(s): One hundred twenty patients with traumatic brain injury were enrolled in this study, 89 males (74.2%) and 31 females (25.8%) with a median age of 49.5 (19 - 89) years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 10.8% (n = 13). PDW levels in non-surviving patients were higher than in surviving patients. The higher the PDW, the lower the GSC score. The area under the curve (AUC) for PDW levels with regard to predicting 30-day mortality was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78 to 0.97; p < 0.001). There was correlation between PDW level and GCS score (r = -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.46 to - 0.13; p < 0.001).

Lesions in deep gray nuclei after severe traumatic brain injury predict neurologic outcome,Clarencon F.; Bardinet E.; Martinerie J.; Pelbarg V.; Menjot de Champfleur N.; Gupta R.; Tollard E.; Soto-Ares G.; Ibarrola D.; Schmitt E.; Tourdias T.; Degos V.; Yelnik J.; Dormont D.; Puybasset L.; Galanaud D. ,"Purpose: This study evaluates the correlation between injuries to deep gray matter nuclei, as quanti-tated by lesions in these nuclei on MR T2 Fast Spin Echo (T2 FSE) images, with 6-month neurological outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials and methods: Ninety-five patients (80 males, mean age = 36.7y) with severe TBI were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a MR scan within the 45 days after the trauma that included a T2 FSE acquisition. A 3D deformable atlas of the deep gray matter was registered to this sequence; deep gray matter lesions (DGML) were evaluated using a semi-quantitative classification scheme. The 6-month outcome was dichotomized into unfavorable (death, vegetative or minimally conscious state) or favorable (minimal or no neurologic deficit) outcome. Result(s): Sixty-six percent of the patients (63/95) had both satisfactory registration of the 3D atlas on T2 FSE and available clinical follow-up. Patients without DGML had an 89% chance (P = 0.0016) of favorable outcome while those with bilateral DGML had an 80% risk of unfavorable outcome (P = 0.00008). Multivariate analysis based on DGML accurately classified patients with unfavorable neurological outcome in 90.5% of the cases. Conclusion(s): Lesions in deep gray matter nuclei may predict long-term outcome after severe TBI with high sensitivity and specificity.Copyright © 2017 Clarencon et al.

Predicting mortality in traumatic brain injury: Comparison of red cell distribution width and crash,Sadaka F.; Pearson T.; Doctors N.; Snyders B.; O'Brien J. ,"Learning Objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Red cell distribution (RDW) is an expression of the variation in size of the red blood cells. RDW is reflective of inflammation. It is a predictor of mortality in the general critically ill population. The role of RDW as a prognostic biomarker for ICU mortality in TBI patients is unknown. Based on the CRASH trial database, a prognosis calculator (CRASH) has been developed and validated for the mortality prediction in patients with TBI. CRASH incorporates age, GCS, pupils' reactivity to light, findings on head CT scan, and presence of major extracranial injury in its calculations. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between RDW on day 1 of TBI and ICU mortality, and to compare outcome prediction from RDW to that from CRASH. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients with TBI and a GCS score of 14 or less between 1/2013 and 9/2016. Day 1 RDW and CRASH data were extracted. CRASH was calculated for each patient. Student t tests were used to compare means. The C statistic was calculated as a measure of the overall strength of prediction for both RDW and CRASH. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the mortality predictions from RDW on day 1 and CRASH. Result(s): A total of 416 patients with TBI were included, with 339 survivors (S) and 77 nonsurvivors (NS); ICU mortality rate of 18.5%. Compared to survivors, nonsurvivors were of similar age in years (58 +/- 23 vs 58 +/- 23, p = 1.0), had lower GCS scores (5 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 3, p = 0.0001), similar RDW (14.0 +/- 1.2 vs 13.9 +/- 1.5, p = 0.6), and lower CRASH values (68 +/- 26 vs 24 +/- 22, p = 0.0001). Estimating the ROC area under the curve (AUC) showed that CRASH was a significantly better predictor of ICU mortality compared to RDW (AUC = 0.91 +/- 0.01 for CRASH compared to 0.66 +/- 0.03 for RDW (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): CRASH calculator was a strong predictor of ICU mortality in patients with TBI.

Intracranial pressure trajectories: A novel tool to inform severe TBI phenotypes,Jha R.; Elmer J.; Zusman B.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.; Shutter L.; Wallisch J.; Conley Y.; Kochanek P. ,"Learning Objectives: ICP is dynamic and influenced by genetics, TBI injury complex and medical treatments. Existing studies use point intracranial-pressure measures for patient categorization. Critical information about clinically important temporal trends is thus potentially lost. ABCC8, encoding sulfonylurea-receptor-1 is a putative regulator of cerebral edema in TBI and other neurological diseases. We aimed to 1) define ICP trajectories over time in patients with severe TBI, 2) determine whether ABCC8 polymorphisms associated with edema differed across ICP trajectory groups (ICP-TGs) and 3) whether ICP-TG predicted clinical outcome. Method(s): We included prospective observational data from 446 severe TBI patients (GCS< 8, 2001-2014) from a single center. Trajectories were modeled from hourly ICP measurements (hours 1-120 after ventriculostomy/monitor placement). We used Group Based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) incorporating clinically relevant time-invariant risk factor adjustment (age, sex, initial GCS score, emergent craniectomy, primary hemorrhage pattern). We employed censored-normal distributions and Bayesian Information Criteria to select best models. We compared 6-month outcomes and tag-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2237982, rs7105832) across ICP-TGs. Result(s): A 6-trajectory-group model best fit the data. ICP-TGs 1 (8.42%) and 2 (21.78%) had older patients (48.64 +/- 2.98; 47.72 +/- 1.84 years) with consistently low ICPs. ICP-TGs 5 (14.85%) and 6 (3.22%) contained younger patients (32.15 +/- 1.91; 39.38 +/- 4.17 years) with persistently high ICPs.

Prognostic value of hyperchloremia in patients with traumatic brain injury: A prospective observational study,Sarah T.; Ali J.; Mahmoud M.; Nesrine C.; Yosra R.; Salma G.; Mohamed H. ,"Introduction: Background-Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a major public health problem. They are the leading cause of death among those aged less than 40 years. Hyperchloremia is a common electrolyte disturbance in patients with TBI. Hyperchloremia has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients + however, its prognostic significance in TBI patients is poorly documented. The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and outcomes of hyperchloremia in patients with TBI admitted to the intensive care unit. Patients and Methods: In a prospective design, we included 43 consecutive patients with TBI (37 males + median age-52 years) admitted to the ICU in Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from Mars to September 2017. Adult patients (aged >= 18 years) with isolated TBI or associated with minor extra-cranial injuries (defined as all non-head Abbreviated Injury Scale < 3) were included. Hyperchloremia was defined as a chloride level > 110mEg/l. Clinical and laboratory variables were compared between survivors (n = 36) and non-survivors (n = 7). We assessed the association between hyperchloremia 24-h post-admission and 30-day mortality. p < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): The median SOFA score at T0 was 7 points and the median IGS 2 score was 32 points. The median ISS was 25 points. There were 11 cases of mild head injury, 12 moderate head injury and 20 severe head injury. The 30-day mortality was 16%. Hyperchloremia occurred in 15 patients (35%) and the incidence was significantly different between survivors and non-survivors (28 vs. 72%, respectively, p < 0.001). In addition to hyperchloremia (p = 0.018), other laboratory variables were associated with 30-day mortality-hypernatremia (p = 0.011) and hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Hyperchloremia 24-h post-admission was associated with 30-day mortality in patients with TBI. This index could be useful prognostic marker.

We compared 6-month disability, mortality, and relevant ABCC8 tag-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2237982, rs7105832) across ICPtrajectory groups. Result(s): A six trajectory-group model best fit the data, identifying subcohorts that differed in initial ICP, ICPevolution/ longitudinal trajectory, and number of ICP spikes >20 mmHg. There were pattern differences in age, hemorrhage pattern, and craniectomy rates between groups.

Bringing evidence-based decision support to traumatic brain injury outcomes in Tanzania,Vissoci J.R.N.; Rocha T.; Elahi C.; Haglund M.; Staton C.A. ,"Background: Prognostic models to support clinical decisions is an innovative solution to mitigate the increasing burden of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in low and medium income countries (LMIC). Hospitals, equipped with predictive models, can make data driven decisions based on patient prognosis to improve efficiency, productivity and outcomes. The breadth of prognostic model development has ignored resource poor countries. Furthermore, attempts to implement TBI predictive models are limited in both high and LMIC. The main objective of this study was to develop a predictive model for TBI outcomes as a first step toward implementation at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. Methods; Our study is categorized as retrospective, with diagnostic temporal perspective, using the classification approach. Data comprising 3138 patients admitted with TBI were collected from 2014 to 2017. Data about demographics, injury type, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Score, surgeries and outcome observed were analyzed for each patient. Our model considered the good recovery obtained through the Glasgow outcome score extended scale as a result measure. Data were analyzed using Bayesian Generalized Linear Model. Result(s): The average age of patients were 31.18 and 82.02% were men. Of all TBI patients 67.87% were victims of road traffic injury. Considering the good recovery as outcome our model achieved an accuracy of 0.865 (95% CI 0.859, 0.870), with a sensitivity level of 0.890 and specificity of 0.713. our detection rate of a good recovery due TBI interventions based on admission data were of 0.762. The main predictors of a good recovery were: Glasgow coma level score, pulse oximetry, availability of intensive care unit bed. Conclusion(s): A predictive model with modest performance can be generated from data available at patient admission in a low resource setting such as Tanzania, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre hospital. An increase in the volume of data gathered, comprising different scenarios, can potentially augment the precision of the proposed model.

CT evidence of brainstem hemorrhage does not lead to worsened long term outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury,Puffer R.; Puffer R.C.; Weiner G.; Mesley M.; Okonkwo D. ,"Introduction: Patients with severe traumatic brain injury presenting with evidence of brainstem hemorrhage on admission CT are thought to have a more devastating neurologic injury compared to patients without brainstem hemorrhage. We sought to determine if traumatic brainstem hemorrhage affects long term outcome in patients with severe TBI. Method(s): The brain trauma research center at the University of Pittsburgh medical center has maintained a prospective database of patients with severe traumatic brain injury, and we retrospectively searched this database between 1991 to 2007. We identified patients with admission CT scans as well as long term outcomes using the Glasgow outcome scale and disability rating scale. Long term outcomes were compared between patients with and without evidence of traumatic brainstem hemorrhage on admission CT. Result(s): We identified 678 patients, and of those, 494 had adequate CT scan data and long term follow-up completed. The mean age of the cohort was 37.2 (+/-0.79 years), and 28/494 (6%) had evidence of brainstem hemorrhage on admission CT.

"Continuous EEG after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: Seizures, ictal-interictal patterns and neurophysiologic predictors of functional outcome",Lee H.; Mizrahi M.; Hartings J.; Moseley B.; Privitera M.; Foreman B. ,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury is common and the leading source of disability in the US. International guidelines for the use of EEG in those requiring ICU admission include indications to detect nonconvulsive seizures in those with altered mental status or in those at high-risk, although evidence is lacking for which patients might be at risk. Further, there is no evidence for the prognostic importance of continuous EEG (cEEG) in the context of established clinical indicators. Method(s): We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the INTREPD2566 study (NCT00805818), a randomized controlled clinical trial of NNZ-2566, a synthetic neurotrophic IGF-1 derivative for moderate to severe TBI, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 4-12. This study failed to achieve its secondary end-point of modifying EEG. Per protocol, all patients received study drug or placebo within 8 h of injury; cEEG was initiated as soon as possible and continued for 72 h. Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended data were collected at 3 months and dichotomized as good (GOSE 5-8) or poor (GOSE 1-4). Result(s): A total n = 261 were initially enrolled; n = 38 were subsequently excluded from the study and n = 141/222 (63.5%) underwent cEEG monitoring. The mean age was 34 +/- 15 years and 127/141 (90.1%) were men. The median post-resuscitation GCS was 7 (Interquartile Range 6-8) with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 23.6 +/- 13.3. Mortality was 8.5% (12/141) at 3 months. The mean time from trauma to cEEG was 13.8 +/- 9.8 h. Of those with data at 72 h, n = 24/120 (20%) had electrographic seizures, lateralized periodic discharges, or lateralized rhythmic discharges (SZ/LD); 4/120 had seizures alone. Only the presence of mass lesion on CT was associated with SZ/LD (OR 4.0, 95 CI 0.05-0.58; p = 0.01). Although n = 3/4 patients with seizures had poor outcome, there was no statistical association with outcome (OR2.9, 95 CI 0.22-154.60; NS); similarly, SZ/LD were observed equally between those with good and poor outcome. By contrast, the presence of a posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients were associated with good outcome, while background delta frequencies were associated with poor outcome; superimposed background alpha/beta and burst-suppression (usually associated with sedation) were not associated with outcome. On multivariate analysis, only the ISS (OR 1.05, 95 CI 1.02-1.09) and an absence of sleep transients within 24 h (OR 4.61, 95 CI 2.14- 9.94) were independently associated with poor outcome; the odds for poor outcome increased to 6.19 (95 CI 2.54-15.07) at 72 h without sleep transients. Conclusion(s): In this prospective cohort, we confirmed the incidence of seizures and focal periodic or rhythmic discharges and found an association with mass lesions on initial imaging.

Simplifying the use of prognostic information in traumatic brain injury,Murray D.; Brennan M.; Teasdale G.M. ,"Objectives: Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), pupil reactivity, age and CT findings are related to outcome of TBI. Nevertheless, predictive models have not found a role in clinical practice. We developed a method of displaying probabilities graphically that is simple to use. Method(s): GCS, pupil response, age, CT findings, late outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale and mortality, were obtained from CRASH and IMPACT patients. GCS and pupil response were combined into the GCS and Pupils Score (GCS-P). The combined associations were modelled with logistic regression. Result(s): Age and GCS-P have an additive effect on outcome. The probability of mortality 6 months after TBI is greater with increasing age. For all age groups probability of death is greater with decreasing GCS-P. Conversely, probability of favourable recovery decreases with increasing age and with reducing GCS-P. Charts were produced displaying outcome probabilities for age and GCS. CT scan findings showed similar outcome differences with/without a haematoma, or absent cisterns, or subarachnoid haemorrhage and further prognostic charts were developed, stratifying by: none/only one/two or more CT abnormalities. Conclusion(s): Prognostic features in TBI can be combined to display graphically their effects on mortality risk or prospect for independent recovery.

Organ dysfunction in critical care is a more important outcome predictor than age across all severities of tbi,Zador Z.; Cusimano M.D. ,"Background: Age is the main parameter of decision-making for treatment, prediction and trial design as endorsed by multiple studies.

Models assessed the role of age, gender, Glasgow Coma Score, morbidity count, imaging findings, and severe extracranial injury. Organ dysfunction was derived from components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to cover respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and coagulation systems. Outcome predictions and importance ranking were carried out using logistic regression, Random Forest (RF), Nagelkerke R2 and receiveroperating curve (ROC) indices. Probabilistic associations between variables were assessed using Bayesian networks (BN) an unsupervised/ partially supervised technique in machine learning. Result(s): Organ dysfunction was by far the most influential predictor of mortality outranking age. Without organ dysfunction there was a significant drop in model accuracy as area under ROC (AUC) decreased from 0.76 (CI95% 0.73-0.79) to 0.69 (CI95% 0.66-0.72, DeLong p < 0.005). This was corroborated by importance ranking using RF and Nagelkerke R2. Excluding age did not alter model performance (AUC = 0.72, De- Long's p = 0.07). BN analysis revealed multiple intuitive relations such the influence of GCS of 8 or below on mortality rate. It also showed morbidity burden (i.e number of diseases per patient) was the only variable directly associated with organ dysfunction. Conclusion(s): With increasing clinical heterogeneity, age is no longer the most important prognosticator for patients with TBI in critical care. Organ dysfunction (directly influenced by multimorbidity burden) is the most important predictor of clinical outcome. While our study is limited to critical care, incorporation of mulitmorbidity and organ dysfunction in predictions/clinical trial design seems essential.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,16,A100,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.29013.abstracts,623884035,#21629,Zador 2018,,yes
Temporal lobe contusions are associated with impaired six-month functional recovery after mild TBI: A track-TBI study,Yue J.K.; Runyon S.J.; Winkler E.A.; Taylor S.R.; Morrissey M.R.; Deng H.; Rivera E.J.; Vassar M.J.; Lingsma H.F.; Cnossen M.C.; Yuh E.L.; Mukherjee P.; Schnyer D.M.; Puccio A.M.; Valadka A.B.; Okonkwo D.O.; Manley G.T. ,"Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) constitutes nearly 80% of all TBI and can result in persistent functional deficits and significant societal costs. Intracerebral contusions often cause permanent parenchymal injury, and evaluating contusion characteristics as risk factors for poor outcomes may aid in treatment and prognosis. MTBI patients aged >=18- years with emergency department arrival Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15 who completed six-month functional outcomes [Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)] were extracted from the prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot study. To focus on isolated MTBI, patients with polytrauma (extracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale score >=3) or who underwent a neurosurgical procedure/surgery were excluded. Intracranial contusions on arrival head CT were coded by location. For patients alive at sixmonths, associations between contusion location (frontal, temporal) and GOSE were evaluated using multivariable regressions controlling for demographic/injury history, extraaxial hemorrhage (epidural/subdural/ subarachnoid) and other intraaxial pathology (intracerebral/ intraventricular hemorrhage, axonal injury). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs are reported. Overall, 260 MTBI patients were aged 44.4+/-18.1-years, 67.7%-male, and 78.1%-Caucasian. Education was 14.1+/-3.0-years, 21.2%-baseline unemployed, 34.2%-baseline psychiatric disorder. Mechanisms were fall-50.8%, motor-vehicleaccident- 18.4%, pedestrian-vs.-auto-10.8%, assault-15.8%, and other- 4.2%. Intracranial injury was present in 37.3% of patients (n = 97; 14.6%-extraaxial-only, 16.5%-contusion+extraaxial, 0.8%- contusion-only, 0.4%-contusion+extraaxial+other intraaxial, 3.1%- other intraaxial-only, 1.9%-extraaxial+other intraaxial). of the 17.7% (n = 46) with contusions, 41.3% were frontal, 26.1%-temporal, 21.7%- frontotemporal, 2.2%-parietal, 2.2%-occipital, and 2.2%-brainstem; 95.7% had concurrent extraaxial hemorrhage. Mortality rates were 0% (hospital discharge) and 2.3% (six-months), which did not differ by contusion status. On six-month GOSE, 1.6%-GOSE = 1, 28.3%- GOSE = 5-6, 31.5%-GOSE = 7, and 38.6%-GOSE = 8; 45.8% of patients with temporal lobe contusion suffered moderate disability or worse (GOSE <=6) and 41.7% were unable to return to baseline work capacity (RTBWC), compared to 29.1%/20.4% for CT-negative and 26.1%/20.9% for CT-positive without temporal contusion. Temporal lobe contusion conferred multivariable OR= 3.33 (95% CI [1.16- 9.60], p=0.026) for GOSE <=6, and multivariable OR=4.48 ([1.49-13.51], p =0.008) for inability to RTBWC. Parenchymal contusions are predominantly frontal and/or temporal in MTBI and often accompanied by extraaxial hemorrhage. Temporal lobe contusions may be associated with clinically substantive six-month functional impairment.

Comorbidity and functional outcomes in traumatic brain injury: A systematic review,Hanafy S.; Xiong C.; Chan V.; Hu Z.J.; Sutton M.; Escobar M.; Colantonio A.; Mollayeva T. ,"Objective: To systematically review the current evidence examining comorbidity as a prognostic factor of functional outcomes in longitudinal studies published in the adult population with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Evidence Review: All English studies from 1997 to 2017 found through Medline (Medline in Process, ePubs and Medline Daily), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and Psych INFO, and bibliographies of included articles were considered eligible. The medical subject headings (MeSH) for Medline used for our literature search to identify the articles of interest were ''brain injury'', ''comorbidity'', ''risk adjustment'', and ''function.'' The search terms were adapted for use with other bibliographic databases. Two researchers independently screened study titles and/or abstracts and read the full texts of articles for fulfillment of the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. A standardized form used in previous prognostic reviews was used to assess study quality and synthesize study results from the included articles. Quality assessment followed the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology recommendations. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines was used for reporting. Finding(s): Of 7,443 identified citations, 10 cohorts (three prospective and seven retrospective) met the eligibility and quality criteria. Most cohorts (80%) consisted of participants of various injury severities. The mean age across studies was 47.5 years, and men constituted 76%. A significant relationship between several comorbidity types and load, and various functional outcomes was reported in all studies; however the predictive value of each varied with adjustment for socio-demographic and injury-related factors. Heterogeneity at many levels ruled out the possibility of metaanalyses. Conclusion(s): The available evidence on comorbidity alone as a prognostic factor for functional outcomes in TBI is limited and in- conclusive; injury severity, socioeconomic deprivation, and advanced age may be important in understanding a possible relationship.

Characteristics and course of clinical recovery in civilian patients with mild traumatic brain injury (GCS 13-15),Nelson L.D.; Temkin N.R.; Dikmen S.S.; Barber J.; Manley G. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a highly prevalent injury, and the vast majority (> 80%) of TBIs have been historically classified as ""mild"" (mTBI) based on acute injury characteristics. The prevalence and time course of functional limitations for civilian patients with mTBI is unclear owing to variable study methodology in prior research. Our goal was to characterize the nature and time course of recovery in major domains of day-to-day functioning following civilian mTBI in the first year postinjury using data from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study, the largest prospective study of civilian mTBI patients to date. Analyses were stratified on presence (CT+) versus absence (CT-) of acute intracranial findings on clinical head CT. We evaluated TBI patients in the current TRACK-TBI sample with admission GCS scores of 13-15 (N= 1,155, 343 CT+, 781 CT-) as well as trauma controls (N = 213). Participants were enrolled within 24 hours postinjury and completed outcome assessments at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. The primary outcome was return to normal life functioning as measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). At 2 weeks postinjury, only 9% of CT- and 16% of CT+ (p < .001) reported being completely back to normal functioning (GOSE 8). At 12 months, 51% of CT- and 37% of CT+ TBI patients (p < .001) reported being back to normal preinjury levels of functioning in all major life areas. As compared to trauma controls, both TBI groups showed higher rates of interpersonal dysfunction and disabling TBI symptoms at all time points. The findings imply that civilian patients with mTBI, as defined by admission GCS 13- 15, have substantial rates of disability at 12 months postinjury. Furthermore, acute intracranial findings on head CT are associated with poorer functional outcome. These findings suggest that the more favorable prognoses seen in certain head injury populations (i.e., athletes) do not translate to civilian patients treated in level 1 trauma centers. Further work is needed to explicate the mechanisms underlying persistent difficulties faced by this population and to develop effective treatments.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,16,A76,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.29013.abstracts,623884594,#21610,Nelson 2018,,yes
Plasma gfap and UCHL1 levels predict severe disability or worse outcome from traumatic brain injury: A track-TBI Study,Korley F.K.; Yue J.K.; Jain S.; Wang K.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.O.; Stein M.B.; Dikmen S.S.; Levin H.; Temkin N.R.; Giacino J.; Manley G.T.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Introduction: Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Ubiquitin Carboxy-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) are promising biomarkers for identifying TBI patients with intracranial hemorrhage, and were recently approved by FDA for aiding the evaluation of mild TBI. However, the accuracy of these proteins for prognosis of functional recovery has not been studied in adequately powered studies. Method(s): We conducted an analysis of the first 1375 patients enrolled in the Transforming Clinical Research and Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) cohort. TRACK-TBI is an 18-center prospective study of patients evaluated in an emergency department within 24 hours of suffering blunt TBI (defined as per the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine's (ACRM) criteria), and who had a clinically indicated head CT scan. Functional recovery was measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). GFAP and UCH-L1 were measured on plasma samples obtained within 24 hours of injury, by blinded technicians who utilized the Abbott i-STAT System. We employed logistic regression and receiver operator curve analysis to calculate the discriminative abilities of GFAP and UCHL1 for (1) upper severe disability or worse (GOSE<=4) outcome and (2) lower good recovery or worse (GOSE<=7) outcome. Result(s): Subjects studied were predominantly male (68.0%), white (77.5%), involved in a road traffic accident (60.1%), and 40% had traumatic intracranial abnormalities on brain CTs. A total of 929 (74.3%) had 6-month GOSE measurements, and of those with 6-month GOSE measurements, 93 (9.1%) had GOSE<=4 and 642 (62.8%) had GOSE<=7. GFAP and UCHL1 levels were both higher in subjects with low GOSE than in those with high GOSE. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of GFAP for predicting GOSE<=4 at 6 months was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.53-0.60) for predicting GOSE<=7 at 6 months. Similarly, the AUC of UCHL1 for predicting GOSE<=4 at 6 months was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.87) and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54-0.61) for predicting GOSE<=7 at 6 months.

The differential expressed proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and the leukocyte in serum and interleukin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid for evaluating the neurological outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI),Meng H.P.; Wang L.; Peng D.W.; Yang X.P.; Shang C.Z.; Yang S.W. ,"Background: After Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) the blood-brain barrier is destroyed and the foreign bodies are easy to invade [1-2], which laid the foundation for the invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Inflammation induced by TBI is individual-specific, complex, and disturbance handler, associated with high mortality and morbidity. So it is very important to seek some biomarkers to evaluate the inflammation, neurological outcome in TB I[3-4]. The combined use of differentially expressed proteins and effective biomarkers might help in early decision making regarding the aggressiveness of medication, potential new interventions, discharge planning, and rehabilitation. Aim(s): To seek some predictive makers or indicators to evaluate the illness progress and prognosis which is critical to make an early decision in improving the clinical outcome of TBI based on serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or/and indicators. Method(s): In this study, 145 patients were included with TBI and we found the change of patients' leukocyte in serum and interleukin-1(IL-1) in CSF, which strongly correlated with the neurological outcome. In terms of results of leukocyte in blood and IL-1 in CSF, we retained the patient's cerebrospinal fluid specimens and conducted a proteomic analysis. Result(s): A total of 119 differentially expressed proteins were detected between samples of TBI and the normal, which were commonly expressed in all samples, indicating the differentially expressed proteins. When the patients' glasgow outcome score (GOS) improved, IL-1 was downregulated, and when the patients' GCS score deteriorated, IL-1 was upregulated accompanied with the progression TBI.

New prognostic marker in traumatic brain injury patients: PBTO2/PAO2 ratio,Badenes R.; Monleon B.; Martinez-Castro S.; Serrano A.; Garcia M.L. ,"INTRODUCTION. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Neuromonitoring have improved considerably in recent years in TBI patients. Brain tissue oxygenation (pBtO2) is an important variable in TBI patients treatment. OBJECTIVES. The main goal is to examine whether clinical scales (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], Injury Severity Score [ISS], radiographic scales based on admission computed tomography (Marshall), Intra Cranial Pressure [ICP], pBtO2and pBtO2/paO2ratio are associated with clinical outcome after severe TBI. METHODS. This is prospective observational study with institutional review board approval. TBI patients with a GCS <=8 were identified on admission. GCS, ISS, Marshall score, ICP, pBtO2and pBtO2/paO2ratio during first 24 hours were recorded. Patient outcome was deter-mined as favorable (patient had no, little, or moderate disability) or unfavorable (patient died, or was in a vegetative state or had severe disability) using the Glasgow Outcome Scale by medical record re-view at 6 months after TBI. We considered an ordinal analysis with proportional odds methodology. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the 95% CI for the odds of unfavorable outcome. RESULTS. Over a 4-year period, 44 patients were entered into the study. The mean age was 48 +/-28.4 years, ISS was 27.7+/-10.7, and GCS was5.2+/-3.4. At 6 months, 8 (18.18%) patients had died, and 28 (63.63%) had a favorable outcome.Favorable outcome consistently demonstrated higher pBtO2/paO2ratio compared with non-survivors including age as a covariate (p < 0.001). Factors associated with un-favorable outcome (univariate analysis): ISS>50 (OR 1.47, CI 1.22-1.68), Marshall >= 3 (OR 1.88, CI 1.44-2.20), ICP > 20 mmHg (OR 2.88, CI 2.52-3.24), GCS < 5 (OR 2.11, CI 1.94-2.30), PtiO2 < 23 mmHg (OR 2.16, CI 2.05-2.27) and pBtO2/paO2ratio < 0.2 (OR 3.88, CI 3.48-4.27). CONCLUSIONS. The first 24 hours of pBtO2/paO2 ratio < 0.2 predicts mortality and outcome. When pBtO2/paO2 ratio remains below 0.2 in the first 24 hours of monitoring, mortality and unfavorable outcome is increased. This study challenges the brain oxygenation threshold of 23 mm Hg that has been used conventionally and delineates a time for monitoring pBtO2/paO2 ratio that is predictive of outcome.",2018,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,6,Supplement 2,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-018-0201-6,624864482,#21566,Badenes 2018,,yes
MicroRNAs as Novel Biomarkers for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Traumatic Brain Injury,Di Pietro V. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability under the age of 45 years in Western countries. Despite many studies, no reliable biomarkers have been found to assess its severity and predict the recovery. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling has become widely used to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The expression of 754 miRNAs was analysed in serum of 5 mild TBI (mTBI) with extra-cranial injury (EC) patients, 5 severe TBI (sTBI) with EC patients and 5 healthy volunteers (HV) at 1 day and 15 days post injury, by using the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A+B Cards. The aim was to find candidate biomarkers able to discriminate between mild and severe TBI and assess the recovery from mTBI. Following this, it was possible to select 10 miRNAs for further study in an enlarged validation cohort of 120 patients by using single TaqMan assays at the following time points: T0-1h, T4-12h, T48-72h and 15 days from the injury. Analysis revealed 2 miRNAs (miR-425-5p, miR-502) significantly downregulated (p<0.05) in mTBI at early time points and ideal candidates for diagnosis and monitoring the recovery; two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-335) significantly upregulated (p<0.01) and valid biomarkers for the diagnosis of sTBI. In addition, miR425-5p and miR21 at time 0-1h were strongly predictive of 6-month outcome. The panel of selected miRNAs shows promise as biomarkers to discriminate mild from severe TBI and to monitor the recovery from TBI.

Role of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Prognosis of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury,Kumar R.; Ghosh S.; Dhibar T.; Kumar A. ,"Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Long-term clinical outcome following TBI can be difficult to predict. Evaluation of the degree of severity of injury and prediction of outcome are important for the management of these patients. Objective To evaluate whether degree of severity of injury and outcome in moderate to severe TBI is possible by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Materials and Methods Patients with moderate (Glasgow coma scale [GCS] 9-13) and severe head injury (GCS: 5-8), within 1 week of trauma with their normal computed tomographic (CT) scan findings, their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding, and neurologic status were investigated with single-voxel proton MRS (1 H-MRS). The study included 51 patients and 24 controls. Result The MRS study revealed lower ratio of N -acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) and NAA/creatine (Cr) and higher ratio of Cho/Cr and lactate level compared with the control group. The ratio of NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr were statistically significant with initial GCS (p = < 0.00001, r = 0.7595; p = < 0.00001, r = 0.7506; and p < 0.00001, r = -0.5923, respectively), and these ratios were also statistically significant with Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) (p < 0.00001, r = 0.8498, p < 0.00001, r =0.9323, p < 0.00001, r = -0.9082, respectively). The ratio of NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr were also statistically significant with severity of injury (p < 0.0001).

The influence of seizures and periodic discharges on cognitive outcome after brain trauma,Foreman B.; Lee H.; Mizrahi M.; Sharma S.; Woo D.; Ngwenya L.B.; Hartings J.A.; Privitera M. ,"Introduction: Seizures and brain activity patterns that lie along the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC), including periodic and rhythmic patterns, are common after moderate-to-severe TBI but do not correlate with functional outcome. We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized multicenter trial, which included continuous EEG (cEEG) per protocol, to examine the impact of IIC burden on cognitive outcome. Method(s): Validated cEEG terminology was used by certified raters blinded to clinical data. IIC was defined as >=1.5 Hz lateralized rhythmic delta activity or generalized periodic discharges, and any lateralized periodic discharges or seizures. IIC burden was calculated in Hz/Hr based on published criteria. Cognitive outcome was rated by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychology Status (RBANS) global cognition score (RBANS), which ranges from 40-160 with lower values indicating worse cognitive outcome. A generalized linear model was constructed using Poisson distribution and controlling for known prognostic factors and overall injury severity. Result(s): A total of 152 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI were enrolled and underwent cEEG recording. Of these, 133 survived and 89 underwent 3-month cognitive testing. The mean age was 32.2 (SD +/- 13.4) years and 85 (96%) were men. The median (interquartile range) admission GCS was 7 (7-9) and admission ISS was 20 (12-29). A total of 13/89 (14.6%) had IIC patterns or seizures with a median 0.85 Hz-Hr (0.16-2.26) ictal-interictal burden. At 3 months, the median GOSE was 6 (4-8) and the median RBANS score was 80 (73-92). The IIC burden was correlated with the global cognition score (r=-0.57, p=0.04) and was independently associated with global cognition after controlling for core predictor variables and injury severity (OR 0.94, 95CI 0.90-0.98; p=0.002).

Inflammasome proteins are potential biomarkers of traumatic brain injury,Kerr N.; Lee S.W.; Perez-Barcena J.; Crespi C.; Bullock M.R.; Dietrich W.D.; Keane R.W.; De Rivero Vaccari J.P. ,"The innate immune response is a key contributor to the pathology arising after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have previously shown that the inflammasome, an arm of the innate immune response that is involved in the processing of caspase-1 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1b and IL-18, is activated after TBI in rodents and humans. Moreover, inflammasome proteins have been detected at higher levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with patients that presented poor outcomes after TBI. In this study, we analyzed the serum and CSF of 20 patients with TBI and 120 healthy/uninjured donors with the Ella Simple Plex system (Protein Simple) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of inflammasome proteins as biomarkers of TBI. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with associated confidence intervals were obtained following analyses of serum and CSF samples from patients with TBI. ROC curves show that caspase-1 (0.93) and ASC (0.90) in serum are promising biomarkers for TBI pathology, whereas only ASC (1.0) and IL-18 (0.84) had significant ROC values in CSF samples. Importantly, higher ASC protein levels in serum also correlated with poorer outcomes after TBI with an AUC of 0.91 as determined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Taken together, these data suggest that ASC and caspase-1 in serum and ASC and IL-18 in CSF could be potential candidate biomarkers for TBI pathology and prognosis.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,16,A192-A193,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.29013.abstracts,623883936,#21636,Kerr 2018,,yes
Marriage is a predictor of traumatic brain injury severity,Coonfield L.; Griffen M.; Seoudi H.; Ling G.; Brannan T.; Newcomb A.; Aizon A.; Smith K.; Ecklund J. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition with a wide spectrum of injury severity and outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of this condition and the high cost associated with treatment, there is considerable interest in identifying prognostic factors. In this study, we collected NINDS-recommended common data elements for TBI to determine if these data points could be used to produce an individualized risk stratification scheme that can be implemented into clinical practice. Method(s): We prospectively collected data from 45 hospitalized patients between ages 18-80 who were diagnosed with TBI within 30 days of enrollment. Subjects were interviewed at 3 and 6 months after discharge. Result(s): Out of 45 subjects, three subjects died within the follow up period. The mean age of subjects was 54.5 +/- 19.8 (SD) years. Based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) taken at the time of presentation to the emergency department, the distribution of injury severity in our sample was 73.3% mild, 2.2% moderate, and 24.4% severe. Marital status, injury cause, and male gender were found to be predictive of injury severity based on Head-AIS (p = 0.021, p = 0.030, and p = 0.012, respectively), as well as of injury severity based on lowest GCS recorded during admission (p < 0.001, p = 0.010, and p = 0.010, respectively). We did not detect a significant difference based on marital status, injury cause, or gender using survey data at 3 and 6 months among the subjects who completed follow up. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to our knowledge providing evidence that marital status is a predictor of injury severity in TBI patients. Nonmarried subjects had a more severe injury compared to married or divorced, separated, or widowed subjects based on Head- AIS and GCS scores, suggesting that marital status may be a predictor of traumatic brain injury severity. In contrast, married subjects did not have significantly different survey scores at the 3 and 6 month follow up intervals. For future studies, we will assess subjects earlier in the periacute period to determine when the subgroups converge.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic potential of candidate brain injury markers (GFAP, UCHL1, NFL, Tau) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha) for outcome after TBI. Plasma blood samples were collected from TBI subjects enrolled in the TRACK-TBI Pilot Study at three Level I academic medical centers, within 24 hours of injury.

Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-injury using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) (n = 21). Head computed tomography (CT) scans were classified based on the presence or absence of traumatic intracranial CT abnormalities (n = 53). Logistic regression and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) analyses revealed that the four brain-injury proteins combined (GFAP, UCHL1, NFL, Tau) had excellent discriminative ability for presence/absence of traumatic intracranial abnormality (AUC = 0.87). The brain injury proteins were poorly informative with regards to 6 month full recovery (GOSE = 8, AUC= 0.66). When all inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha) were assessed together, they provided prognostic information for 6 month full recovery (GOSE = 8, AUC= 0.72). The combination of brain-injury proteins and inflammatory cytokines provided excellent prognostic information with regards to 6 month full recovery (GOSE = 8, AUC= 0.89). These results suggest that the brain injury protein biomarkers have diagnostic potential while the inflammatory biomarkers show potential to add prognostic information for TBI biomarkers. Further study of the longitudinal changes in multiple inflammatory cytokines and their relation to varying clinical outcomes in a larger cohort, may improve prognostic modeling after TBI and impact clinical practice and research.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,16,A22,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.29013.abstracts,623884653,#21606,Haber 2018,,yes
NF-L IN TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY/ CONCUSSION FOR PRECISION MEDICINE AND AS A PREDICTOR OF OUTCOME,Blennow K. ,"Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion is a major health problem, both at the emergency ward and in sports medicine. More than 10% of individuals with concussion develop a condition called post-concussion syndrome (PCS), and repeated concussions are believed to cause a neurodegenerative disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Biochemical tests would be valuable in the emergency room to identify and grade the severity of neuronal damage and to predict clinical outcome, and also in medical counseling of high-impact contact sport athletes to guide return-to-play decisions. Method(s): Diffuse axonal injury is a central pathophysiological mechanism in mTBI, and thus axonal proteins are top candidates as TBI biomarkers. Clinical studies support the axonal protein neurofilament light (NF-L) in CSF as a key top are candidate biomarkers for acute TBI, but CSF sampling in acute TBI cases is difficult to implement in the clinical situation. The use novel ultra-sensitive techniques give an extraordinary increase in analytical sensitivity down to a few pg/mL, allowing for quantification of NF-L in blood samples. Result(s): Clinical studies on patients with moderate to severe TBI, show that serum NF-L at admission yielded an AUC of 99% or higher. Serum NF-L also predicted both survival and functional outcome at one year. In contrast, serum S100B did not relate to functional outcome. NF-L in blood also show promise as a biomarker to identify neuronal damage and predict prognosis in contact sports athletes with concussion, including professional ice-hockey players, boxers and American football players. Conclusion(s): Measurement of NF-L in blood show promise as a sensitive biomarkers for mild TBI and concussion, both for diagnosis and to predict prognosis. NF-L and other blood biomarkers may also be important tools to explore the relations between neuronal damage and development of PCS and CTE in clinical studies.Copyright © 2018",2018,/,Alzheimer's and Dementia,14,7 Supplement,P604,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2617,2001205131,#21594,Blennow 2018,,yes
Incremental prognostic value of the activated partial thromboplastin time and creatinine in addition to the crash score in traumatic brain injury patients,Solla D.J.F.; Amorim R.L.; Teixeira M.J.; Paiva W.S. ,"INTRODUCTION: The CRASH score is one of the main validated prognostic models for traumatic brain injury (TBI). This and other TBI scores have underevaluated laboratory variables, including coagulopathy markers, which have been implicated on trauma outcomes. We have previously identified the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and creatinine (Cr) as independent predictors of TBI mortality after adjustment for the CRASH score. Objective(s): To verify the incremental prognostic value of the aPTT and Cr in addition to the CRASH score to predict 14-d mortality outcome in TBI patients. METHOD(S): This is a prospective cohort that included consecutive TBI patients admitted to a trauma ICU of a tertiary university hospital from March 2012 to January 2015. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were registered. A new model, CRASH-aPTT-Cr, was created by logistic regression adjustment and compared to the original CRASH score (CT model) regarding calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [H-L] and Brier scores), discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] and integrated discrimination improvement [IDI]), and clinical utility (net reclassifi-cation index [NRI]). RESULT(S): A total 519 patients were included (mean age 41.4 (+/-18.2) yr, 85.1% male, median admission Glasgow Coma Scale 8 (quartiles 6-13)). Neurosurgery was performed on 44.9%. The 14-d mortality was 22.8%. The CRASH-aPTT-Cr score outperformed the CRASH score on calibration, as assessed by the H-L test or the Brier scores (0.118 +/- 0.216 vs 0.132 +/- 0.228, mean difference 0.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.004-0.026, P =.006). The CRASH-aPTT-Cr score also had a better discrimination: AUC-ROC 0.844 +/- 0.024 (vs 0.813 +/- 0.024), P =.067; and IDI 0.32 +/- 0.07 (vs 0.23 +/- 0.06), P =.004. The NRI favored the CRASH-aPTT-Cr, with a net correct reclassification of 11.5% (95% CI 5.2, 17.5%). CONCLUSION(S): The addition of the aPTT and Cr to the CRASH score increased its accuracy. The aPTT may be an early marker of coagu-lopathy and the Cr a marker of basal frailty. Additional studies are required to externally validate this finding and further investigate its implications for TBI management.",2018,/,Clinical Neurosurgery,65,Supplement 1,112,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyy303.190,624640705,#21586,Solla 2018,,yes
Downstream TRPM - 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms correlate with intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury,Jha R.M.; Desai S.M.; Zusman B.E.; Puccio A.M.; Okonkwo D.O.; Park S.Y.; Koleck T.A.; Wallisch J.S.; Shutter L.A.; Kochanek P.M.; Conley Y.P. ,"Background: Cerebral edema in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex consequence of multiple variables including injury mechanism/severity, and different underlying path-ophysiologies. It is associated with unfavorable outcome. Genetic variability explains some clinical heterogeneity in edema formation/resolution and may be valuable for predictive and prognostic enrichment. Sulfonylurea-receptor-1 upregulation (Sur1) increases edema via sodium influx through regulating the Trpm4 cation channel. Channel inhibition by glyburide has shown clinical promise. ABCC8 genetic variability (encoding Sur1) has been reported to predict outcome. We hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRPM4 predict edema and outcome. Method(s): DNA was extracted from 385 consecutively enrolled severe TBI patients of North European ancestry. Exomic and non-exomic SNPs in TRPM4 were genotyped using a multiplex platform. Outcomes include cerebral edema measures (mean and peak intracranial pressure (ICP n=191)) and 6-month Glasgow-Outcome-Scale (n=352). Multivari-able regression analyses controlled for age, gender and initial Glasgow-Coma Scale score. The exact test assessed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using Benjamini-Yekutieli's correction. Result(s): Eleven SNPs were analyzed spanning the 25-exon TRPM4 gene with good coverage. Two SNPs rs8104571 and rs150391806 were associated with edema but not mortality. Homozygous-variants were not present for either SNP in the cohort. In multivariate analysis, average-ICP for rs8104571-heterozygotes was 9.1 mmHg greater than homo-zygous wild-type (p=0.00000029). Peak-ICP was 16.9 mmHg greater in heterozygotes (p=0.003). For rs150391806, hetero-zygotes had increased mean (beta=7.2, p=0.042) and peak (beta=25.95, p=0.004) ICP relative to homozygous wild-type. Homozygous wild-type rs1477363 (OR=0.62, p=0.037) rs10410857 (OR=0.59, p=0.022) and rs909010 (OR=0.59, p=0.027) were not associated with decreased mortality after the Benjamini-Yekutieli correction. Both rs8104571 (intron 20) and rs150391806 (exon 24) spatially clustered downstream. They covered a region of linkage dis-equilibrium encoding the channel pore and a region interacting with the regulatory channel Sur1 encoded by ABCC8 SNPs previously identified as being associated with cerebral edema and ICP in TBI. Conclusion(s): In a cohort of severe TBI patients, variant TRPM4 alleles increased edema risk, similar to prior reports of the related gene ABCC8. Effect sizes were large and could have clinical implications. Both significant TRPM4 SNPs clustered downstream, spanning a region encoding the channel pore. Since glyburide inhibits the Sur1-Trpm4 channel, these results, if validated, may lay groundwork for risk stratification and treatment responder classification related to cerebral edema, along with informing on overall prognosis in TBI and other neurological disorders. Larger confirmatory/multi-center studies are warranted.",2018,/,Annals of Neurology,84,Supplement 22,S271-S272,,,624732732,#21580,Jha 2018,,yes
High sensitivity C-reactive protein: Potential biomarker of inflammation in acute mTBI,Shetty T.; Cogsil T.; Dalal A.; Halvorsen K.; Cummings K.; Nguyen J. ,"Objective This study investigated the utility of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) as a blood biomarker for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Background Validation of a blood biomarker panel will greatly improve mTBI diagnosis and prognosis. hsCRP has been validated as a sensitive biomarker for inflammation. Previous studies have established relationships between CRP levels and TBI, but the utilization of hsCRP levels in assessing mTBI requires further exploration. Methods Retrospective chart review collected hsCRP values in acute mTBI patients seen within 30 days of injury. Patients with any comorbid diagnosis known to cause elevation of inflammatory proteins were excluded. Continuous hsCRP levels were transformed into quartiles: <0.200 mg/L for Quartile 1 (Q1) 0.200-0.415 mg/L for Quartile 2 (Q2) 0.415-1.100 mg/L for Quartile 3 (Q3) and >=1.100 mg/L for Quartile 4 (Q4). Multivariable binary logistic regression modeling identified potential factors for elevated hsCRP at first visit. Cox regression analysis identified potential factors for delayed time to recovery. Results Three hundred twelve injuries in 311 patients were reviewed (mean age 21 +/- 12 years, 53% female). Mean hsCRP was elevated patients who presented within 2 days of injury and was found to significantly decrease between first visit and 4 weeks post-injury (p = 0.016). Initial hsCRP level was positively correlated with age (r = 0.163, p = 0.004) and negatively associated with previous concussion history (p = 0.031). When analyzed as quartiles, patients in Q4 were more likely to have endorsed headache (p = 0.036) or fatigue (p = 0.030). Age significantly increased between quartiles (p = 0.013). Multivariable binary logistic regression showed that increased age (OR: 3.48) and patients presenting with headache (OR: 3.48) or fatigue (OR: 2.16) were significantly associated with increased risk of having an hsCRP level in Q4. Females (HR: 0.32) and increased age (HR: 0.95) were associated delayed time to recovery.

D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio for the prediction of progressive hemorrhagic injury after traumatic brain injury.,"Xu, De-Xiao; Du, Wu-Tao; Li, Xiang; Wu, Zhi-Xiang; Yu, Guo-Feng","BACKGROUND: Progressive hemorrhagic injury (PHI) greatly affects prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (D/F ratio) may be a potential predictor for venous thromboembolism. This study sought to describe and evaluate any relationship between D/F ratio and PHI after TBI., METHODS: This retrospective study included a cohort of 192 TBI patients. Plasma D-dimer and fibrinogen were measured, and subsequently D/F ratio was calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of PHI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was conFig.d to analyze predictive capability for PHI., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients (22.4%) experienced PHI. Both Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score (odds ratio [OR], 0.565; 95% CI, 0.464-0.689) and D/F ratio (OR, 4.026; 95% CI, 2.219-7.305) were the two independent predictor for PHI. Area under ROC curve (AUC) of D/F ratio was similar to that of GCS score (AUC, 0.816; 95% CI, 0.754-0.868 vs. AUC, 0.834; 95% CI, 0.773-0.883; P = 0.699). Moreover, D/F ratio significantly improved AUC of GCS score to 0.928 (95% CI, 0.881-0.960; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: D/F ratio was strongly predictive of PHI in the studied cohort and, thereby should be considered in the clinical management of TBI patients.

Association of age with long-term psychosocial outcome following traumatic brain injury,Senathi-Raja D.; Ponsford J.; Schonberger M. ,"Objective: To examine the association of age with long-term psychosocial outcome following traumatic brain injury. Participant(s): One hundred and twelve participants with mild to very severe traumatic brain injury, aged 26-89 years at 5-22 years post-injury, 112 significant others and 112 healthy controls matched for current age, gender, education and estimated IQ. Method(s): Changes in occupational activity, interpersonal relationships and independent living skills were assessed in participants with traumatic brain injury using the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS). Employment status of participants with traumatic brain injury and control participants was compared at the time of assessment. Result(s): No age effects were demonstrated on the 3 SPRS domains. However, compared with healthy individuals, older participants with traumatic brain injury showed greater likelihood of unemployment relative to younger participants with traumatic brain injury. Conclusion(s): By using matched controls this study has demonstrated that older individuals with traumatic brain injury are less likely to return to the workforce than younger individuals with traumatic brain injury. Other aspects of psychosocial outcome appeared to be less affected by age, although specific domains require closer examination in relation to healthy age-matched controls. © 2009 The Authors.",2009,/,Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine,41,8,666-673,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2340/16501977-0396,354987236,#24719,Senathi-Raja 2009,,
Role of LCF scale as an outcome prognostic index in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Rossato, Elena; Verzini, Elisabetta; Scandola, Michele; Ferrari, Federico; Bonadiman, Silvia","The disabling effects of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) present a significant healthcare concern to developed countries. In order to achieve a reliable prognosis, validated assessment scales are used to monitor the cognitive outcome, like the Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale, or the overall functional outcome, namely the Functional Independence Measure and Glasgow Outcome Scale. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale (LCF) as an outcome prognostic index in patients with TBI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with TBI with a mean age of 44.9 years (SD 20.915) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were evaluated at admission and at discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale, Functional Independence Measure, and Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was also implemented at 6 months after discharge (OUTCOME.GOS), whereas the LCF was used twice a week throughout hospitalization. For our purpose, we named LCF at admission LCFa, whereas permanence in the same LCF value (number of days), LCFaL., RESULTS: DELTA.GOS, DELTA.FIM (DELTA = difference between value at discharge and at admission), and OUTCOME.GOS were significantly affected by age, length of stay, LCFa, and LCFaL., CONCLUSION: The LCF can give a valuable indication to the prognosis of patients with TBI besides monitoring changes in cognitive function. This allows for individual rehabilitation plan, and long-term management strategies could be developed more quickly upon patient's discharge.

A better understanding of their role in the diagnosis, characterization, and management of TBI is essential for upcoming clinical implementation. In the current investigation, we aimed to explore longitudinal trajectories of brain injury exosomal proteins in blood of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, and to evaluate the relation with the free-circulating counterpart and patient imaging and clinical parameters. Exosomal levels of glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) and neuronal/axonal (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and total-tau (t-tau)) proteins were measured in serum of 21 patients for up 5 days after injury using single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Group-based trajectory analysis was used to generate distinct temporal exosomal biomarker profiles. We found altered profiles of serum brain injury exosomal proteins following injury. The dynamics and levels of exosomal and related free-circulating markers, although correlated, showed differences. Patients with diffuse injury displayed higher acute exosomal NFL and GFAP concentrations in serum than those with focal lesions. Exosomal UCH-L1 profile characterized by acutely elevated values and a secondary steep rise was associated with early mortality (n = 2) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Serum brain injury exosomal proteins yielded important diagnostic and prognostic information and represent a novel means to unveil underlying pathophysiology in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI.

Prognostic significance of abnormal hematological parameters in severe traumatic brain injury requiring decompressive craniectomy.,"Corbett, Jade-Marie; Ho, Kwok M; Honeybul, Stephen","OBJECTIVE: Hematological abnormalities after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common, and are associated with a poor outcome. Whether these abnormalities offer additional prognostic significance over and beyond validated TBI prognostic models is uncertain., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the ability of admission hematological abnormalities to that of the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials) prognostic model to predict 18-month neurological outcome of 388 patients who required a decompressive craniectomy after severe TBI, between 2004 and 2016, in Western Australia. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to assess predictors' ability to discriminate between patients with and without an unfavorable outcome of death, vegetative state, or severe disability., RESULTS: Of the 388 patients included in the study, 151 (38.9%) had an unfavorable outcome at 18 months after decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI. Abnormalities in admission hemoglobin (AUROC 0.594, p = 0.002), plasma glucose (AUROC 0.592, p = 0.002), fibrinogen (AUROC 0.563, p = 0.036), international normalized ratio (INR; AUROC 0.645, p = 0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (AUROC 0.564, p = 0.033), and disseminated intravascular coagulation score (AUROC 0.623, p = 0.001) were all associated with a higher risk of unfavorable outcome at 18 months after severe TBI. As a marker of inflammation, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was not significantly associated with the risk of unfavorable outcome (AUROC 0.500, p = 0.998). However, none of these parameters, in addition to the platelet count, were significantly associated with an unfavorable outcome after adjusting for the IMPACT predicted risk (odds ratio [OR] per 10% increment in risk 2.473, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.061-2.967; p = 0.001). After excluding 8 patients (2.1%) who were treated with warfarin prior to the injury, there was a suggestion that INR was associated with some additional prognostic significance (OR 3.183, 95% CI 0.856-11.833; p = 0.084) after adjusting for the IMPACT predicted risk., CONCLUSIONS: In isolation, INR was the best hematological prognostic parameter in severe TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy, especially when patients treated with warfarin were excluded. However, the prognostic significance of admission hematological abnormalities was mostly captured by the IMPACT prognostic model, such that they did not offer any additional prognostic information beyond the IMPACT predicted risk.

The prognostic reliability of intracranial pressure monitoring and MRI data in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Woischneck, Dieter; Kapapa, Thomas","OBJECTIVE: The predictive quality of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has for many years been a matter of debate. We correlate ICP data comparing MRI data with the outcome after severe traumatic brain injury to evaluate their prognostic potency., METHODS: This study compares the results of ICP monitoring, MRI, coma duration and outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale obtained in 32 patients having suffered severe TBI. Level of significance was set to p<=0.05 in statistical tests., RESULTS: The MRI results were closely correlated with coma duration and Glasgow Outcome Scale, but the ICP measurements were not. With the exception of severe, bipontine lesions, there is no other region of the brain in which increased evidence of traumatogenic lesions emerges as the intracranial pressure rises. Just bipontine lesions that proof to be infaust correlate with elevated ICP values., CONCLUSION: ICP monitoring does not allow individual prognostic conclusions to be made. Implantation of an intracranial pressure sensor alone for making a prognostic estimate is not advisable. The use of intracranial pressure measurements in the retrospective appraisal of disease progress is highly problematic. However, MRI diagnostic in patients with severe TBI improves prognostic potency of clinical parameters. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Risk Factors and Outcomes Associated with Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury in Patients with Mild or Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Hoffman, Haydn; Bunch, Katherine M; Protas, Matthew; Chin, Lawrence S","BACKGROUND: Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) represents a spectrum of traumatic injuries to the carotid and vertebral arteries that is an often-overlooked source of morbidity and mortality. Its incidence, risk factors, and effect on outcomes in patients with mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have not been studied independently., METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank from 2013 to 2017 was queried to identify patients with mTBI who suffered blunt injuries. BCVI was identified using abbreviated injury scores and included blunt carotid artery injury (BCAI) and blunt vertebral artery injury (BVAI). A binary logistic regression was used to identify patient-related and injury-related factors associated with BCVI. Binary logistic regressions were also performed to evaluate the effect of BCVI on stroke, in-hospital mortality, nonroutine discharge disposition, total length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, and number of days mechanically ventilated., RESULTS: Of 485,880 patients with mTBI, there were 4,382 (0.9%) with BCVI. Cervical spine fracture was the strongest factor associated with BCAI (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.77-2.19), followed by mandible fracture and basilar skull fracture. Cervical spine fracture also had the strongest association with BVAI (OR, 18.28; 95% CI, 16.47-20.28), followed by spinal cord injury and neck contusion. Stroke was more common in patients with BCAI (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 4.19-7.21) and BVAI (OR, 7.238; 95% CI, 5.929-8.836). BVAI increased the odds of mortality, but BCAI did not. Both were associated with nonroutine discharge and increased LOS, intensive care unit LOS, and number of days mechanically ventilated., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BCVI in patients with mTBI is low, and it usually does not require invasive treatment. However, it is associated with greater odds of stroke and negative outcomes. Knowledge of risk factors for BCVI may tailor further investigation to aid prompt diagnosis.

A Multi-Modal Assessment of Clinical Predictors for Traumatic Brain Injury End-Points.,"Zou, Lin F; Pierce, Benjamin; Nielson, Jessica L","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex injury that has a multi-faceted recovery process. The current ""gold standard"" for classifying severity of TBI symptoms is the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), a crude measure of overall dysfunction after TBI. Exploratory factor analysis performed on TRACK-TBI Pilot (N = 297) identified candidate multi-variate outcome measures of neuropsychological impairment and cognitive speed and flexibility at 6 months post-TBI that were confirmed in data from the COBRIT study (N = 645) using confirmatory factor analysis. These new outcome measures were used as the dependent variables in an ordinal logistic regression model, using common data elements (CDE) collected in the emergency department as independent variables, including basic demographics, socioeconomic status, medical history, and measures of blood alcohol and blood pressure. We directly compared these prediction models with the GOSE as the 6-month outcome variable and found that in both the TRACK-TBI pilot and COBRIT studies, both neuropsychiatric complications (approx. 36.0% and 22.3% variance explained) and cognitive speed and flexibility (approx. 33.9% and 24.5% variance explained) were better explained by the prediction model, compared with GOSE (approx. 19.9% and 14.4% variance explained), respectively. While differences in overall distributions of impairment between TRACK-TBI pilot and COBRIT exist and should be explored further for applications of these prediction models, we think these multi-variate end-points more accurately characterize patients' functioning at six-months post-TBI. A multi-variate assessment of end-points seems especially important for characterizing TBI outcomes in cases where gross impairment, such as those measured by the GOSE, may be less evident.",2021,/,Journal of neurotrauma,38,2,261-271,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7222,33023400,#4464,Zou 2021,,
Complex Autoantibody Responses Occur following Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Needham, Edward J; Stoevesandt, Oda; Thelin, Eric P; Zetterberg, Henrik; Zanier, Elisa R; Al Nimer, Faiez; Ashton, Nicholas J; Outtrim, Joanne G; Newcombe, Virginia F J; Mousa, Hani S; Simren, Joel; Blennow, Kaj; Yang, Zhihui; Hutchinson, Peter J; Piehl, Fredrik; Helmy, Adel E; Taussig, Mike J; Wang, Kevin K W; Jones, Joanne L; Menon, David K; Coles, Alasdair J","Most of the variation in outcome following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unexplained by currently recognized prognostic factors. Neuroinflammation may account for some of this difference. We hypothesized that TBI generated variable autoantibody responses between individuals that would contribute to outcome. We developed a custom protein microarray to detect autoantibodies to both CNS and systemic Ags in serum from the acute-phase (the first 7 d), late (6-12 mo), and long-term (6-13 y) intervals after TBI in human patients. We identified two distinct patterns of immune response to TBI. The first was a broad response to the majority of Ags tested, predominantly IgM mediated in the acute phase, then IgG dominant at late and long-term time points. The second was responses to specific Ags, most frequently myelin-associated glycopeptide (MAG), which persisted for several months post-TBI but then subsequently resolved. Exploratory analyses suggested that patients with a greater acute IgM response experienced worse outcomes than predicted from current known risk factors, suggesting a direct or indirect role in worsening outcome. Furthermore, late persistence of anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies correlated with raised serum neurofilament light concentrations at these time points, suggesting an association with ongoing neurodegeneration over the first year postinjury. Our results show that autoantibody production occurs in some individuals following TBI, can persist for many years, and is associated with worse patient outcome. The complexity of responses means that conventional approaches based on measuring responses to single antigenic targets may be misleading.

Comparison of Two Predictive Models for Short-Term Mortality in Patients after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Kesmarky, Klara; Delhumeau, Cecile; Zenobi, Marie; Walder, Bernhard","The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region (HAIS) are validated prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic performance of an alternative predictive model including motor GCS, pupillary reactivity, age, HAIS, and presence of multi-trauma for short-term mortality with a reference predictive model including motor GCS, pupil reaction, and age (IMPACT core model). A secondary analysis of a prospective epidemiological cohort study in Switzerland including patients after severe TBI (HAIS >3) with the outcome death at 14 days was performed. Performance of prediction, accuracy of discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]), calibration, and validity of the two predictive models were investigated. The cohort included 808 patients (median age, 56; interquartile range, 33-71), median GCS at hospital admission 3 (3-14), abnormal pupil reaction 29%, with a death rate of 29.7% at 14 days. The alternative predictive model had a higher accuracy of discrimination to predict death at 14 days than the reference predictive model (AUROC 0.852, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.824-0.880 vs. AUROC 0.826, 95% CI 0.795-0.857; p < 0.0001).

The impact of cultural background on outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Ponsford, Jennie; Downing, Marina; Pechlivanidis, Helen","Most traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcome studies have been conducted in developed countries involving individuals from the dominant culture. The present study compared outcomes following TBI in individuals from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds with those from non-CALD backgrounds. 103 CALD and 103 non-CALD participants with predominantly moderate to severe TBI completed a series of questionnaires an average of 22 months post-injury. Groups were comparable in most demographic and injury-related variables, but CALD participants had lower pre-injury employment rates. Individuals in the CALD group were significantly less independent in light domestic duties, shopping, and financial management and reported significantly lower cognitive independence, mobility, and participation in occupational and social activities than non-CALD participants post-injury. They also reported heightened awareness of post-injury deficits, different beliefs regarding injury consequences and factors aiding recovery, more anxiety and depression symptoms, and less problem-focused coping. Higher functional outcome was associated with having a value system that is Australian, younger age at injury, and higher education. Overall, independent of rehabilitation access, individuals from a CALD background showed poorer functional outcome following TBI than those from a non-CALD background. Addressing this discrepancy should be a priority for rehabilitation programmes.",2020,/,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,30,1,85-100,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09602011.2018.1453367,29607708,#4961,Ponsford 2020,,
Prognostic indicators and outcome prediction model for severe traumatic brain injury,Tasaki O.; Shiozaki T.; Hamasaki T.; Kajino K.; Nakae H.; Tanaka H.; Shimazu T.; Sugimoto H. ,"BACKGROUND: Although some predictive models for patient outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury have been proposed, a mathematical model with high predictive value has not been established. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the most important indicators of prognosis and to develop the best outcome prediction model. METHOD(S): One hundred eleven consecutive patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of <9 were examined and 14 factors were evaluated. Intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded at admission to the intensive care unit. The absence of the basal cisterns, presence of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, and degree of midline shift were evaluated by means of computed tomography within 24 hours after injury. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for a poor prognosis and to develop the best prediction model. RESULT(S): The best model included the following variables: age (p < 0.01), light reflex (p = 0.01), extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.01), intracranial pressure (p = 0.04), and midline shift (p = 0.12). Positive predictive value of the model was 97.3%, negative predictive value was 87.1%, and overall predictive value was 94.2%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.977, and the p value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.866. CONCLUSION(S): Our predictive model based on age, absence of light reflex, presence of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial pressure, and midline shift was shown to have high predictive value and will be useful for decision making, review of treatment, and family counseling in case of traumatic brain injury. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",2009,/,"Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care",66,2,304-308,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31815d9d3f,354985023,#24458,Tasaki 2009,,
"Increased levels of interleukin-6, - 8 and - 10 are associated to fatal outcome in men with severe traumatic brain injury",Ferreira L.C.B.; Regner A.; Simon D.; Ikuta N.; Da Silva Carvalho F.; Mioto K.D.L.; Vargas A.E.; Ghies J.A. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major cause of death among individuals between 1-45 years-old. The outcome of the TBI patients may be related to both the severity of the primary lesion and the extent of the secondary brain damage. Secondary brain damage is associated with neuroinflammatory phenomena, characterized by activation of microglia and astrocytes, damage to the blood-brain barrier and production of cytokines. Although increased cytokine production and cellular inflammation are clearly involved on the pathophysiology of TBI, no clear relationships have been established between measurements of cytokines and clinical outcome following TBI. The present study was designed to examine which changes in cytokine levels (of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha) are associated with primary outcome (death or survival) and clinical measures following severe TBI in men. The study group consisted of 24 male patients, victims of severe TBI. Venous blood samples were taken in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (study entry), 24 and 48 hours later. The plasma cytokine levels were assayed by flow cytometry. Severe TBI was associated with a 42% mortality rate. TBI patients had significant increase in the levels of all cytokines measured, except for IL-1 beta, compared to controls. Statistically significant increases in the IL- 10, - 8 and - 6 levels were observed in non-survivors TBI patients compared to survivors subgroup measured in the first sample (study entry) and in the subsequent sample (24 hours latter). There were no significant differences in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-12p70 levels between survivors and non-survivors in any time investigated. Our findings indicate that increased IL-10, - 8 and - 6 levels may constitute an early predictor of unfavorable outcome in severe TBI patients.",2011,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,28,6,A50-A51,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.9945,70479825,#24217,Ferreira 2011,,

Outcomes of traumatic brain injury: the prognostic accuracy of various scores and models.,"Charry, Jose D; Navarro-Parra, Sandra; Solano, Juan; Moscote-Salazar, Luis; Pinzon, Miguel Angel; Tejada, Jorman Harvey","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a worldwide health problem, and is a pathology that causes significant mortality and disability in Latin America. Different scores and prognostic models have been developed in order to predict the neurological outcomes of patients. We aimed to test the prognostic accuracy of the Marshall CT classification system, the Rotterdam CT scoring system, and the IMPACT and CRASH models, in predicting 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavourable outcomes in a cohort of trauma patients with TBI in a university hospital in Colombia., METHODS: We analysed 309 patients with significant TBI who were treated in a regional trauma centre in Colombia over a two year period. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken. The discriminatory power of each model, as well as its accuracy and precision, were assessed by logistic regression and AUC. Shapiro Wilks, chi2 and Wilcoxon test were used to compare the actual outcomes in the cohort against the predicted outcomes., RESULTS: The median age was 32 years, and 77.67% were male. All four prognostic models showed good accuracy in predicting outcomes. The IMPACT model had the greatest accuracy in predicting an unfavourable outcome (AUC 0.864; 95% CI 0.819 - 0.909) and in predicting mortality (AUC 0.902; 95% CI 0.862 - 0.943) in patients with TBI., CONCLUSION: All four prognostic models are applicable to eligible TBI patients in Colombia.

Modified Glasgow Coma Scale Using Serum Factors as a Prognostic Model in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Bae, In-Suk; Chun, Hyoung-Joon; Yi, Hyeong-Joong; Bak, Koang-Hum; Choi, Kyu-Sun; Kim, Dong-Won","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. This study evaluated a possible relationship between serum factors at admission and the outcome of TBI. We propose a statistically validated scale for patients with TBI that combines serum factors and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)., METHODS: Between May 2011 and July 2016, 219 patients underwent decompressive craniectomy for TBI. We assessed laboratory data on admission, and correlations with GSC and Glasgow Outcome Scale were investigated. The modified GCS was developed from a multivariable logistic regression model, which was validated with the backward stepwise method., RESULTS: Of 219 patients with TBI enrolled in our study, 175 were men (79.9%) and 44 were women (20.1%) with a mean age of 49.1 +/- 11.5 years. Initial serum values of hemoglobin, platelets, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with in-hospital mortality. The factor score was derived by adding the following points: hemoglobin (>=13.0 g/dL = 0, <13.0 g/dL = 1), platelets (>=150 x 103/mm3 = 0, <150 x 103/mm3 = 1), prothrombin time (<13.2 seconds = 0, >=13.2 seconds = 1), and lactate dehydrogenase (<271 U/L = 0, >=271 U/L = 1). The modified GCS score (GCS score [range, 6-15] - FS [range, 0-4]) was calculated., CONCLUSIONS: The modified GCS score using serum factors extended the information provided about patient outcomes to be comparable to more complex methods.

Genetic Variation in the TP53 Gene and Patient Outcomes Following Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Mellett, Kaleigh; Ren, Dianxu; Alexander, Sheila; Osier, Nicole; Beers, Sue R; Okonkwo, David O; Puccio, Ava M; Conley, Yvette P","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, with more than 5 million people in the United States living with long-term complications related to TBI. This study examined the relationship between TP53, the gene that codes for the protein p53, and outcome variability following severe TBI. The p53 protein impacts neuronal apoptosis following TBI, thus investigation into TP53 genetic variability as a prognosticator for TBI outcomes (mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS], Neurobehavioral Rating Scale [NRS], and Disability Rating Scale [DRS]) is warranted. Participants (N = 429) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <=8) were enrolled into a prospective study with outcomes assessed over 24 months following injury. The single-nucleotide polymorphism Arg72Pro (rs1042522), a functional missense polymorphism for which the CC homozygous genotype is most efficient at inducing apoptosis, was investigated. Individuals with the CC genotype (arginine homozygotes) were more likely to have poorer outcomes at 24 months following TBI compared to individuals with CG/GG genotypes (GOS: p = .048, DRS: p = .022). These findings add to preliminary evidence that p53 plays a role in recovery following TBI and, if further replicated, could support investigations into p53-based therapies for treating TBI.",2020,/,Biological research for nursing,22,3,334-340,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1099800420912335,32207313,#4771,Mellett 2020,,
Body Temperature after EMS Transport: Association with Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes.,"Gaither, Joshua B; Chikani, Vatsal; Stolz, Uwe; Viscusi, Chad; Denninghoff, Kurt; Barnhart, Bruce; Mullins, Terry; Rice, Amber D; Mhayamaguru, Moses; Smith, Jennifer J; Keim, Samuel M; Bobrow, Bentley J; Spaite, Daniel W","INTRODUCTION: Low body temperatures following prehospital transport are associated with poor outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, a minimal amount is known about potential associations across a range of temperatures obtained immediately after prehospital transport. Furthermore, a minimal amount is known about the influence of body temperature on non-mortality outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between temperatures obtained immediately following prehospital transport and TBI outcomes across the entire range of temperatures., METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all moderate/severe TBI cases (CDC Barell Matrix Type 1) in the pre-implementation cohort of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) TBI Study (NIH/NINDS: 1R01NS071049). Cases were compared across four cohorts of initial trauma center temperature (ITCT): <35.0degreeC [Very Low Temperature (VLT)]; 35.0-35.9degreeC [Low Temperature (LT)]; 36.0-37.9degreeC [Normal Temperature (NT)]; and >=38.0degreeC [Elevated Temperature (ET)]. Multivariable analysis was performed adjusting for injury severity score, age, sex, race, ethnicity, blunt/penetrating trauma, and payment source. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality were calculated. To evaluate non-mortality outcomes, deaths were excluded and the adjusted median increase in hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS and total hospital charges were calculated for each ITCT group and compared to the NT group., RESULTS: 22,925 cases were identified and cases with interfacility transfer (7361, 32%), no EMS transport (1213, 5%), missing ITCT (2083, 9%), or missing demographic data (391, 2%) were excluded. Within this study cohort the aORs for death (compared to the NT group) were 2.41 (CI: 1.83-3.17) for VLT, 1.62 (CI: 1.37-1.93) for LT, and 1.86 (CI: 1.52-3.00) for ET. Similarly, trauma center (TC) LOS, ICU LOS, and total TC charges increased in all temperature groups when compared to NT., CONCLUSION: In this large, statewide study of major TBI, both ETs and LTs immediately following prehospital transport were independently associated with higher mortality and with increased TC LOS, ICU LOS, and total TC charges.

Formulation of a Three-Tier Cisternal Grade as a Predictor of In-Hospital Outcome from a Prospective Study of Patients with Traumatic Intracranial Hematoma.,"Avanali, Raghunath; Bhadran, Biju; Panchal, Sunil; Kumar, P Krishna; Vijayan, Abhisek; Aneeze, M Musthafa; Harison, G","OBJECTIVE: Outcome prediction is of paramount importance in traumatic brain injury. Our objective of conducting this prospective study was to identify the predictors needed to formulate a prognostic score., METHODS: Clinical and radiologic characteristics of 100 patients with traumatic intracranial hematoma were analyzed. Key measurements were taken in the midbrain and pontine regions and the status of each of the 9 basal cisterns was noted, by giving a score of 1 if they were visible and 0 if not. All the predictors were analyzed for outcome., RESULTS: Total cisternal score was found to be an independent predictor of outcome. A grade was formulated by dividing the score into 3 levels., CONCLUSIONS: The model based on cisternal status described in the study is technically simple and conveys the information regarding the outcome to the treating neurosurgeon. Because the score obtained seems to have low interobserver variation, we believe that it can be a useful tool not only in recording data in case files and interphysician communication but also in research into traumatic brain injury.

Preinjury resilience and mood as predictors of early outcome following mild traumatic brain injury.,"McCauley, Stephen R; Wilde, Elisabeth A; Miller, Emmy R; Frisby, Melissa L; Garza, Hector M; Varghese, Reni; Levin, Harvey S; Robertson, Claudia S; McCarthy, James J","There is significant heterogeneity in outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While several host factors (age, gender, and preinjury psychiatric history) have been investigated, the influence of preinjury psychological resilience and mood status in conjunction with mild TBI remains relatively unexplored. Euthymic mood and high resilience are potentially protective against anxiety and postconcussion symptoms, but their relative contributions are currently unknown. This prospective study obtained preinjury estimates of resilience and mood measures in addition to measures of anxiety (Acute Stress Disorder Scale and PTSD-Checklist-Civilian form) and postconcussion symptom severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire) <24 hours (Baseline), 1 week, and 1 month postinjury in patients with either mTBI (n=46) or a comparison group with orthopedic injuries not involving the head (OI, n=29). The groups did not differ on preinjury resilience or mood status at baseline, but differed significantly on measures of anxiety and postconcussion symptom severity at each subsequent study occasion. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to determine if preinjury resilience and mood were significant contributors to anxiety and postconcussion symptoms during the first month postinjury after accounting for other known host factors (e.g., age at injury, gender, and education). Injury group and preinjury mood status were significant predictors for all three dependent variables at each study occasion (all p<0.007). Preinjury resilience showed a positive trend only for acute stress severity at baseline, but demonstrated significant prediction of all three dependent measures at one week and one month postinjury. These results suggest that preinjury depressed mood and resilience are significant contributors to the severity of postinjury anxiety and postconcussion symptoms, even after accounting for effects of other specific host factors.",2013,/,Journal of neurotrauma,30,8,642-52,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.2393,23046394,#8490,McCauley 2013,,

Use of Hematocrit for Short-Term Prognosis of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury After Decompressive Craniectomy.,"Zhou, Jin-Kui; Zhang, Qi-Shuo; Chen, Yu-Qiang; Li, Mu; Xie, Yang; Ke, Jia-Jie; Lin, Huan-Zhang; Zhang, Yao-Wei","OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effects of the hematocrit (Hct) in patients with traumatic brain injury after decompressive craniectomy (DC)., METHODS: Demographic data, inspection and treatment procedures, and 30-day prognosis were obtained for 158 patients with head injury who underwent unilateral DC in our hospital between January 2013 and June 2018. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression was applied to analyze independent risk factors for 30-day outcome. The quantitative analysis of postoperative Hct, DELTAHct (postoperative Hct minus initial Hct), and their combination for the prognosis of patients with TBI was displayed graphically using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Multiple linear regression was used to explore factors influencing postoperative Hct and DELTAHct., RESULTS: Short-term mortality was 29.7%. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.064; P = 0.024), Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.711; P = 0.027), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (OR, 1.156; P = 0.047), midline shift in millimeters (OR, 1.809; P <0.001), postoperative Hct (OR, 0.743; P = 0.001), and DELTAHct (OR, 1.242; P =0.048) were independent risk factors for short-term death. In ROC curves, a combination of postoperative Hct and DELTAHct showed the highest sensitivity (77.5%) and highest specificity (89.4%). When using this combination to predict prognosis, we could achieve an accuracy of 94.5%. ISS (beta = -0.172, P = 0.022), initial Hct (beta = 0.243, P = 0.001), principal hematoma location (beta = -2.628, P < 0.001), hours of operation (beta = -0.884, P = 0.048), and colloid quantity (beta = -0.002, P = 0.001) were independent contributing factors for DELTAHct, which was similar to postoperative Hct., CONCLUSIONS: A combination of postoperative Hct and DELTAHct could better predict short-term survival of patients with TBI. Developing an appropriate treatment strategy to increase postoperative Hct and reduce the DELTAHct may be good for the short-term prognosis of patients with TBI after DC.

Serum TP was identified as an independent predictor for the preceding prognostic variables, its prognostic predictive ability was similar to that of GCS score and it also significantly improved prognostic predictive ability of GCS score., CONCLUSION: Serum TP may be intimately linked with in inflammation, disease progression and poor prognosis in TBI patients.

Evaluation of serum pannexin-1 as a prognostic biomarker for traumatic brain injury.,"Ni, Bu-Kao; Cai, Jian-Yong; Lin, Qun; Zheng, Kai-Hui; Lin, Li; Wu, Jian-Hua","BACKGROUND: Pannexin-1 is a type of hexameric plasma membrane channel-forming proteins, and plays a significant role in brain injury. We investigated the potential prognostic value of pannexin-1 in traumatic brain injury., METHODS: A single peripheral blood sample in 112 patients with severe traumatic brain injury and 112 controls was prospectively collected for subsequent measurement of serum pannexin-1. Clinical follow-up was performed at 6months. An unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3., RESULTS: The patients showed markedly higher serum pannexin-1 concentrations than the controls. Among the patients, pannexin-1 concentrations were significantly and negatively correlated with Glasgow coma scale scores. On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the predictive value in terms of area under the curve was substantially high for serum pannexin-1 as a predictor for both 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome. Regression analyses confirmed that there was an increased risk of either 6-month mortality, overall survival or unfavorable outcome associated with serum pannexin-1 concentrations after adjusting for possible confounders., CONCLUSIONS: Serum pannexin-1 may represent a potential prognostic biomarker for head trauma.

Outcome after severe brain trauma associated with epidural hematoma.,"Leitgeb, Johannes; Mauritz, Walter; Brazinova, Alexandra; Majdan, Marek; Wilbacher, Ingrid","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify factors contributing to outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) associated with epidural hematoma (EDH)., METHODS: Between 02/2002 and 4/2010 17 Austrian centers prospectively enrolled 863 patients with moderate and severe TBI into observational studies. Data on accident, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Data sets from patients who had severe TBI (=Glasgow Coma Scale score <9) and EDH were selected. Six-month outcomes were classified as ""favorable"" if Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were 5 or 4, and were classified as ""unfavorable"" if GOS scores were 3 or less. The Rotterdam score was used to classify computed tomography (CT) findings; the scores published by Hukkelhoven et al. (J Neurotrauma 22:1025-1039, 2005) were used to estimate predicted rates of death and of unfavorable outcomes. Univariate (Fisher's exact test, t test, Chi(2)-test) and multivariate (logistic regression) statistics were used to identify factors associated with hospital mortality and favorable outcome., RESULTS: Of the 738 patients with severe TBI 159 (21.5 %) had EDH. Of these, 49 (30.8 %) died in the hospital, 21 (13.2 %) survived with unfavorable outcome, 82 (51.6 %) with favorable outcome; long-term outcome was unknown in 7 survivors (4.4 %). Mortality rates predicted by the Rotterdam score showed good correlation with observed mortality rates. According to the Hukkelhoven scores, observed/predicted ratios for mortality and unfavorable outcome were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively. Age, severity of TBI, and neurological status were the main factors influencing outcomes after severe TBI associated with EDH.

Concomitant injuries and its influence on functional outcome after traumatic brain injury.,"Leong, Be Kim; Mazlan, Mazlina; Abd Rahim, Rameezan Begam; Ganesan, Dharmendra","PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the presence and severity of extracranial concomitant injuries in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and to ascertain their effect on long-term functional outcome., METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a single-center recruiting patients with first episode of TBI. The types and severity of extracranial concomitant injuries were documented for patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Injuries with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) grade 3-6 were considered to be high grade. A cross-sectional functional assessment was conducted at 18 months post-injury using Glasgow Outcome Scale., RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in the analysis. Extracranial concomitant injuries were seen in 78% of the patients. Three commonest injuries were facial (44%), lower extremity (20%) and upper extremity (12%) injuries. Among the AIS grade >= 3, injury involving the chest was most common (41%). Presence of extracranial concomitant injuries AIS grade >= 3 was significantly associated with disability in TBI patients at 18 months (OR 12.74, 95% CI 2.39-67.95, p = 0.003)., CONCLUSION: Presence of extracranial concomitant injuries was high. In TBI survivors, extracranial concomitant injuries AIS grade >= 3 influenced the long-term functional outcome at 18 months, causing moderate and severe disabilities., IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Concomitant injuries should be suspected in patients with traumatic brain injury, especially in a high-speed trauma mechanisms as the incidence can be as high as 78% as in this study and may interfere with the long term rehabilitation and outcome. This study shows that severe extra cranial concomitant injuries are associated with a poor long term functional outcome even in the mild traumatic brain injury patients and therefore need to be addressed early in the rehabilitation of this group of patients. Early diagnosis and management of severe concomitant injuries is warranted and may improve the functional gains in the long term after traumatic brain injury.",2013,/,Disability and rehabilitation,35,18,1546-51,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09638288.2012.748832,23294408,#8422,Leong 2013,,
Multivariate outcome prediction in traumatic brain injury with focus on laboratory values.,"Nelson, David W; Rudehill, Anders; MacCallum, Robert M; Holst, Anders; Wanecek, Michael; Weitzberg, Eddie; Bellander, Bo-Michael","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Identifying factors relevant to outcome can provide a better understanding of TBI pathophysiology, in addition to aiding prognostication. Many common laboratory variables have been related to outcome but may not be independent predictors in a multivariate setting. In this study, 757 patients were identified in the Karolinska TBI database who had retrievable early laboratory variables. These were analyzed towards a dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) with logistic regression and relevance vector machines, a non-linear machine learning method, univariately and controlled for the known important predictors in TBI outcome: age, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), pupil response, and computed tomography (CT) score. Accuracy was assessed with Nagelkerke's pseudo R2. Of the 18 investigated laboratory variables, 15 were found significant (p<0.05) towards outcome in univariate analyses. In contrast, when adjusting for other predictors, few remained significant. Creatinine was found an independent predictor of TBI outcome. Glucose, albumin, and osmolarity levels were also identified as predictors, depending on analysis method. A worse outcome related to increasing osmolarity may warrant further study. Importantly, hemoglobin was not found significant when adjusted for post-resuscitation GCS as opposed to an admission GCS, and timing of GCS can thus have a major impact on conclusions. In total, laboratory variables added an additional 1.3-4.4% to pseudo R2.",2012,/,Journal of neurotrauma,29,17,2613-24,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.2468,22994879,#8637,Nelson 2012,,

In addition to admission head CT, early brain MRI was performed 12 +/- 3.9 days after injury. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess for demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, CT, and MRI features that were predictive of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 3 months postinjury., RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of MTBI patients with normal admission head CT had abnormal early brain MRI. CT evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with a multivariate odds ratio of 3.5 (p = 0.01) for poorer 3-month outcome, after adjusting for demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors.

Early Brain Edema is a Predictor of In-Hospital Mortality in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Tucker, Brian; Aston, Jill; Dines, Megan; Caraman, Elena; Yacyshyn, Marianne; McCarthy, Mary; Olson, James E","BACKGROUND: Identifying patients who may progress to a poor clinical outcome will encourage earlier appropriate therapeutic interventions. Brain edema may contribute to secondary injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and thus, may be a useful prognostic indicator., OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the presence of brain edema on the initial computed tomography (CT) scan of TBI patients would predict poor in-hospital outcome., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all trauma patients with nonpenetrating head trauma at a Level I Trauma Center. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes indicated the presence of brain edema and we evaluated the validity of this pragmatic assessment quantitatively in a random subset of patients. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome variable. Univariate analysis and logistic regression identified predictors of mortality in all TBI patients and those with mild TBI., RESULTS: Over 7200 patients were included in the study, including 6225 with mild TBI. Measurements of gray and white matter CT density verified radiological assessments of brain edema. Patients with documented brain edema had a mortality rate over 10 times that of the entire study population. With logistic regression accounting for Injury Severity Score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, other CT findings, and clinical variables, brain edema predicted an eightfold greater mortality rate in all patients (odds ratio 8.0, 95% confidence interval 4.6-14.0) and fivefold greater mortality rate for mild TBI patients (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 2.0-11.7)., CONCLUSIONS: Brain edema is an independent prognostic variable across all categories of TBI severity. By alerting emergency physicians to patients with poor predicted clinical outcomes, this finding will drive better resource allocation, earlier intervention, and reduced patient mortality.

Helsinki Computed Tomography Scoring System Can Independently Predict Long-Term Outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Yao, Shun; Song, Jian; Li, Shun; Cao, Chenglong; Fang, Li; Wang, Chaohu; Xu, Guozheng","OBJECTIVE: The Helsinki computed tomography (CT) scoring system was developed to predict long-term outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) 2 years ago; however, it has not yet been external validated. This study aimed to determine whether this system could be used as an independent predictor for TBI., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed on 302 consecutive patients with TBI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to determine the relationship between initial Helsinki CT scores and mortality and unfavorable neurologic outcome at 6 months after injury. Outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (scores of 1-3 defined as unfavorable outcome)., RESULTS: Of all patients, mortality was 17.9% and unfavorable outcome was 41.4%. The Helsinki CT score was significantly associated with the 6-month outcome in univariate analyses (P < 0.05). After adjustment for other factors in the multivariate regression analysis, the Helsinki CT score remained an independent predictor for mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.39; P = 0.002) and unfavorable outcome (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26; P = 0.007). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the Helsinki CT score possessed good discrimination ability for mortality (area under the curve, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.87; P < 0.001) and moderate discrimination ability for unfavorable outcome (area under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80; P < 0.001). Moreover, at 1.9 hours after TBI, the Helsinki CT score was most accurate for predicting mortality (accuracy, 74.5%) and unfavorable outcome (accuracy, 71.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: The Helsinki CT score showed good prognostic discrimination and can be used as an independent predictor for long-term outcome prediction in patients with TBI.

Prognostic value of corpus callosum injuries in severe head trauma.,"Cicuendez, Marta; Castano-Leon, Ana; Ramos, Ana; Hilario, Amaya; Gomez, Pedro A; Lagares, Alfonso","BACKGROUND: This study was performed to investigate the relationship between corpus callosum (CC) injury and prognosis in traumatic axonal injury (TAI)., METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed 264 patients with severe head trauma who underwent a conventional MR imaging in the first 60 days after injury. They were selected from a prospectively collected database of 1048 patients with severe head trauma admitted in our hospital. TAI lesions were defined as areas of increased signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR or areas of decreased signal on gradient-echo T2. We attempted to determine whether any MR imaging findings of TAI lesions at CC could be related to prognosis. Neurological impairment was assessed at 1 year after injury by means of GOS-E (good outcome being GOS-E 4/5 and bad outcome being GOS-E <4). We adjusted the multivariable analysis for the prognostic factors according to the IMPACT studies: the Core model (age, motor score at admission, and pupillary reactivity) and the Extended model (including CT information and second insults)., RESULTS: We found 97 patients (37 %) with TAI at CC and 167 patients (63 %) without CC lesions at MR. A total of 62 % of the patients with CC lesions had poor outcome, whereas 38 % showed good prognosis. The presence of TAI lesions at the corpus callosum was associated with poor outcome 1 year after brain trauma (p < 0.001, OR 3.8, 95 % CI: 2.04-7.06). The volume of CC lesions measured on T2 and FLAIR sequences was negatively correlated with the GOS-E after adjustment for independent prognostic factors (p = 0.01, OR 2.23, 95 % CI:1.17-4.26). Also the presence of lesions at splenium was statistically related to worse prognosis (p = 0.002, OR 8.1, 95 % CI: 2.2-29.82).

Traumatic brain injury and alcohol/substance abuse: A Bayesian meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of people with and without a history of abuse.,"Unsworth, David J; Mathias, Jane L","Alcohol and substance (drugs and/or alcohol) abuse are major risk factors for traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, it remains unclear whether outcomes differ for those with and without a history of preinjury abuse. A meta-analysis was performed to examine this issue. The PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for research that compared the neuroradiological, cognitive, or psychological outcomes of adults with and without a documented history of alcohol and/or substance abuse who sustained nonpenetrating TBIs. Data from 22 studies were analyzed using a random-effects model: Hedges's g effect sizes measured the mean difference in outcomes of individuals with/without a history of preinjury abuse, and Bayes factors assessed the probability that the outcomes differed. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse had poorer neuroradiological outcomes, including reduced hippocampal (g = -0.82) and gray matter volumes (g = -0.46 to -0.82), and enlarged cerebral ventricles (g = -0.73 to -0.80). There were limited differences in cognitive outcomes: Executive functioning (g = -0.51) and memory (g = -0.39 to -0.43) were moderately affected, but attention and reasoning were not. The findings for fine motor ability, construction, perception, general cognition, and language were inconclusive. Postinjury substance and alcohol use (g = -0.97 to -1.07) and emotional functioning (g = -0.29 to -0.44) were worse in those with a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse (psychological outcomes). This study highlighted the type and extent of post-TBI differences between persons with and without a history of alcohol or substance abuse, many of which may hamper recovery. However, variation in the criteria for premorbid abuse, limited information regarding the history of abuse, and an absence of preinjury baseline data prevented an assessment of whether the differences predated the TBI, occurred as a result of ongoing alcohol/substance abuse, or reflected the cumulative impact of alcohol/substance abuse and TBI.",2017,/,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,39,6,547-562,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13803395.2016.1248812,27829310,#6359,Unsworth 2017,,
Preinjury Use of Marijuana and Outcomes in Trauma Patients.,"Taghavi, Sharven; Ramirez, Saul; Duchesne, Juan; Tatum, Danielle","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have examined the effects of marijuana in various populations; however, there has been limited research on the effect of marijuana use in severely injured trauma patients. We hypothesized that preinjury use of marijuana would be associated with improved outcomes in severely injured trauma patients., METHODS: All adult (18+ y) level I and level II trauma activations who presented to two large regional trauma centers between 2014 and 2018 were reviewed. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)- indicated absence of drugs confirmed by testing and as THC + confirmed THC without another drug present., RESULTS: Of the 4849 patients included, 1373 (28.3%) were THC+. The THC + cohort was younger, had more males, and was more likely to be injured by penetrating mechanism (P < 0.001 for all) than THC-. THC + patients had shorter median length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (P < 0.001). Mortality rate was lower in the THC + group (4.3% versus 7.6%, P < 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis. THC + patients with traumatic brain injury had shorter hospital LOS (P = 0.025) and shorter ventilator days (P = 0.033) than THC- patients. In patients with Injury Severity Score >=16, THC + patients had significantly lower intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.009) and mortality (19.3% versus 25.0% P = 0.038) than drug-negative patients., CONCLUSIONS: Although preinjury use of marijuana does not improve survival in trauma patients, it may provide some improvement in outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury and those that are more severely injured (Injury Severity Score >=16).

Isolated severe blunt traumatic brain injury: effect of obesity on outcomes.,"Cone, Jennifer T; Benjamin, Elizabeth R; Alfson, Daniel B; Demetriades, Demetrios","OBJECTIVE: Obesity has been widely reported to confer significant morbidity and mortality in both medical and surgical patients. However, contemporary data indicate that obesity may confer protection after both critical illness and certain types of major surgery. The authors hypothesized that this ""obesity paradox"" may apply to patients with isolated severe blunt traumatic brain injuries (TBIs)., METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database was queried for patients with isolated severe blunt TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score 3-5, all other body areas AIS < 3). Patient data were divided based on WHO classification levels for BMI: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obesity class 1 (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), obesity class 2 (35.0-39.9 kg/m2), and obesity class 3 (>= 40.0 kg/m2). The role of BMI in patient outcomes was assessed using regression models., RESULTS: In total, 103,280 patients were identified with isolated severe blunt TBI. Data were excluded for patients aged < 20 or > 89 years or with BMI < 10 or > 55 kg/m2 and for patients who were transferred from another treatment center or who showed no signs of life upon presentation, leaving data from 38,446 patients for analysis. Obesity was not found to confer a survival advantage on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, underweight patients as well as obesity class 1 and 3 patients had a higher rate of mortality (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48-2.34; OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37; and OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03-1.93, respectively). Increased obesity class was associated with an increased risk of respiratory complications (obesity class 1: OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37; obesity class 2: OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.62; obesity class 3: OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18-2.05) and thromboembolic complications (overweight: OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16-1.76; obesity class 1: OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.88; obesity class 2: OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05-2.29) despite a decreased risk of overall complications (obesity class 2: OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.92; obesity class 3: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.97). Underweight patients had a significantly increased risk of overall complications (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24-1.57)., CONCLUSIONS: Although there was an obesity-associated decrease in overall complications, the study data did not demonstrate a paradoxical protective effect of obesity on mortality after isolated severe blunt TBI.

"Predictors of mortality in older patients with isolated severe head injury: a data linkage study from New South Wales, Australia.","Bath, Sally; Dinh, Michael M; Casley, Stacey; Sarrami, Pooria","Objective This study aimed to identify factors associated with 90-day mortality in older patients with a severe head injury. Methods A data linkage study was performed with the New South Wales Trauma Registry, Admitted Patient Data Collection and Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages to identify patients aged >=75 years with isolated severe head injury presenting to trauma hospitals between 2012 and 2016. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Results In all, 2045 patients were included in the analysis. The mean (+/-s.d.) age was 84.5 +/- 5.6 years. Falls accounted for 93.7% of this cohort. In-hospital mortality was 28.2% and 90-day mortality was 60.7%. Clinical variables associated with increased 90-day mortality were a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score P = 0.03) and systolic blood pressure >=180 mmHg on arrival (aOR 1.39; 95%CI 1.05-1.83; P = 0.02). The most important predictor of 90-day mortality was the presence of severe intracranial injury based on computed tomography (CT) imaging. Increasing age and comorbidities were not associated with increased mortality in this cohort. Conclusions A GCS score What is known about the topic? Older adults with severe injury generally have higher mortality, worse functional outcomes and a greater need for prolonged rehabilitation than younger people. What does this paper add? Reduced GCS score, severe hypertension on arrival and severe intracranial injury on CT were predictive of mortality after isolated severe head injury in patients aged >=75 years. There was no association between increasing age or comorbidities and mortality in this cohort. What are the implications for practitioners?

We aimed to analyze the association between sex/gender, and the broad range of care pathways, treatment characteristics, and outcomes following mild and moderate/severe TBI. We performed mixed-effects regression analyses in the prospective multi-center Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study, stratified for injury severity and age, and adjusted for baseline characteristics. Outcomes were various care pathway and treatment variables, and 6-month measures of functional outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), post-concussion symptoms (PCS), and mental health symptoms. The study included 2862 adults (36% women) with mild (mTBI; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-15), and 1333 adults (26% women) with moderate/severe TBI (GCS score 3-12). Women were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; odds ratios [OR] 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-0.8) following mTBI.

Changes and effects of plasma arginine vasopressin in traumatic brain injury,Huang W.D.; Pan J.; Xu M.; Su W.; Lu Y.Q.; Chen Z.J.; Jiang T.Y.; Yang Y.M. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common disease accompanied by chronic morbidity and mortality. The pathological mechanism and effective pharmacological treatments of TBI remain undetermined. It is suggested that AVP is involved in TBI. It is thus interesting to investigate the changes and effects of plasma AVP in clinical trials. Method(s): The serum concentrations of AVP, serum electrolytes, and serum osmolarity in a total of 23 TBI patients were dynamically monitored (on admission, Day 1, Day 3, and Day 5). Relationship between AVP and severity of brain injury and functional outcome were evaluated, respectively. Result(s): The mean AVP serum concentrations in the TBI group were significantly higher than those recorded in the control (CTRL) group on intensive care unit (ICU) admission and Day 1 (p<0.05). On Day 3 and Day 5, the differences between those groups were not significant (p>0.05). The negative correlations were found between sodium and AVP (r=-0.35; p<0.05) and between osmolarity and AVP (r=-0.42; p<0.05). In poor outcome group, the mean AVP serum concentrations were significantly higher than in good outcome group and CTRL group (p<0.05). A statistically significant correlation was also found between AVP on ICU admission and the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (r=0.47; p<0.05). Conclusion(s): We suggest that AVP is involved in the pathophysiology process of secondary brain damage after TBI. It seems that AVP antagonist is a promising target for the treatment of TBI, while further studies should be carried out. © 2008, Editrice Kurtis.",2008,/,Journal of Endocrinological Investigation,31,11,996-1000,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03345638,354160806,#24933,Huang 2008,Steven Qiu (2022-04-21 05:30:57)(Screen): Probably doesn't have any sub analysis of AVP within the TBI group but will include just in case; ,
Multimodal early rehabilitation and predictors of outcome in survivors of severe traumatic brain injury,Choi J.H.; Jakob M.; Stapf C.; Marshall R.S.; Hartmann A.; Mast H. ,"BACKGROUND:: To determine the effect of brain lesion pattern on early recovery after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHOD(S):: In a setting of a multimodal early rehabilitation unit at a level I trauma center, 135 consecutive survivors of severe TBI (mean age, 40 years, 25% women) were studied prospectively. Assessment of disability was performed weekly using an extended Barthel Index (eBI) ranging from g'325 to +100 points. Clinical and brain morphologic variables were tested in multivariate logistic regression models to determine predictors of outcome. RESULT(S):: Imaging revealed cerebral contusion in 115 patients (85%) affecting the frontal (n <= 80), temporal (n <= 62), parieto-occipital (n <= 17), brain stem (n <= 13), and cerebellar (n <= 5) regions. In addition, 80 patients (59%) showed diffuse brain edema, 75 (55%) subarachnoid, 37 (28%) subdural, and 18 (13%) epidural hemorrhage. After a mean stay of 72 +/- 51 days in the early rehabilitation unit, one patient died, 40 (30%) revealed good outcome (median eBI, +55), and a further 43 patients (32%) showed excellent outcomes (eBI, 90-100). Temporal (odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.1-6.5) and brain stem contusions (odds ratio 13.8; 95% confidence interval 3.0-64.1) were independent predictors of poor outcome. CONCLUSION(S):: Temporal and brain stem contusions constitute independent risk factors for poor outcome in survivors of severe TBI. The results further suggest a high potential for multimodal early rehabilitation after severe TBI. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2008,/,"Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care",65,5,1028-1035,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31815eba9b,354927395,#24858,Choi 2008,,

Outcome Prediction of TBI: Are There Parameters That Affect the IMPACT and CRASH Models?.,"Bilgi, Kanchan; Gopalakrishna, Kadarapura Nanjundaiah; Chakrabarti, Dhritiman; Rao, G S Umamaheswara","BACKGROUND: Abnormal hematologic parameters associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been studied in isolation. We aimed to study whether there are any additional parameters that improve standard prognostic models in TBI., METHODS: This prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary neurological care center included adult patients with moderate and severe isolated head injury. Laboratory and clinical parameters were noted at admission, and the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended of patients was assessed after 6 months. Multiple logistic regression was conducted using fixed coefficients of IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury) prognostic models. The new composite models were compared with the original models., RESULTS: The study comprised 96 patients. Parameters with relatively good predictability for mortality were elevated international normalized ratio (area under the curve [AUC] 0.69, odds ratio 13.2), total leukocyte count (AUC 0.68, odds ratio 1.15), and transfusion of blood products (AUC 0.72, odds ratio 6.43). Addition of these led to a statistically small improvement in predictions of IMPACT and CRASH. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was not a good predictor of mortality or morbidity (AUC 0.58 and 0.47, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: International normalized ratio, total leukocyte count, and blood transfusion were found to be predictors of mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome in TBI at 6 months. Their addition to the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic models resulted in a modest improvement in the prediction of outcome in TBI. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to identify predictors of and develop prognostic models for HRQoL following TBI., METHODS: We used data from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) Core study, including patients with a clinical diagnosis of TBI and an indication for computed tomography presenting within 24 h of injury. The primary outcome measures were the SF-36v2 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health component summary scores and the Quality of Life after Traumatic Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) total score 6 months post injury. We considered 16 patient and injury characteristics in linear regression analyses. Model performance was expressed as proportion of variance explained (R2) and corrected for optimism with bootstrap procedures., RESULTS: 2666 Adult patients completed the HRQoL questionnaires. Most were mild TBI patients (74%). The strongest predictors for PCS were Glasgow Coma Scale, major extracranial injury, and pre-injury health status, while MCS and QOLIBRI were mainly related to pre-injury mental health problems, level of education, and type of employment. R2 of the full models was 19% for PCS, 9% for MCS, and 13% for the QOLIBRI. In a subset of patients following predominantly mild TBI (N = 436), including 2 week HRQoL assessment improved model performance substantially (R2 PCS 15% to 37%, MCS 12% to 36%, and QOLIBRI 10% to 48%)., CONCLUSION: Medical and injury-related characteristics are of greatest importance for the prediction of PCS, whereas patient-related characteristics are more important for the prediction of MCS and the QOLIBRI following TBI.

"Functional outcome 10 years after traumatic brain injury: Its relationship with demographic, injury severity, and cognitive and emotional status",Ponsford J.; Draper K.; Schonberger M. ,"Previous investigations of long-term outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI) have yielded mixed results regarding the predictive power of injury severity and demographic factors. Furthermore, there has been limited investigation of the association between long-term outcome and current cognitive functioning and psychiatric state. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of injury severity, demographic factors, and concurrent cognitive and psychiatric functioning with functional outcome 10 years following mild to severe TBI. Outcome was rated using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) for 60 participants, who also completed neuropsychological measures of attention, speed of processing, memory and executive function and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Outcome on the GOSE ranged from upper good recovery (32%) to lower severe disability (2%).

Prognosis of the outcome following severe close craniocerebral injury,Nikoloc R.M.; Mijajlovic M.Z.; Nikolic D.R.; Nikolic V.B.; Peulic M.S.; Lukic S.M. ,"We describe the parameters that can influence the outcome of severe closed craniocerebral injury. Craniocerebral injuries involve two phases: the phase of primary injury, which includes primary cerebral lesions made under the influence of factors that have a direct or indirect impact on the cranium, and the phase that represents secondary injuries, which are the result of the impact of pathophysiological mechanisms (hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypotension). These mechanisms are initiated by a trauma as well as some specific characteristics of the organism (e.g., age, comorbid conditions, and previous injuries). The aim of the study was to establish factors that significantly influence the outcome after severe closed craniocerebral injury. A total of 182 patients that were treated at the Clinical Center in Kragujevac from 2001 to 2005 were included. The most important prognostic factors for the treatment outcome were: age, oxygen saturation, the Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) and level of injury of the cerebral tissue diagnosed by a CT. Morbidity risk raised by 2.6% when only the age parameter increased by one year. When evaluating a 1% increase in oxygen saturation, the morbidity risk rate fell for 10.7% of the patients if other parameters remained stable. According to the aforementioned criteria, a 159.3% increase in morbidity risk rate was observed between mild and severe brain injury when other parameters did not change. In conclusion, a severe closed cerebrocranial injury is a dominant factor for the determination of patient outcome.",2008,/,Serbian Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research,9,3,105-110,,,354370165,#24922,Nikoloc 2008,,

Aim(s): To assess the prognostic significance of admission serum albumin levels in patients of head injury. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospective cohort study with control group. Within 24 hours of head injury, 154 patients underwent serum analysis for albumin along with 38 normal volunteers, studied in relation to various factors and subsequently followed-up. Statistical analysis was made with SPSS software, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Mean serum albumin in head injury and control were 3.24 and 4.15 g/dL respectively (p < 0.001). Admission albumin had significant positive correlation with Glasgow coma score (GCS) (p < 0.001). Hypoalbuminemia (<= 3.5 g/dL) at admission was noted in 88%, 52% and 33% of patients with severe, moderate and mild head injury respectively (p < 0.001). Significantly lower albumin levels were observed in patients with associated systemic injury; those requiring surgical decompression and in the elderly.

Outcome in patients with blunt head trauma and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 at presentation: Clinical article,Chamoun R.B.; Robertson C.S.; Gopinath S.P. ,"Object. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 on presentation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury due to blunt trauma has been recognized as a bad prognostic factor. The reported mortality rate in these patients is very high, even approaching 100% in the presence of fixed and dilated pupils in some series. Consequently, there is often a tendency to treat these patients less aggressively because of the low expectations for a good recovery. In this paper, the authors' purpose is to report their experience in the management of this patient population, analyzing the mortality rate, prognostic factors, and functional outcome of survivors. Methods. The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who presented between 1997 and 2007 with blunt head trauma and a GCS score of 3. Demographics, mechanism of injury, examination, blood alcohol level, associated injury, intracranial pressure (ICP), surgical procedures, and outcome were all recorded. Results. A total of 189 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The overall mortality rate was 49.2%. At the 6-month follow-up, 13.2% of the entire series achieved a good functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score of 1 or 2). The patient population was then divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (patients who survived [96]) and Group 2 (patients who died [93]). Patients in Group 1 were younger (mean 33.3 +/- 12.8 vs 40.3 +/- 16.97 years; p = 0.002) and had lower ICP on admission (mean 16.3 +/- 11.1 vs 25.7 +/- 12.7 mm Hg; p < 0.001) than those in Group 2. The difference between the 2 groups regarding sex, mechanism of injury, hypotension on admission, alcohol, surgery, and associated injuries was not statistically significant. The presence of bilateral fixed, dilated pupils was found to be associated with the highest mortality rate (79.7%). Although not statistically significant because of the sample size, pupil status was also a good predictor of the functional outcome at the 6-month follow-up; a good functional outcome (GOS Score 1 or 2) was achieved in 25.5% of patients presenting with bilateral reactive pupils, and 27.6% of patients presenting with a unilateral fixed, dilated pupil, compared with 7.5% for those presenting with bilateral fixed, nondilated pupils, and 1.4% for patients with bilateral fixed, dilated pupils. Conclusions. Overall, 50.8% of patients survived their injury and 13.2% achieved a good functional outcome afterat 6 months of follow-up (GOS Score 1 or 2). Age, ICP on admission, and pupil status were found to be significant predictive factors of outcome. In particular, pupil size and reactivity appeared to be the most important prognostic factor since the mortality rate was 23.5% in the presence of bilateral reactive pupils and 79.7% in the case of bilateral fixed, dilated pupils. The authors believe that patients having suffered traumatic brain injury and present with a GCS score of 3 should still be treated aggressively initially since a good functional outcome can be obtained in some cases.",2009,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,111,4,683-687,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2009.2.JNS08817,355420410,#24761,Chamoun 2009,,
Personal Factors Associated With Postconcussion Symptoms 3 Months After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Skandsen, Toril; Stenberg, Jonas; Follestad, Turid; Karaliute, Migle; Saksvik, Simen B; Einarsen, Cathrine E; Lillehaug, Hanna; Haberg, Asta K; Vik, Anne; Olsen, Alexander; Iverson, Grant L","OBJECTIVE: To describe personal factors in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and 2 control groups and to explore how such factors were associated with postconcussion symptoms (PCSs)., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SETTING: Level 1 trauma center and outpatient clinic., PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=541) included patients with MTBI (n=378), trauma controls (n=82), and community controls (n=81)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on preinjury health and work status, personality, resilience, attention deficit/hyperactivity, and substance use. Computed tomography (CT) findings and posttraumatic amnesia were recorded. Symptoms were assessed at 3 months with the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory and labeled as PCS+ if >=3 symptoms were reported or the total score was >=13. Predictive models were fitted with penalized logistic regression using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) in the MTBI group, and model fit was assessed with optimism-corrected area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve., RESULTS: There were few differences in personal factors between the MTBI group and the 2 control groups without MTBI. Rates of PCS+ were 20.8% for the MTBI group, 8.0% for trauma controls, and 1.3% for community controls. In the MTBI group, there were differences between the PCS+ and PCS- group on most personal factors and injury-related variables in univariable comparisons. In the lasso models, the optimism-corrected AUC for the full model was 0.79, 0.73 for the model only including personal factors, and 0.63 for the model only including injury variables. Working less than full time before injury, having preinjury pain and poor sleep quality, and being female were among the selected predictors, but also resilience and some personality traits contributed in the model. Intracranial abnormalities on CT were also a risk factor for PCS., CONCLUSIONS: Personal factors convey important prognostic information in patients with MTBI.

S100B is an important outcome predictor in traumatic brain injury.,"Thelin, Eric Peter; Johannesson, Louise; Nelson, David; Bellander, Bo-Michael","The objective of the study was to examine how S100B, a biomarker of traumatic brain injury (TBI), contributes to outcome prediction after adjusting for known parameters, including age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil reaction, and computed tomography (CT) variables; to examine which parameters have the best correlation to elevated serum levels of S100B; and to investigate when to sample S100B to achieve the strongest association to outcome. This retrospective study included 265 patients with TBI admitted to the neurointensive care unit, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. Univariate and multivariate proportional odds regressions were performed to determine parameters most closely related to outcome, and how S100B adds to prediction accuracy. Age (p<0.0001), pupil reaction (p<0.0001), and levels of S100B (p<0.0001) had the strongest statistical correlation to outcome. The area under curve of S100B, the first 48 h after trauma, yielded an additional explained variance of 6.6% in excess of known outcome parameters, including age, GCS, pupil reaction, and CT variables, themselves exhibiting an explained variance of 29.3%. S100B adds substantial information regarding patient outcome, in excess of that provided by known parameters. Only CT variables were found to be significant predictors of increased levels of S100B in uni- and multivariate analysis. Early samples of S100B, within 12 h after trauma, appear to have little prognostic value, and S100B should likely be sampled 12-36 h following trauma to best enhance TBI outcome prediction.",2013,/,Journal of neurotrauma,30,7,519-28,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.2553,23297751,#8419,Thelin 2013,,
Association of Serum Uric Acid Level with the Severity of Brain Injury and Patient's Outcome in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Hatefi, Masoud; Dastjerdi, Masoud Moghadas; Ghiasi, Bahareh; Rahmani, Asghar","INTRODUCTION: The prognostic value of serum Uric Acid (UA) levels in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is unclear., AIM: To investigate the relationship between serum UA levels and prognosis of patients with TBI when in hospital and at six months after discharge., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients attended our emergency department during July 2014 and December 2015 and were consecutively entered into the study and among 890 evaluated candidates based on inclusion criteria we finally investigated the serum UA levels of 725 TBI patients. Computed Tomography (CT) images of the brain were obtained within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge and at six months after discharge., RESULTS: Data of 725 patients (42.89% men; mean age: 54.69+/-12.37 years) were analyzed. Mean+/-Standard Deviation (SD) of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores was 4.65+/-1.76. Serum levels of UA, when in hospital and at six months after discharge, among those who died were lower than those who survived (in hospital: 0.126+/-0.026 vs. 0.243+/-0.942 mmol/l, p = 0.000; 6 months post-discharge: 0.130+/-0.044 vs. 0.286+/-0.069 mmol/l, p<0.001).

High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein: Retrospective Study of Potential Blood Biomarker of Inflammation in Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Shetty, Teena; Cogsil, Taylor; Dalal, Aashka; Kim, Esther; Halvorsen, Kristin; Cummings, Kelianne; Nguyen, Joseph T","OBJECTIVE: A panel of biomarkers is needed to definitively diagnose mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). There is a clear role for the inclusion of an inflammatory biomarker. This study looked to find a relationship between high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), an inflammatory biomarker, and mTBI., SETTING: Neurology department of high-volume tertiary orthopedic hospital., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals diagnosed with mTBI (n = 311, age 21 +/- 12 years, 53% female)., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., MAIN MEASURES: hsCRP levels; postconcussive symptoms; demographics., RESULTS: Continuous hsCRP levels were transformed into quartiles, as defined by less than 0.200 mg/L for quartile 1 (Q1); 0.200 to 0.415 mg/L for quartile 2 (Q2); 0.415 to 1.100 mg/L for quartile 3 (Q3); and greater than 1.100 mg/L for quartile 4 (Q4). Mean hsCRP was elevated in the cohort of individuals who presented within 1 week of injury and was found to significantly decrease between the first visit and 4 weeks postinjury (P = .016). Initial hsCRP level was positively correlated with age (r = 0.163, P = .004), and age significantly increased between quartiles (P = .013). Patients with increased age (odds ratio: 3.48) and those who endorsed headache (odds ratio: 3.48) or fatigue (odds ratio: 2.16) were significantly associated with increased risk of having an hsCRP level in Q4., CONCLUSION: hsCRP may be a viable addition to acute and longitudinal biomarker panels for diagnosis and prognosis of mTBI.",2019,/,The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation,34,3,E28-E36,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000450,30499931,#5372,Shetty 2019,,
Role of S100B protein in urine and serum as an early predictor of mortality after severe traumatic brain injury in adults.,"Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Ana; Egea-Guerrero, Juan Jose; Leon-Justel, Antonio; Gordillo-Escobar, Elena; Revuelto-Rey, Jaume; Vilches-Arenas, Angel; Carrillo-Vico, Antonio; Dominguez-Roldan, Jose Maria; Murillo-Cabezas, Francisco; Guerrero, Juan Miguel","S100B is a calcium-binding protein released into the blood from astroglial cells due to brain injury. Some authors have described a correlation between S100B serum concentration and severity of brain damage. There is not much information about the accuracy of urinary S100B for predicting outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). 55 patients with severe TBI were included in the study. Blood and urine samples were drawn to determine S100B levels on admission and on the subsequent 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. S100B concentrations (serum and urine) were significantly higher in patients who were dead a month after the accident compared to survivors. ROC-analysis showed that S100B at 24h post-severe TBI is a useful tool for predicting mortality (serum: AUC 0.958, urine: AUC 0.778). The best cut-offs for S100B were 0.461 mug/L and 0.025 mug/L (serum and urine respectively), with a sensitivity of 90% for both measurements and a specificity of 88.4% (serum) and 62.8% (urine). We can state that the determination of S100B levels both in urine and serum acts as a sensitive and an effective biomarker for the early prediction of mortality after severe TBI.

Mortality and long-term functional outcome associated with intracranial pressure after traumatic brain injury.,"Badri, Shide; Chen, Jasper; Barber, Jason; Temkin, Nancy R; Dikmen, Sureyya S; Chesnut, Randall M; Deem, Steven; Yanez, N David; Treggiari, Miriam M","PURPOSE: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) has been associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have examined whether raised ICP is independently associated with mortality, functional status and neuropsychological functioning in adult TBI patients., METHODS: Data from a randomized trial of 499 participants were secondarily analyzed. The primary endpoints were mortality and a composite measure of functional status and neuropsychological function (memory, speed of information processing, executive function) over a 6-month period. The area under the curve of the ICP profile (average ICP) during the first 48 h of monitoring was the main predictor of interest. Multivariable regression was used to adjust for a priori defined confounders: age, Glasgow Coma Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale-head and hypoxia., RESULTS: Of the participants, 365 patients had complete 48-h ICP data. The overall 6-month mortality was 18 %. The adjusted odds ratio of mortality comparing 10-mmHg increases in average ICP was 3.12 (95 % confidence interval 1.79, 5.44; p < 0.01). Overall, higher average ICP was associated with decreased functional status and neuropsychological functioning (p < 0.01). Importantly, among survivors, increasing average ICP was not independently associated with worse performance on neuropsychological testing (p = 0.46)., CONCLUSIONS: Average ICP in the first 48 h of monitoring was an independent predictor of mortality and of a composite endpoint of functional and neuropsychological outcome at the 6-month follow-up in moderate or severe TBI patients.

The aim of our study is to describe the incidence of non-neurological organ dysfunction (NNOD) and its impact on outcomes in patients with severe TBI admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU)., METHODS: We performed a 3-year (2015-2017) review of our Level 1 trauma center's prospectively maintained TBI database and included all adult (age >=18y) patients with isolated severe TBI (head abbreviated injury severity (AIS) >=3 and other AIS <3) and an ICU stay >48 hours. Organ dysfunction (OD) was measured by multiple organ dysfunction scores. Organ system failure was defined as a non-neurological component score of >=3 on any day during the ICU stay. Outcomes measured were the incidence of NNOD and its effect on outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis was performed., RESULTS: A total of 285 patients were included. The mean age was 48 +/- 22 years, 72% were males, median [IQR] Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 8[5-10], and median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 17[10-26]. Epidural hematoma was the most common intracranial hemorrhage (49%) followed by subdural hematoma (46%). The overall incidence of NNOD was 33%, with the most common dysfunctional organ system being the respiratory (23%) followed by the cardiovascular (12%) and hepatic system (8%). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 19% (NNOD:36% vs. No-NNOD:9%, p< 0.01).

We hypothesized that coagulation/fibrinolytic abnormalities are more pronounced in older patients and may be a factor in poorer outcomes. We retrospectively evaluated severe TBI cases in which fibrinogen and D-dimer were measured on arrival and 3-6 h after injury. Propensity score-matched analyses were performed to adjust baseline characteristics between older patients (the ""elderly group,"" aged >=75 y) and younger patients (the ""non-elderly group,"" aged 16-74 y).

Long-Term Analysis of Functional Outcomes in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients.,"Schroeppel, Thomas J; Sharpe, John P; Melendez, Claudia I; Jepson, Brian; Dunn, Rebekah; Paige Clement, L; Khan, Abid D; Croce, Martin A; Fabian, Timothy C","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to examine outcomes after discharge and identify factors from the index admission that may contribute to long-term mortality., METHODS: The study population is composed of patients who survived to discharge from a previously published study examining TBI. Demographics, injury severity, and length of stay were abstracted from the index study. Phone surveys of surviving patients were performed to evaluate each patient's Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Patients who were deceased at the time of the survey were compared with those who were alive., RESULTS: 1615 patients were alive at the end of the first study period and 211 (13%) comprised the study population. Overall, the median age was 54 years, and the majority were male (74%). The median time to follow-up was 80 months. The population was severely injured, with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 25 and a median head abbreviated injury score (AIS) of 4. Overall mortality was 57%. The group that survived at the time of the survey was younger, more injured, less likely to have received beta-blockers (BB) during the index admission, and had a longer time to follow-up. After adjusting for ISS, age, base deficit, and BB, age was the only variable predictive of mortality (HR 1.03; HL 1.02-1.04)., CONCLUSION: Despite being more severely injured, younger patients were more likely to survive to follow-up.

The predictive value of RDW in AKI and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Wang, Ruo Ran; He, Min; Ou, Xiao Feng; Xie, Xiao Qi; Kang, Yan","BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been validated valuable in predicting outcome and acute kidney injury (AKI) in several clinical settings. The aim of this study was to explore whether RDW is associated with outcome and AKI in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Patients admitted to our hospital for TBI from January 2015 to August 2018 were included in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors of AKI and outcome in patients with TBI. The value of RDW in predicting AKI and outcome was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve., RESULTS: Three hundred and eighteen patients were included in this study. The median of RDW was 14.25%. We divided subjects into two groups based on the median and compared difference of variables between two groups. The incidence of AKI and mortality was higher in high RDW (RDW > 14.25) group (31.45% vs 9.43%, P < .001; 69.81% vs 29.56%, P < .001). Spearman's method showed RDW was moderately associated with 90-day Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) (P < .001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RDW, lymphocyte, chlorine, and serum creatinine were risk factors of AKI. And Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), glucose, chlorine, AKI, and RDW were risk factors of mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RDW for predicting AKI and mortality was 0.724 (0.662-0.786) and 0.754 (0.701-0.807), respectively. Patients with higher RDW were likely to have shorter median survival time (58 vs 70, P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Red blood cell distribution width is an independent risk factor of AKI and mortality in patients with TBI.

Lactate can also be used as alternative cerebral fuel and it is involved in regulating cerebral blood flow. This study explored the relation of endogenous arterial lactate to systemic physiology, pressure autoregulation, cerebral energy metabolism, and clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHOD: A retrospective study including 115 patients (consent given) with severe TBI treated in the neurointensive care unit, Uppsala university hospital, Sweden, 2008-2018. Data from cerebral microdialysis, arterial blood gases, hemodynamics and intracranial pressure were analyzed the first ten days post-injury., RESULTS: Arterial lactate peaked on day 1 post-injury (mean 1.7 +/- 0.7 mM) and gradually decreased. Higher arterial lactate correlated with lower age (p-value < 0.05), higher Marshall score (p-value < 0.05) and higher arterial glucose (p-value < 0.001) in a multiple regression analysis.

S100b as a prognostic biomarker in outcome prediction for patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Goyal, Akash; Failla, Michelle D; Niyonkuru, Christian; Amin, Krutika; Fabio, Anthony; Berger, Rachel P; Wagner, Amy K","As an astrocytic protein specific to the central nervous system, S100b is a potentially useful marker in outcome prediction after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Some studies have questioned the validity of S100b, citing the extracerebral origins of the protein as reducing the specificity of the marker. This study evaluated S100b as a prognostic biomarker in adult subjects with severe TBI (sTBI) by comparing outcomes with S100b temporal profiles generated from both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 138 subjects) and serum (n = 80 subjects) samples across a 6-day time course. Long-bone fracture, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and isolated head injury status were variables used to assess extracerebral sources of S100b in serum. After TBI, CSF and serum S100b levels were increased over healthy controls across the first 6 days post-TBI (p <= 0.005 and p <= 0.031). Though CSF and serum levels were highly correlated during early time points post-TBI, this association diminished over time. Bivariate analysis showed that subjects who had temporal CSF profiles with higher S100b concentrations had higher acute mortality (p < 0.001) and worse Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS; p = 0.002) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores (p = 0.039) 6 months post-injury. Possibly as a result of extracerebral sources of S100b in serum, as represented by high ISS scores (p = 0.032), temporal serum profiles were associated with acute mortality (p = 0.015). High CSF S100b levels were observed in women (p = 0.022) and older subjects (p = 0.004).

This study aimed to evaluate a relationship between reduced pH(bt) and disturbances of cerebral metabolism. Prospective data from 56 patients with TBI, receiving microdialysis and Neurotrend monitoring, were analyzed. Four tissue states were defined based on pH(bt) and P(bt)O(2): 1--low P(bt)O(2)/pH(bt), 2--low pH(bt)/normal P(bt)O(2), 3--normal pH(bt)/low P(bt)O(2), and 4--normal pH(bt)/P(bt)O(2)). Microdialysis values were compared between the groups. The relationship between P(bt)O(2) and lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio was evaluated at different pH(bt) levels. Proportional contribution of each state was evaluated against mortality. As compared with the state 4, the state 3 was not different, the state 2 exhibited higher levels of lactate, LP, and glucose and the state 1--higher LP and reduced glucose (P<0.001).

Cerebrospinal fluid nitric oxide metabolite levels as a biomarker in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Kandasamy, Regunath; Kanti Pal, Hillol; Swamy, Mummedy; Abdullah, Jafri","Nitric oxide has a definitive role in the complex pathophysiology of traumatc brain injury (TBI). This prospective cohort study investigated the changes in nitric oxide metabolite (NOx) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and their correlation with factors associated with severity and prognosis after severe TBI. NOx levels were measured in CSF obtained via ventriculostomy in 44 adult patients admitted after severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8/15). The overall mean level of CSF NOx in the study population was 7.40 +/- 1.59 mumol/L. Levels of CSF NOx were found to be significantly higher in subgroups of patients with poorer outcome measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale score (p < 0.042), in patients with high intracranial pressure (ICP) readings (p < 0.027) and in those with higher Marshall computed tomography (CT) grading scores (p < 0.026). Simple logistic regression demonstrated that CSF NOx levels were a significant predictor of ICP (b = 0.493, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.58, p = 0.033). A patient with 1 mumol/L increase in NOx level had 1.6 times the odds to have an ICP >= 20 mmHg when other confounders were not adjusted.

Model performance was evaluated based on calibration (graphically and characterized by slope and intercept) and discrimination (C-index). We validated five published models for 6-month GOSE and three for 6-month PPCS scores. The models used different cutoffs for outcome and some included symptoms measured 2 weeks post-injury. Discriminative ability varied substantially (C-index between 0.58 and 0.79). The models developed in the Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) trial for prediction of GOSE <5 discriminated best (C-index 0.78 and 0.79), but were poorly calibrated. The best performing models for PPCS included 2-week symptoms (C-index 0.75 and 0.76). In conclusion, none of the prognostic models for early prediction of GOSE and PPCS has both good calibration and discrimination in persons with mild TBI. In future studies, prognostic models should be tailored to the population with mild TBI, predicting relevant end-points based on readily available predictors.",2021,/,Journal of neurotrauma,38,2,196-209,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7074,32977737,#4471,Mikolic 2021,,
[Prognostic factors in severe traumatic brain injury].,"Frutos Bernal, E; Rubio Gil, F J; Martin Corral, J C; Marcos Prieto, L A; Gonzalez Robledo, J","OBJECTIVE: To describe the factors associated to mortality of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was made of patients with severe TBI covering the period between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2010., SETTING: Virgen de la Vega Hospital, Salamanca (Spain)., PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized during the consecutive study period., MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: The dependent variable has been the death rate, while the independent variables were divided into two groups: epidemiological and clinical., RESULTS: The mean patient age was the 50.84 years; 75.5% were males. The average score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 5.09, and the average Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 30.8. Higher mortality was observed in older patients with a higher ISS score. A total of 68.1% of the patients in which intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored showed intracranial hypertension (ICH). The mortality rate in patients with severe TBI was 36.8%, and was associated mainly to a lower GCS score, the existence of hyperglycemia, coagulopathy, hypoxemia, the presence of mydriasis and shock. The independent mortality indicators in patients with severe TBI were the existence of mydriasis (OR: 32.75), the GCS score (OR: 2.65) and hyperglycemia (OR: 6.08)., CONCLUSIONS: The existence of mydriasis, the GCS score and hyperglycemia should be taken into account as prognostic factors in TBI patients.

Prehospital endotracheal intubation does not associate with outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Franschman G.; Peerdeman S.M.; Andriessen T.M.J.C.; Greuters S.; Jukema G.N.; Loer S.A.; Boer C. ,"The prognosis of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have the lowest Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) relies on suitable support of respiratory function. Adequate prehospital respiratory management includes e.g. endotracheal intubation and normoventilation, and is strongly associated with improved outcome in these patients. We recently found that not all patients with a GCS <=8 are intubated, despite the recommendations of international guidelines. Here we investigated whether endotracheal intubation is an independent predictor of outcome in TBI patients in addition to classical prognostic parameters like age, pupil reflex, GCS value, CT scan score at admission and the incidence of hypotension in the prehospital period. The medical files of 340 TBI patients with a GCS <=8 who were admitted to the emergency room of two level 1 trauma centers (Amsterdam and Nijmegen, the Netherlands) were analyzed in a retrospective fashion. Patients aged 44x21 years and were typically male (70%). The median Injury Severity Score estimated 29 and 70% of all patients were intubated in the prehospital phase. Actual and predicted (CRASH score) mortality approximated 43% and 50%, respectively. Of all survivors with a reported Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE; n = 149), only 38 patients made a good recovery after trauma. Regression analysis revealed that mortality was strongly associated with increased age, the prehospital incidence of hypotension and a disturbed pupil reflex (all P< 0.001), but not with hypoxia, the GCS value, the CT score or the presence of a tube. Moreover, post-traumatic development of disabilities in survivors was significantly associated with age, a disturbed pupil reflex at the trauma scene and the severity of brain lesions as detected by CT analysis in the first hour after hospital admission. Neither intubation nor hypoxia is an independent outcome predictor in our severe brain injury population. Our data show that pupil reflex, age and the incidence of hypotension are predictors of mortality in TBI patients with the lowest GCS values, whereas worse CT classification is associated with an unfavorable outcome in TBI survivors. These results should be placed into the light of the Netherlands, which is a wealthy nation and comprises a high density of population with a secure infrastructure for prehospital care of TBI victims. Our results warrant for a prospective investigation of the role of intubation in the outcome of TBI patients.",2009,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,26,8,A90,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.9953,70001783,#24693,Franschman 2009,,
BCL-2 and cytochrome c as prognostic markers of TBI outcome,Amin K.; Rogers E.; Ozawa H.; Niyonkuru C.; Postal B.; Dixon C.E.; Fabio A.; Wagner A. ,"Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) cascades involves both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins. Previous research suggests elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of bcl-2 and cytochrome c (Cyto-C) in adults with severe TBI are reflective of ongoing cellular injury post-TB I. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CSF levels and trajectories of bcl-2 and cytochrome c in adult patients following severe TBI in relation to demographic variables, injury severity, and outcome. Bcl-2 and cytochrome c was measured 0-144 hours post-injury (N = 88) and compare to healthy controls. Group-based trajectory analysis (TRAJ) was used to describe trends of biomarker change over time, and bivariate analysis was used to evaluate different patterns of biomarker change specific for age, gender, injury type and severity, and outcome. Ordinal logistic multivariate regression models were developed to evaluate how trajectory groups affect TBI outcome. Both Cyto-C and BCL-2 levels were elevated above control values. TRAJ generated 3 group profiles to characterize both Bcl-2 and Cyto-C across the first 144 hours post-injury. Bivariate analysis shows that subjects with consistently the highest levels BCL-2 and Cyto-C levels display worse outcome at 6 months post-injury as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) (BCL-2: GOS 6 and 12 months p = 0.008, DRS 6 months p = 0.008, 12 months p = 0.003; Cyto-C: GOS 6months p = 0.045, 12 month p = 0.023; DRS 6 months p = 0.014, 12 months p = 0.0016). In multivariate analysis, worse outcome at 6 months was associated with consistently elevated BCL-2 trajectory (GOS p = 0.0013, DRS p = 0.003), older age (GOS p = 0.005, DRS p = 0.023), and more severe injury (GOS p = 0.01, DRS p = 0.006). Better outcome on the DRS was associated with Cyto-C trajectories which are not consistently elevated (p = 0.005 and p = 0.009) and younger age (p = 0.006). Results indicate that BCL-2 and Cyto-C levels over time can be separated into unique trajectory groups which are related to outcome. Consistently elevated levels of BCL-2 and Cyto-C are associated with worse outcome post-injury. Future work will be required to determine the interrelationship of BCL-2 and Cyto-C as associated with demographic variables, injury severity and outcome post-TBI and to validate findings in additional populations.",2009,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,26,8,A71,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.9953,70001713,#24694,Amin 2009,,
Prognosis factors related to a better outcome in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury,Monje M.J.G.; Farina M.M.; Cortes P.V.; Fernandez V.A.; Besteiro G.B.; Galeiras R.; Benavent J.P.; Moar D.F.; Jimenez P. ,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prognosis factors related to a better outcome in patients with moderate and severe brain traumatic injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study made in a University Hospital Intensive Care Unit from January 2007 to March 2009. Patients older than 18 years old, with a moderate or severe head injury were included. Head injury severity was score based on initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and computerized tomography (CT) findings by the National Coma Data Bank (NCDB) scale. Epidemiology data and potential risk factors were collected. To evaluate the functional outcome a telephone interview was made, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULT(S): 83 patients were included, being 15 patients missed on the following process. 75% were men, median age 45.5 (SD 22.4) and initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 7 (SD 3.1). Based on CT finding patients present a NCDB score median of 3 (1.5). 30.9% had major trauma lesions associated and 16.2% required emergency surgery. For medical treatment 52.9% received neuromuscular blocking agents, 44.1% hyperosmolar therapy and 4.4% barbiturate; 39.7% were hyperventilated, and 7.4% required a decompressive craniectomy. 38.2% had blood transfusions. Injury location was frontal in 22.1%, temporal in 5.9%, occipital in 13.8%, diffuse in 26.2% and multiple contusions in 30.7%. Hyperthermia was present in 48.5% patients and hyperglycemias in 7.4%. Complications: 1 - Infectious diseases: ventrICUlitis 17.6%, ventilator associated pneumonia 14.7% and urinary infection 13.2%. 2 - Respiratory diseases: ARDS 8.8% and pulmonary oedema 1.5%. 3 - Neurological: ischemia 1.5% and bleeding 1.5%. Discharge GCS was 14.0 (SD 3.1) and GOS 3.0 (SD 1.3). ICU length of stay (LOS) was 15.5 days (SD 11.7) and hospital LOS 24 days (SD 82.5). ICU mortality was 19.1%. Six months GOS was 4.0 (SD 1.7) and six months mRS 2.0 (SD 2.4). Analysing by unvaried analysis we found as prognosis factor related to six months GOS the followings factors: age (p < 0.001), gender (p: 0.002), APACHE II score (p < 0.001), NCDB score (p: 0.004), major trauma injuries (p: 0.042), seizures onset (p: 0.002), hyperosmolar therapy (p: 0.038), hyperthermia (p: 0.05) and hyperglycemias (p: 0.002). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (p: 0.008) and APACHE II score (p: 0.039) were independent risk factors. CONCLUSION(S): The most significant prognosis factors related to outcome are age and APACHE II score in the first 24 h. CT findings classified by the NCDB scale have determined to be a good outcome predictor. Young people and male seem to have better outcome. Patients who presented hyperthermia or hyperglycemias during the ICU stay and those who need to be treated with hyperosmolar therapy are related with a worse outcome.",2009,/,Intensive Care Medicine,35,Suppl. 1,S251,,,70191190,#24680,Monje 2009,,
Plasma micro-RNA biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis after traumatic brain injury: A pilot study.,"Mitra, Biswadev; Rau, Thomas F; Surendran, Nanda; Brennan, James H; Thaveenthiran, Prasanthan; Sorich, Edmond; Fitzgerald, Mark C; Rosenfeld, Jeffrey V; Patel, Sarjubhai A","Prediction of post-concussive syndrome after apparent mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subsequent cognitive recovery remains challenging, with substantial limitations of current methods of cognitive testing. This pilot study aimed to determine if levels of micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) circulating in plasma are altered following TBI, and if changes to levels of such biomarkers over time could assist in determination of prognosis after TBI. Patients were enrolled after TBI on presentation to the Emergency Department and allocated to three groups: A - TBI (physical trauma to the head), witnessed loss of consciousness, amnesia, GCS=15, a normal CT Brain and a recorded first pass after post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) scale; B TBI, witnessed LOC, amnesia, GCS=15, a normal CT brain and a PTA scale test fail and: C - TBI and initial GCS <13 on arrival to the ED. Venous blood was collected at three time points (arrival, day 5 and day 30). Isolation of cell-free total RNA was then assayed using a custom miRNA PCR array. Two micro-RNAs, mir142-3p and mir423-3p demonstrated potential clinical utility differentiating patients after mild head injury into those at greater risk of developing amnesia and therefore, post-concussive syndromes. In addition, these miRNA demonstrated a decrease in expression over time, possibly indicative of brain healing after the injury. Further evaluation of these identified miRNA markers with larger patient cohorts, correlation with clinical symptoms and analysis over longer time periods are essential next steps in developing objective markers of severity of TBI.

Performance of International Classification of Diseases-based injury severity measures used to predict in-hospital mortality and intensive care admission among traumatic brain-injured patients.,"Gagne, Mathieu; Moore, Lynne; Sirois, Marie-Josee; Simard, Marc; Beaudoin, Claudia; Kuimi, Brice Lionel Batomen","BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the main classification system used for population-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) surveillance activities but does not contain direct information on injury severity. International Classification of Diseases-based injury severity measures can be empirically derived or mapped to the Abbreviated Injury Scale, but no single approach has been formally recommended for TBI., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of different ICD-based injury severity measures for predicting in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in TBI patients., METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study. We identified all patients 16 years or older with a TBI diagnosis who received acute care between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2013, from the Quebec Hospital Discharge Database. The accuracy of five ICD-based injury severity measures for predicting mortality and ICU admission was compared using measures of discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration (calibration plot and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic)., RESULTS: Of 31,087 traumatic brain-injured patients in the study population, 9.0% died in hospital, and 34.4% were admitted to the ICU. Among ICD-based severity measures that were assessed, the multiplied derivative of ICD-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS-Multiplicative) demonstrated the best discriminative ability for predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC, 0.858; 95% confidence interval, 0.852-0.864) and ICU admissions (AUC, 0.813; 95% confidence interval, 0.808-0.818). Calibration assessments showed good agreement between observed and predicted in-hospital mortality for ICISS measures. All severity measures presented high agreement between observed and expected probabilities of ICU admission for all deciles of risk., CONCLUSIONS: The ICD-based injury severity measures can be used to accurately predict in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in TBI patients. The ICISS-Multiplicative generally outperformed other ICD-based injury severity measures and should be preferred to control for differences in baseline characteristics between TBI patients in surveillance activities or injury research when only ICD codes are available., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study, level III.",2017,/,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,82,2,374-382,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0000000000001319,28107311,#6294,Gagne 2017,,
Antithrombotic agents intake prior to injury does not affect outcome after a traumatic brain injury in hospitalized elderly patients.,"Julien, Jessica; Alsideiri, Ghusn; Marcoux, Judith; Hasen, Mohammed; Correa, Jose A; Feyz, Mitra; Maleki, Mohammed; de Guise, Elaine","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of risk factors including International Normalized Ratio (INR) as well as the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) scores on several outcomes, including hospital length of stay (LOS) and The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) following TBI in the elderly population., METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected on patients (n=982) aged 65 and above who were admitted post TBI to the McGill University Health Centre-Montreal General Hospital from 2000 to 2011. Age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), type of trauma (isolated TBI vs polytrauma including TBI), initial CT scan results according to the Marshall Classification and the INR and PTT scores and prescriptions of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents (AP/AC) were collected., RESULTS: Results also indicated that age, ISS and GSC score have an effect on the GOSE score. We also found that taking AC/AP has an effect on GOSE outcome, but that this effects depends on PTT, with lower odds of a worse outcome for those taking AC/AP agents as the PTT value goes up. However, this effect only becomes significant as the PTT value reaches 60 and above., CONCLUSION: Age and injury severity rather than antithrombotic agent intake are associated with adverse acute outcome such as GOSE in hospitalized elderly TBI patients.

Association between sleep disturbances and long-term outcomes in mild traumatic brain injury,Gullapalli R.; Tang S.; Rhodes C.; Jiang L.; Roys S.; Zhuo J. ,"Mild TBI (mTBI) accounts for about 70-90% of all TBI cases. Despite the ""mild"" feature, evidence has suggested that mTBI can lead to longlasting cognitive deficits, persistent symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Sleep disorders are commonly seen after TBI with the prevalence rate of sleep disturbances in people with TBI being much higher than that in the general population. The severity of sleep disturbances is not associated with levels of TBI suggesting that TBI across the entire spectrum regardless of severity are at risk. In fact, insomnia and other sleep disturbances were more frequently reported by mTBI patients than moderate to severe TBI patients. Poor sleep quality can impair the cognitive functions in general population. mTBI patients experiencing sleep problem were shown also to suffer from severe overall postconcussion symptoms no matter at which post-injury stage. The objective of this study is to assess the relationship between sleep problem and other post-concussion symptoms, and to look at the association between early sleep problem and long-term outcomes in mTBI. We assessed post-concussion symptoms, neurocognitive functions, level of disability and global outcomes, and rating of satisfaction of life in 64 patients with mTBI. Our results revealed that the presence of sleep disturbances is often accompanied by increased level of overall postconcussion symptoms at the subacute stage of mTBI. Particularly, sleep disturbances tend to occur simultaneously with poor concentration, memory problems and irritability. In addition, sleep disturbance at subacute stage is also associated with persistent poor concentration and memory problems, as well as worse neurocognitive function, slower overall recovery and lower satisfactory of life at long-term. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance can be a prognostic factor of long-term outcomes after mTBI. Early interventions to improve sleep quality can have potential benefits to facilitate the recovery process from mTBI.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,14,A92-A93,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.29111.abstracts,635560418,#19585,Gullapalli 2021,,maybe
Prognostic significance of preinjury anticoagulation in patients with traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Lim X.T.; Ang E.; Lee Z.X.; Hajibandeh S. ,"BACKGROUND Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of injury-related deaths and neurological disability globally. Considering the widespread anticoagulant use among the aging population, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic significance of preinjury anticoagulation in TBI patients. METHODS This systematic review was conducted according to a predefined protocol (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42020192323). In compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology standards, a structured electronic database search was undertaken to identify all observational studies comparing preinjury anticoagulation with no preinjury anticoagulation in TBI patients. The primary outcome measure was overall mortality. The secondary outcome measures comprised in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, need for neurosurgical procedure, and number of patients discharged home. All outcome data were analyzed using random effects modeling. RESULTS Twelve comparative studies enrolling a total of 4,417 patients were included. Preinjury anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-3.50, p < 0.00001), in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.56-3.93, p = 0.0001), and longer length of intensive care unit stay (mean difference, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.54-1.57; p < 0.0001) compared with no preinjury anticoagulation. No statistical difference was observed in length of hospital stay (mean difference,-2.15; 95% CI,-5.36 to 1.05, p = 0.19), need for neurosurgical procedure (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.70-2.44; p = 0.41), and discharged home (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55-1.04; p = 0.09) between the two groups. CONCLUSION Preinjury anticoagulation is a powerful prognosticator of mortality in TBI patients. This highlights the need for dedicated triage and trauma team activation protocols considering earlier intervention and more aggressive imaging in all anticoagulated patients. Future studies should focus on strategies that can potentially reduce the risk of mortality in this population. The prognostic significance of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin remains unanswered.

A Machine Learning Approach for the Prediction of Traumatic Brain Injury Induced Coagulopathy,Yang F.; Peng C.; Peng L.; Wang J.; Li Y.; Li W. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objective(s): Our study aimed to identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Method(s): ML models were developed and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Result(s): Of 999 patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 (95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of threshold probability values. Conclusion(s): The ML models, as indicated by our study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit (ICU).Copyright Â© 2021 Yang, Peng, Peng, Wang, Li and Li.",2021,/,Frontiers in Medicine,8,"(Yang, Li) Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China(Peng) Department of Health Statistics, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China(Peng, Wang, Li) Department of Neurosurgery, Ta",792689,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.792689,636718283,#19115,Yang 2021,,maybe
Factors associated with the development of coagulopathy after open traumatic brain injury,Chen Y.; Tian J.; Chi B.; Zhang S.; Wei L.; Wang S. ,"Background: The incidence of coagulopathy after open traumatic brain injury (TBI) is high. Coagulopathy can aggravate intracranial hemorrhage and further increase morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of coagulopathy after open TBI and its relationship with the prognosis. Method(s): This study retrospectively evaluated patients with isolated open TBI from December 2018 to December 2020. Coagulopathy was defined as international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.2, activated thromboplastin time (APTT) > 35 s, or platelet count <100,000/microL. We compared the relationship between the clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters of patients with and without coagulopathy, and the outcome at discharge. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with coagulopathy. We then compared the effects of treatment with and without TXA in open TBI patients with coagulopathy. Result(s): A total of 132 patients were included in the study; 46 patients developed coagulopathy. Patients with coagulopathy had significantly lower platelet levels (170.5 x 109 /L vs. 216.5 x 109 /L, p < 0.001), and significantly higher INR (1.14 vs. 1.02, p < 0.001) and APTT (30.5 s vs. 24.5 s, p < 0.001) compared to those with no coagulopathy. A Low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), low platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and hyperglycemia at admission were significantly associated with the occurrence of coagulopathy. Conclusion(s): Coagulopathy often occurs after open TBI. Patients with a low GCS score, high NLR, low PLR, and hyperglycemia at admission are at greater risk of coagulopathy, and therefore of poor prognosis. The efficacy of TXA in open TBI patients with coagulopathy is unclear. In addition, these findings demonstrate that PLR may be a novel indicator for predicting coagulopathy.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

Risk Factors and Prognosis of Early Posttraumatic Seizures in Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,Laing J.; Gabbe B.; Chen Z.; Perucca P.; Kwan P.; O'Brien T.J. ,"Importance: Early posttraumatic seizures (EPS) that may occur following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with poorer outcomes and development of posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Objective(s): To evaluate risk factors for EPS, associated morbidity and mortality, and contribution to PTE. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Data were collected from an Australian registry-based cohort study of adults (age >=18 years) with moderate to severe TBI from January 2005 to December 2019, with 2-year follow-up. The statewide trauma registry, conducted on an opt-out basis in Victoria (population 6.5 million), had 15152 patients with moderate to severe TBI identified via Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) head severity score, with an opt-out rate less than 0.5% (opt-out n = 136). Main Outcomes and Measures: EPS were identified via International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes recorded after the acute admission. Outcome measures also included in-hospital metrics, 2-year outcomes including PTE, and post-discharge mortality. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to build a prediction model for risk factors of EPS. Result(s): Among the 15152 participants (10457 [69%] male; median [IQR] age, 60 [35-79] y), 416 (2.7%) were identified with EPS, including 27 (0.2%) with status epilepticus. Significant risk factors on multivariable analysis for developing EPS were younger age, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, TBI sustained from a low fall, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, higher Injury Severity Score, and greater head injury severity, measured using the AIS and Glasgow Coma Score. After adjustment for confounders, EPS were associated with increased ICU admission and ICU length of stay, ventilation and duration, hospital length of stay, and discharge to inpatient rehabilitation rather than home, but not in-hospital mortality. Outcomes in TBI admission survivors at 24 months, including mortality (relative risk [RR] = 2.14; 95% CI, 1.32-3.46; P =.002), development of PTE (RR = 2.91; 95% CI, 2.22-3.81; P <.001), and use of antiseizure medications (RR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.98-3.02; P <.001), were poorer for cases with EPS after adjustment for confounders. The prediction model for EPS had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66-0.79), sensitivity of 66%, and specificity of 73% in the validation set.

Avoidance and Endurance Coping After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Are Associated With Disability Outcomes,Cassetta B.D.; Cairncross M.; Brasher P.M.A.; Panenka W.J.; Silverberg N.D. ,"Objective: Fear-avoidance and endurance behavior are well-established maladaptive coping styles in several chronic health conditions. There is also emerging evidence that both fear-avoidance and endurance coping are associated with poor outcome from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The current study sought to characterize the early trajectories of avoidance and endurance behavior and confirm their association with disability outcomes. Method(s): Adults with mTBI (N=88) completed measures of avoidance, endurance, and postconcussive symptoms at clinic intake (M = 40.2 days since injury). Avoidance and endurance measures were readministered 1 month later (N = 79), and a measure of perceived functional disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0) was completed 3 months after clinic intake (N=69). Result(s): Avoidance and endurance coping were weakly positively correlated with each other at intake (r=.28) and at 1 month postintake (r=.28). Change scores on these two measures over time were not significantly correlated (r=.04). Avoidance coping tended to decrease over time (95% CI [0.6, 2.5]; p=.002), whereas changes in endurance coping were variable. In generalized linear modeling, higher avoidance and endurance at clinic intake and increasing (or less rapidly decreasing) levels of these coping styles over 1 month was associated with greater perceived disability ratings at 3 months, even after controlling for postconcussion symptom severity at intake. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that avoidance and endurance behavior are distinct coping styles with unique trajectories during the subacute recovery period. The results also support the need for psychologically informed early interventions that target specific profiles of maladaptive coping to mitigate risk for poor outcomes post-mTBI.Copyright Â© 2020 American Psychological Association",2021,/,Rehabilitation Psychology,66,2,160-169,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rep0000372,2010967723,#18808,Cassetta 2021,,maybe
Increases in cerebrospinal fluid caffeine concentration are associated with favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury in humans.,"Sachse, Kathleen T; Jackson, Edwin K; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Gillespie, Delbert G; Puccio, Ava M; Clark, Robert S B; Dixon, C Edward; Kochanek, Patrick M","Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive drug and a weak adenosine receptor antagonist, can be neuroprotective or neurotoxic depending on the experimental model or neurologic disorder. However, its contribution to pathophysiology and outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans is undefined. We assessed serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) by high-pressure liquid chromatography/ultraviolet in 97 ventricular CSF samples from an established bank, from 30 adults with severe TBI. We prospectively selected a threshold caffeine level of > or = 1 micromol/L (194 ng/mL) as clinically significant. Demographics, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, admission blood alcohol level, and 6-month dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score were assessed. Mean time from injury to initial CSF sampling was 10.77+/-3.13 h. On initial sampling, caffeine was detected in 24 of 30 patients, and the threshold was achieved in 9 patients. Favorable GOS was seen more often in patients with CSF caffeine concentration > or = versus  or = versus < the threshold. Increases in CSF concentrations of the caffeine metabolites theobromine and paraxanthine were also associated with favorable outcome (P=0.018 and 0.056, respectively). Caffeine and its metabolites are commonly detected in CSF in patients with severe TBI and in an exploratory assessment are associated with favorable outcome. We speculate that caffeine may be neuroprotective by long-term upregulation of adenosine A1 receptors or acute inhibition of A2a receptors.",2008,/,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,28,2,395-401,,,17684518,#10506,Sachse 2008,,maybe
Diffusion tensor imaging during recovery from severe traumatic brain injury and relation to clinical outcome: a longitudinal study.,"Sidaros, Annette; Engberg, Aase W; Sidaros, Karam; Liptrot, Matthew G; Herning, Margrethe; Petersen, Palle; Paulson, Olaf B; Jernigan, Terry L; Rostrup, Egill","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed as a sensitive biomarker of traumatic white matter injury, which could potentially serve as a tool for prognostic assessment and for studying microstructural changes during recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies on TBI that follow DTI changes over time and correlate findings with long-term clinical outcome. We performed a prospective longitudinal study of 30 adult patients admitted for subacute rehabilitation following severe traumatic brain injury. DTI and conventional MRI were acquired at mean 8 weeks (5-11 weeks), and repeated in 23 of the patients at mean 12 months (9-15 months) post-trauma. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, DTI parameters were compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. At the initial scan, fractional anisotropy was reduced in all the investigated white matter regions in patients compared to controls (P <or= 0.01) due to decreased diffusivity parallel (lambda(parallel)) and increased diffusivity perpendicular (lambda(perpendicular)) to axonal fibre direction. Fractional anisotropy in the cerebral peduncle correlated with approximately 1 year Glasgow outcome scale score (r = 0.60, P<0.001) and in this sample predicted dichotomized outcome with 76% accuracy when taken alone, and with 100% accuracy in combination with clinical evaluation by functional independence measure at the time of the first scan. At follow-up DTI, fractional anisotropy in patients had increased in the internal capsule and in centrum semiovale (P <or= 0.01) due to an interval increase of lambda(parallel) with unchanged lambda(perpendicular). In these regions, fractional anisotropy and lambda( parallel) reached normal or supranormal levels, primarily in patients with favourable outcome. In the cerebral peduncle and in corpus callosum, lambda(parallel) and lambda(perpendicular) both increased during the scan interval and, particularly in patients with unfavourable outcome, fractional anisotropy remained depressed. No significant DTI parameter changes over time were found in controls, or in CSF of patients. These findings support that DTI is a clinically relevant biomarker in TBI, which may have prognostic value and also might serve as a tool for revealing changes in the neural tissue during recovery.",2008,/,Brain : a journal of neurology,131,Pt 2,559-72,,,18083753,#10481,Sidaros 2008,,maybe

The Patient Competency Rating Scale was analysed in a logistic regression model with the outcomes Community Integration Questionnaire, Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended and return to work/study., SETTING: The neurosurgical department of a trauma referral centre in a metropolitan hospital., SUBJECTS: A cohort of 70 patients with acute traumatic brain injury, ranging from mild to severe injury., MAIN MEASURES: The Patient Competency Rating Scale, assessing competency in activities, was applied as a predictor. Outcomes describing community participation at 12 months were the Community Integration Questionnaire and return to work/study. Global functioning was evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: Factor analysis of the Patient Competency Rating Scale items yielded three domains: activities demanding cognition, interpersonal/emotional skills, and activities of daily living (ADL) competency. The first two of these domains significantly predicted return to work/study and community integration, whilst global functioning at one year was predicted by interpersonal/emotional competency., CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Competency Rating Scale at three months predicted functioning and participation one year after traumatic brain injury.

Twenty-four per cent of these died within six months. Ninety-three of the 94 (aged 1-88 years) who survived more than three years were included in the follow-up. They were separated into groups based on their level of consciousness at four weeks post injury: oriented (n = 39), confused (n = 22) or in a minimally conscious/vegetative state (MCS/VS) (n = 26) and not possible to assess (n = 6)., OUTCOME MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), participation in work/education (productivity) and posttraumatic epilepsy., RESULTS: GOSE scores were: vegetative state: 3%, severe disability: 28% (22% lower level, 6% upper level), moderate disability: 39% (22% lower level, 17% upper level) and good recovery: 27% (10% lower level, 17% upper level).

Cerebral atrophy after traumatic white matter injury: correlation with acute neuroimaging and outcome.,"Ding, Kan; Marquez de la Plata, Carlos; Wang, Jun Yi; Mumphrey, Marysa; Moore, Carol; Harper, Caryn; Madden, Christopher J; McColl, Roderick; Whittemore, Anthony; Devous, Michael D; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a pathologically heterogeneous disease, including injury to both neuronal cell bodies and axonal processes. Global atrophy of both gray and white matter is common after TBI. This study was designed to determine the relationship between neuroimaging markers of acute diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and cerebral atrophy months later. We performed high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla (T) in 20 patients who suffered non-penetrating TBI, during the acute (within 1 month after the injury) and chronic stage (at least 6 months after the injury). Volume of abnormal fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) signal seen in white matter in both acute and follow-up scans was quantified. White and gray matter volumes were also quantified. Functional outcome was measured using the Functional Status Examination (FSE) at the time of the chronic scan. Change in brain volumes, including whole brain volume (WBV), white matter volume (WMV), and gray matter volume (GMV), correlates significantly with acute DAI volume (r = -0.69, -0.59, -0.58, respectively; p <0.01 for all). Volume of acute FLAIR hyperintensities correlates with volume of decreased FLAIR signal in the follow-up scans (r = -0.86, p < 0.001). FSE performance correlates with acute hyperintensity volume and chronic cerebral atrophy (r = 0.53, p = 0.02; r = -0.45, p = 0.03, respectively). Acute axonal lesions measured by FLAIR imaging are strongly predictive of post-traumatic cerebral atrophy.

In multivariable models, higher age was associated with shorter lengths of stay (P<.001), lower discharge FIM motor and cognitive ratings (P<.001), and greater odds of home health services at discharge (P<.001). Women demonstrated shorter lengths of stay (P=.006) and greater odds of being scheduled for home health services at discharge (P<.001) than men.

Brain-behavior relationships in young traumatic brain injury patients: fractional anisotropy measures are highly correlated with dynamic visuomotor tracking performance.,"Caeyenberghs, K; Leemans, A; Geurts, M; Taymans, T; Vander Linden, C; Smits-Engelsman, B C M; Sunaert, S; Swinnen, S P","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients have a high incidence of eye-hand coordination deficits. Diffuse axonal injury is common in TBI and is presumed to contribute to persistent motor problems. Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), this study sought to identify changes in (sensori)motor white matter (WM) pathways/regions in a TBI group during the chronic recovery stage. A secondary objective was to examine the relationship between WM integrity and upper-limb visuomotor tracking performance. A young TBI (n=17) and control (n=14) group performed a dynamic tracking task, characterized by increasing information processing speed and predictive movement control. DTI scans were administered along with standard anatomical scans. The TBI group was found to perform inferior to the control group on the tracking task. Decreased fractional anisotropy was found in the TBI group in dedicated pathways involved in transmission of afferent and efferent information, i.e., corticospinal tract, posterior thalamic radiation, and optic radiation, due to increased diffusivity parallel and perpendicular to axonal fibre direction. This decrease in WM integrity was associated with inferior visuomotor tracking performance. Moreover, discriminant function analysis demonstrated that the model, based on the combined application of DTI and behavioral measures, was the most effective in distinguishing between TBI patients and controls. This study shows that specific eye-hand coordination deficits in a young TBI group are related to microstructural abnormalities in task-specific cerebral WM structures.

The patients with TBI were further subdivided into 2 groups, that is, mild and more severe TBI groups, based on clinical (mild or moderate TBI), CT (diffuse brain injury [DBI] I or II), or MR imaging (normal or pathological appearance) classification. Fractional anisotropies (FAs) were compared between patients and controls using the region of interest method. Regions of interest were located in 8 different areas including the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiata (CR), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), frontal white matter (FWM), and occipital white matter (OWM) of the periventricular white matter. Eleven patients with TBI also underwent neuropsychological testing, which included the Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and P300 testing in the chronic disease stage (median 364 days)., RESULTS: Region of interest analysis demonstrated significantly lower FA values in the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum in more severe TBI groups (moderate TBI on clinical classification, DBI II on CT classification, and pathological appearance on MR imaging classification) than in controls. A significant difference was also observed in the FA of the splenium between controls and the mild TBI group of the clinical classification. No significant difference was observed in the FA of the CR, ALIC, PLIC, FWM, and OWM between controls and any of the TBI groups of clinical or imaging classifications. No significant difference was observed in the FA of any regions between mild and more severe TBI groups of the clinical or imaging classifications. Multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant positive linear relationship between FA in the splenium and total IQ (r = 0.79, p = 0.004). A significant negative linear relationship between FA in the FWM and P300 latency was also observed (r = 0.62, p = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Fractional anisotropy reductions in the splenium and FWM in the acute stage of mild to moderate TBI may be a useful prognostic factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction.",2011,/,Journal of neurosurgery,115,1,130-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2011.2.JNS101547,21417709,#9295,Matsushita 2011,,maybe
Bimanual coordination and corpus callosum microstructure in young adults with traumatic brain injury: a diffusion tensor imaging study.,"Caeyenberghs, Karen; Leemans, Alexander; Coxon, James; Leunissen, Inge; Drijkoningen, David; Geurts, Monique; Gooijers, Jolien; Michiels, Karla; Sunaert, Stefan; Swinnen, Stephan P","Bimanual actions are ubiquitous in daily life. Many coordinated movements of the upper extremities rely on precise timing, which requires efficient interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum (CC). As the CC in particular is known to be vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI), furthering our understanding of its structure-function association is highly valuable for TBI diagnostics and prognosis. In this study, 21 young adults with TBI and 17 controls performed object manipulation tasks (insertion of pegs with both hands and bilateral daily life activities) and cognitive control tasks (i.e., switching maneuvers during spatially and temporally coupled bimanual circular motions). The structural organization of 7 specific subregions of the CC (prefrontal, premotor/supplementary motor, primary motor, primary sensory, parietal, temporal, and occipital) was subsequently investigated in these subjects with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Findings revealed that bimanual coordination was impaired in TBI patients as shown by elevated movement time values during daily life activities, a decreased number of peg insertions, and slower response times during the switching task. Furthermore, the DTI analysis demonstrated a significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in prefrontal, primary sensory, and parietal regions in TBI patients versus controls. Finally, multiple regression analyses showed evidence of the high specificity of callosal subregions accounting for the variance associated with performance of the different bimanual coordination tasks. Whereas disruption in commissural pathways between occipital areas played a role in performance on the clinical tests of bimanual coordination, deficits in the switching task were related to disrupted interhemispheric communication in prefrontal, sensory, and parietal regions. This study provides evidence that structural alterations of several subregional callosal fibers in adults with TBI are associated with differential behavioral manifestations of bimanual motor functioning.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,6,897-913,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1721,21501046,#9258,Caeyenberghs 2011,,maybe
Religion and spirituality in rehabilitation outcomes among individuals with traumatic brain injury.,"Waldron-Perrine, Brigid; Rapport, Lisa J; Hanks, Robin A; Lumley, Mark; Meachen, Sarah-Jane; Hubbarth, Paul","OBJECTIVE: The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury affect millions of Americans, many of whom report using religion and spirituality to cope. Little research, however, has investigated how various elements of the religious and spiritual belief systems affect rehabilitation outcomes. The present study sought to assess the use of specifically defined elements of religion and spirituality as psychosocial resources in a sample of traumatically brain injured adults., PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 88 adults with brain injury from 1 to 20 years post injury and their knowledgeable significant others (SOs). The majority of the participants with brain injury were male (76%), African American (75%) and Christian (76%)., MEASURES: Participants subjectively reported on their religious/spiritual beliefs and psychosocial resources as well as their current physical and psychological status. Significant others reported objective rehabilitation outcomes., ANALYSES: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to determine the proportion of variance in outcomes accounted for by demographic, injury related, psychosocial and religious/spiritual variables., RESULTS: The results indicate that religious well-being (a sense of connection to a higher power) was a unique predictor for life satisfaction, distress and functional ability whereas public religious practice and existential well-being were not., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this project indicate that specific facets of religious and spiritual belief systems do play direct and unique roles in predicting rehabilitation outcomes whereas religious activity does not.

The association between apolipoprotein E and traumatic brain injury severity and functional outcome in a rehabilitation sample.,"Ponsford, Jennie; McLaren, Anna; Schonberger, Michael; Burke, Richard; Rudzki, Dion; Olver, John; Ponsford, Michael","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in significant disability, but outcome is variable. The impact of known predictors accounts for a limited proportion of the variance in outcomes. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype has been investigated as an additional source of variability in injury severity and outcome, with mixed findings reflecting variable methodology and generally limited sample sizes. This study aimed to examine whether possession of the ApoE e4 allele was associated with greater acute injury severity and poorer long-term outcome in patients referred for rehabilitation following TBI. ApoE genotype was determined for 648 patients with TBI, who were prospectively followed up a mean of 1.9 years post-injury. Hypotheses that e4 carriers would have lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and longer post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration were not supported. Prediction of worse Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) scores for e4 carriers was supported with greater susceptibility seen in females. These results indicate the ApoE e4 allele may be associated with poorer long-term outcome, but not acute injury severity. Possible mechanisms include differential effects of the e4 allele on inflammatory and cellular repair processes, and/or amyloid deposition.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,9,1683-92,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1623,21651315,#9204,Ponsford 2011,,maybe
Suicidal ideation following traumatic brain injury: prevalence rates and correlates in adults living in the community.,"Tsaousides, Theodore; Cantor, Joshua B; Gordon, Wayne A","OBJECTIVE: To explore the rates of suicidal ideation (SI) in a sample of community-dwelling adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess the relationship between SI and demographic and injury characteristics, pre- and postinjury psychiatric history, and psychosocial functioning., PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from a cohort study focused on health, psychosocial functioning, and community integration post-TBI (N = 356). Participants were individuals with mild to severe TBI living in the community., MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to assess SI. Psychiatric functioning was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) Axis I disorders (SCID-I), and psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Life-3, the Flanagan Scale of Unmet Needs, and the Bigelow Quality of Life Questionnaire., RESULTS: There were no differences in SI endorsement based on gender, age, race, income, education, injury severity, or length of time since injury. Those who met current criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder reported SI more frequently. Those with SI reported significantly lower psychosocial functioning., CONCLUSION: Individuals with TBI from all demographic groups and with injuries of varying severity are at risk for SI and thus for emotional distress and suicidal behavior.

Premorbid statin use is associated with improved survival and functional outcomes in older head-injured individuals.,"Schneider, Eric B; Efron, David T; MacKenzie, Ellen J; Rivara, Frederick P; Nathens, Avery B; Jurkovich, Gregory J","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preinjury statin use is associated with survival and functional recovery in older adult victims of moderate/severe head trauma., METHODS: Using the National Study of Costs and Outcomes of Trauma dataset compiled from 69 US hospitals, the effect of preinjury statin use was assessed for in-hospital mortality and functional outcome in patients aged >=65 with head injury Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS)>=3. Individuals dying within 24 hours of admission or presenting with fixed dilated pupils were excluded. The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, dichotomized at the ability to return to premorbid major activity, was used to measure functional outcome. Multivariate regression modeled statin use and outcomes controlling for demographic, comorbidity, and injury characteristics., RESULTS: Of 523 eligible individuals, 117 (22%) used statins at the time of injury. Statin use was associated with a 76% lower adjusted risk of in-hospital death (relative risk [RR]=0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.69). Of 395 individuals discharged alive, 303 survived 1 year and 264 had complete Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Statin users and nonusers demonstrated similar risk of good recovery at 3 months (RR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.46-1.49). At 12 months postinjury, statin users had 13% higher likelihood of good recovery (RR=1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26).

Risk of death remained elevated above societal norms for at least 8 years after discharge from rehabilitation. Mortality risk was increased by: functional dependence at discharge; age at injury; pre-injury drug and alcohol misuse; pre-injury epilepsy; and discharge to an aged care facility. The risk of death from external causes, and respiratory system and nervous system disorders was six to seven times higher, and the risk of death from disorders of the digestive system, and mental and behavioural disorders was five times higher in adults with severe TBI than in the general population., CONCLUSIONS: People who survive to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation following a severe TBI were found to have a sustained increase in risk of death for eight years post discharge.

Rehabilitation LOS was significantly correlated with acute-care LOS (P=0.001) and Glasgow Coma Scale, but not with patients' age (P=0.250) or sex (P= 0.348). Rehabilitation LOS was significantly correlated with functional and cognitive admission outcome scores but not with gains during rehabilitation. Rehabilitation LOS was significantly less in the group of patients that returned back home respect to others.

We sought to investigate the independent relationship between hyperoxemia and long-term mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium database was screened for mechanically ventilated patients with a moderate-to-severe TBI. Patients were categorized, according to the highest measured alveolar-arterial O2 gradient or the lowest measured PaO2 value during the first 24 hours of ICU admission, to hypoxemia (<10.0 kPa), normoxemia (10.0 to 13.3 kPa) and hyperoxemia (>13.3 kPa). We adjusted for markers of illness severity to evaluate the independent relationship between hyperoxemia and 6-month mortality., RESULTS: A total of 1,116 patients were included in the study, of which 16% (n = 174) were hypoxemic, 51% (n = 567) normoxemic and 33% (n = 375) hyperoxemic.

A retrospective review of swallow dysfunction in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Mandaville, Amy; Ray, Anjea; Robertson, Henry; Foster, Careen; Jesser, Christine","In the acute-care setting, it is difficult for clinicians to determine which patients with severe traumatic brain injury will have long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia (>6 weeks) and which patients will begin oral nutrition quickly. Patients frequently remain in the acute-care setting while physicians determine whether to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. To improve the acute-care clinician's ability to predict long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia and subsequent need for PEG tube placement in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) <= 8), a novel prediction model was created utilizing clinical information and acute-care swallowing evaluation findings. Five years of retrospective data were obtained from trauma patients at a Level 1 trauma hospital. Of the 375 patients who survived their hospitalization with a GCS <= 8, a total of 269 patients received Ranchos Los Amigos (RLA) scores.

Ninety-six of the 219 patients were discharged from the hospital with a feeding tube, and 123 patients were discharged without one. Logistic regression models examined the association between clinical and patient characteristics and whether a patient with severe traumatic brain injury exhibited long-term oropharyngeal dysphagia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age, low RLA score, tracheostomy tube placement, and aphonia observed on the initial swallowing evaluation significantly increased the odds of being discharged from the acute-care hospital with a feeding tube.

Intracranial pressure during the ICU course was 19.8+/-11.2 mm Hg. Favorable outcome was obtained in 148 (34%), and unfavorable, in 211 (48%) patients with a mortality of 28%. ICU length of stay (LOS) was 19.4+/-13.9 days. Joint modeling of ICP and ICU LOS was undertaken, adjusted for the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI admission prognostic indicators. A higher ICP was not significantly associated with longer ICU LOS (P=.4). However, presence of a mass lesion on admission head computed tomography was strongly correlated with a prolonged ICU LOS (P=.0007). Diffuse injuries with basal cistern compression or midline shift were marginally associated with a longer ICU LOS (P=.053)., CONCLUSIONS: ICP, as monitored and managed according to BTF guidelines, is not associated with ICU length of stay. Patients with severe TBI and a mass lesion on admission head computed tomography were found to have prolonged ICU LOS independently of other indicators of injury severity and intracranial pressure course.

The TBI cohort was further divided into PTP and posttraumatic non-parkinsonism (PTN) cohorts and compared against a sex-, age-, comorbidity-, and index-date-matched comparison cohort. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause mortality risk in these cohorts after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities., Results: There were 23,504 and 744 patients enrolled in the PTN cohort and the PTP cohort.

Behavioural problems in the first year after Severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective multicentre study.,"Nygren DeBoussard, Catharina; Lannsjo, Marianne; Stenberg, Maud; Stalnacke, Britt-Marie; Godbolt, Alison K","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of behavioural problems in patients with severe traumatic brain injury during the first year after injury and potential associations with outcome. An additional post hoc objective was to analyse the frequency of behaviours with need for intervention from staff., DESIGN AND SETTING: In a prospective population based cohort study 114 patients with severe traumatic brain injury were assessed at three weeks, three months and one year after injury., MAIN MEASURES: Assessments included clinical examination and standardised instruments. Agitation was assessed with the Agitated Behaviour Scale, the course of recovery by the Rancho Los Amigo Scale and outcome by Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: Agitation were most common at 3 weeks post injury and 28% ( n=68) of the patients showed at least one agitated behaviour requiring intervention from staff. Presence of significant agitation at 3 weeks after injury was not associated with poor outcome. At 3 months agitation was present in 11% ( n=90) and apathy in 26 out of 81 assessed patients. At 3 months agitation and apathy were associated with poor outcome at one year., CONCLUSIONS: Most agitated behaviours in the early phase are transient and are not associated with poor outcome. Agitation and apathy are uncommon at three months but when present are associated with poor outcome at one year after injury. In the early phase after a severe traumatic brain injury agitated behaviour in need of interventions from staff occur in a substantial proportion of patients.",2017,/,Clinical rehabilitation,31,4,555-566,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0269215516652184,27277217,#6435,NygrenDeBoussard 2017,,maybe
Dynamics of clinical recovery during the early phase of rehabilitation in patients with severe traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury.,"Oujamaa, Lydia; Francony, Gilles; Boucheix, Perrine; Schilte, Clotilde; Bouzat, Pierre; Perennou, Dominic; Payen, Jean-Francois","PURPOSE: Our aim was to describe the changes in the functional outcome at the early phase of rehabilitation following severe brain injury and to identify the factors associated with faster recovery., METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 182 patients who were transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to a post-ICU neurorehabilitation unit following traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 82) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (n = 100). Admission, discharge and changes in scores were calculated for the Functional Independent Measurement (FIM) and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM).

The impact of direct oral anticoagulants in traumatic brain injury patients greater than 60-years-old.,"Prexl, Oliver; Bruckbauer, Martin; Voelckel, Wolfgang; Grottke, Oliver; Ponschab, Martin; Maegele, Marc; Schochl, Herbert","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death among trauma patients. Patients under antithrombotic therapy (ATT) carry an increased risk for intracranial haematoma (ICH) formation. There is a paucity of data about the role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) among TBI patients., METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated all TBI patients >=60-years-old who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 2014 until May 2017. Patients were grouped into those receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKA), platelet inhibitors (PI), DOACs and no antithrombotic therapy (no-ATT)., RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-six, predominantly male (52.7%) TBI patients with a median age of 79 years (range: 70-85 years) were enrolled in the study. Glasgow Coma Scale and S-100beta were not different among the groups. Patients on VKA and DOACs had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index compared to the PI group and no-ATT group (p = 0.0021). The VKA group received reversal agents significantly more often than the other groups (p < 0.0001). Haematoma progression in the follow-up cranial computed tomography (CCT) was lowest in the DOAC group. The number of CCT and surgical interventions were low with no differences between the groups. No relevant differences in ICU and hospital length of stay were observed. Mortality in the VKA group was significantly higher compared to DOAC, PI and no-ATT group (p = 0.047)., DISCUSSION: Data from huge registry studies displayed higher efficacy and lower fatal bleeding rates for DOACs compared to VKAs. The current study revealed comparable results. Despite the fact that TBI patients on VKAs received reversal agents more often than patients on DOACs (84.4% vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001), mortality rate was significantly higher in the VKA group (p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: In patients >=60 years suffering from TBI, anticoagulation with DOACs appears to be safer than with VKA. Anti-thrombotic therapy with VKA resulted in a worse outcome compared to DOACs and PI.

Eligible participants 18-65 years were contacted 9-104 months post trauma and asked olfactory-related questions. Those reporting possible posttraumatic change of olfaction were invited to further examination using the Sniffin' Sticks panel., RESULTS: Of 211 eligible participants, 182 (86.3%) took part in telephone interviews and 25(13.7%) were diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction. 60% of these, or 8.2% of all participants, had anosmia.

Disability Rating Scale in the First Few Weeks After a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury as a Predictor of 6-Month Functional Outcome.,"Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Aisiku, Imoigele P; Hannay, H Julia; Brito, Frances A; Robertson, Claudia S","BACKGROUND: An early acute marker of long-term neurological outcome would be useful to help guide clinical decision making and therapeutic effectiveness after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We investigated the utility of the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) as early as 1 wk after TBI as a predictor of favorable 6-mo Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOS-E)., OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictability of a favorable 6-mo GOS-E using the DRS measured during weeks 1 to 4 of injury., METHODS: The study is a sub analysis of patients enrolled in the Epo Severe TBI Trial (n = 200) to train and validate L1-regularized logistic regression models. DRS was collected at weeks 1 to 4 and GOS-E at 6 mo., RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.82 for the model with baseline demographic and injury severity variables and week 1 DRS and increased to 0.88 when including weekly DRS until week 4., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that week 1 to 4 DRS may be predictors of favorable 6-mo outcome in severe TBI patients and thus useful both for clinical prognostication as well as surrogate endpoints for adaptive clinical trials.

Cognitive Event-Related Potentials during the Sub-Acute Phase of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury and Their Relationship to Outcome.,"Hauger, Solveig L; Olafsen, Kjell; Schnakers, Caroline; Andelic, Nada; Nilsen, Kristian Bernhard; Helseth, Eirik; Funderud, Ingrid; Andersson, Stein; Schanke, Anne-Kristine; Lovstad, Marianne","Predicting outcome in the early phase after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a major clinical challenge, particularly identifying patients with potential for good cognitive outcome. The current single-center prospective study aimed to explore presence and normalization of electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potentials (ERPs) in the early phase followings TBI, and their relationship to functional and cognitive outcome 6 months post-injury. Fourteen adult patients (eight males) with sTBI were recruited from the neurointensive care unit (mean age = 38.2 years [standard deviation (SD) = 14.7]; mean lowest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score within first 24 h = 5.4, SD = 1.87). EEG recordings were conducted biweekly at three time-points applying an ERP paradigm encompassing a passive condition involving hearing their own name randomly interspersed between an unfamiliar name (UN), and an active condition with instruction to count their own name. Functional and cognitive outcome 6 months post-injury was measured with Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and neuropsychological tests of attention and memory. Ten patients demonstrated a significantly enhanced cognitive P3 in the active counting task compared with passive listening across recordings, and six presented with normalization of P3 in the counting task. Moreover, P3 amplitude to the counting task at the third time-point was positively correlated with both functional outcome (GOSE) and cognition (verbal learning, attentional set-shifting, and switching) 6 months post-injury. ERP can index cognitive capacities in the early phase following sTBI, and the cognitive P3 component in an active design is associated with functional and cognitive outcome, demonstrating that the cognitive P3 may yield valuable information of residual cognition and provide supplementary prognostic information.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,22,3124-3133,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5062,28594285,#6129,Hauger 2017,,yes
"Differential effects of the Glasgow Coma Scale Score and its Components: An analysis of 54,069 patients with traumatic brain injury.","Reith, Florence C M; Lingsma, Hester F; Gabbe, Belinda J; Lecky, Fiona E; Roberts, Ian; Maas, Andrew I R","INTRODUCTION: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is widely used in the assessment of clinical severity and prediction of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The sum score is frequently applied, but the differential influence of the components infrequently addressed. We aimed to investigate the contribution of the GCS components to the sum score, floor and ceiling effects of the components, and their prognostic effects., METHODS: Data on adult TBI patients were gathered from three data repositories: TARN (n=50,064), VSTR (n=14,062), and CRASH (n=9,941). Data on initial hospital GCS-assessment and discharge mortality were extracted. A descriptive analysis was performed to identify floor and ceiling effects. The relation between GCS and outcome was studied by comparing case fatality rates (CFR) between different component-profiles adding up to identical sum scores using Chi2-tests, and by quantifying the prognostic value of each component and sum score with Nagelkerke's R2 derived from logistic regression analyses across TBI severities., RESULTS: In the range 3-7, the sum score is primarily determined by the motor component, as the verbal and eye components show floor-effects at sum scores 7 and 8, respectively. In the range 8-12, the effect of the motor component attenuates and the verbal and eye components become more relevant. The motor, eye and verbal scores reach their ceiling-effects at sum 13, 14 and 15, respectively. Significant variations were exposed in CFR between different component-profiles despite identical sum scores, except in sum scores 6 and 7. Regression analysis showed that the motor score had highest R2 values in severe TBI patients, whereas the other components were more relevant at higher sum scores. The prognostic value of the three components combined was consistently higher than that of the sum score alone., CONCLUSION: The GCS-components contribute differentially across the spectrum of consciousness to the sum score, each having floor and ceiling effects. The specific component-profile is related to outcome and the three components combined contain higher prognostic value than the sum score across different TBI severities. We, therefore, recommend a multidimensional use of the three-component GCS both in clinical practice, and in prognostic studies. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Age-related outcome of patients after traumatic brain injury: a single-center observation.,"Erlebach, Rolf; Pagnamenta, Alberto; Klinzing, Stephanie; Stretti, Federica; Cottini, Silvia; Schupbach, Reto; Steiger, Peter; Brandi, Giovanna","BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to analyze clinical features of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), their age-related outcomes and determinants of long-term outcome., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a level I University Swiss trauma center. Consecutive patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted for more than 48 hours to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients' and trauma characteristics, management during ICU stay, prognostic scores and long-term outcomes were analyzed., RESULTS: Hundred-seventy-four patients (72% males, mean age 49 years) were divided in three age groups: young (<=39 years, N.=69, 39.7%), middle aged (40-64 years, N.=55, 31.6%), and elderly (>=65 years, N.=50, 28.7%). In elderly patients, falls (62%) were the most common cause of TBI. Overall ICU mortality was 15% with no difference among age groups. Within six-months after TBI, 80% of elderly patients presented unfavorable outcomes. Age, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents, abnormal pupillary reactivity, a high score in Marshall CT classification, and a higher glucose level were associated with unfavorable outcomes in a univariable logistic regression. In a multivariable logistic regression, age and abnormal pupillary reactivity were identified as independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes, while presence of epidural hematoma and higher hemoglobin levels were predictors for favorable outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients are at higher risk for long-term unfavorable outcomes than younger patients.

Early predictors of outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (UPFRONT): an observational cohort study.,"van der Naalt, Joukje; Timmerman, Marieke E; de Koning, Myrthe E; van der Horn, Harm J; Scheenen, Myrthe E; Jacobs, Bram; Hageman, Gerard; Yilmaz, Tansel; Roks, Gerwin; Spikman, Jacoba M","BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for most cases of TBI, and many patients show incomplete long-term functional recovery. We aimed to create a prognostic model for functional outcome by combining demographics, injury severity, and psychological factors to identify patients at risk for incomplete recovery at 6 months. In particular, we investigated additional indicators of emotional distress and coping style at 2 weeks above early predictors measured at the emergency department., METHODS: The UPFRONT study was an observational cohort study done at the emergency departments of three level-1 trauma centres in the Netherlands, which included patients with mTBI, defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15 and either post-traumatic amnesia lasting less than 24 h or loss of consciousness for less than 30 min. Emergency department predictors were measured either on admission with mTBI-comprising injury severity (GCS score, post-traumatic amnesia, and CT abnormalities), demographics (age, gender, educational level, pre-injury mental health, and previous brain injury), and physical conditions (alcohol use on the day of injury, neck pain, headache, nausea, dizziness)-or at 2 weeks, when we obtained data on mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List), and post-traumatic complaints. The functional outcome was recovery, assessed at 6 months after injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomised recovery into complete (GOSE=8) and incomplete (GOSE<=7) recovery. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the predictive value of patient information collected at the time of admission to an emergency department (eg, demographics, injury severity) alone, and combined with predictors of outcome collected at 2 weeks after injury (eg, emotional distress and coping)., FINDINGS: Between Jan 25, 2013, and Jan 6, 2015, data from 910 patients with mTBI were collected 2 weeks after injury; the final date for 6-month follow-up was July 6, 2015. Of these patients, 764 (84%) had post-traumatic complaints and 414 (45%) showed emotional distress. At 6 months after injury, outcome data were available for 671 patients; complete recovery (GOSE=8) was observed in 373 (56%) patients and incomplete recovery (GOSE <=7) in 298 (44%) patients. Logistic regression analyses identified several predictors for 6-month outcome, including education and age, with a clear surplus value of indicators of emotional distress and coping obtained at 2 weeks (area under the curve [AUC]=0.79, optimism 0.02; Nagelkerke R2=0.32, optimism 0.05) than only emergency department predictors at the time of admission (AUC=0.72, optimism 0.03; Nagelkerke R2=0.19, optimism 0.05)., INTERPRETATION: Psychological factors (ie, emotional distress and maladaptive coping experienced early after injury) in combination with pre-injury mental health problems, education, and age are important predictors for recovery at 6 months following mTBI.

However, periostin concentrations are undetermined in peripheral blood from patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, serum periostin concentrations were measured in 130 controls and 130 severe TBI patients. We investigated its association with trauma severity reflected by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and prognosis (i.e., 30-day mortality and 30-day overall survival)., RESULTS: As compared with the controls, serum periostin concentrations were significantly increased in the patients [(median, 246.5ng/ml; interquartile range, 164.5-328.6ng/ml) vs. (median, 61.8ng/ml; interquartile range, 37.9-77.9ng/ml), P<0.001]. Periostin concentrations independently correlated with GCS scores (t=-6.199, P<0.001). Serum periostin concentrations higher than 308.2ng/ml predicted 30-day mortality with a sensitivity of 72.4% and a specificity of 78.2% [area under curve, 815; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.737-0.878]. Periostin concentrations higher than 246.5ng/ml were independently related to 30-day mortality and 30-day overall survival with odds ratio value of 3.829 (95% CI, 1.104-13.281) and hazard ratio value of 5.667 (95% CI, 1.953-16.443) respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum periostin concentrations clearly reflect trauma severity and mortality following TBI.

Acute PTH (aPTH) is defined by new or worsening of pre-existing headache occurring within 7 days after trauma, whereas chronic PTH (cPTH) is defined as persisting aPTH >3 months after trauma. An additional goal was to study the impact of aPTH and cPTH in terms of return to work (RTW), anxiety and depression., METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted between January 2013 and February 2014 in three trauma centres in the Netherlands. Patients aged 16 years and older with a GCS score of 9-15 on admission to the ED, with loss of consciousness and/or amnesia were prospectively enrolled. Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 2 weeks and 3 months after injury with the Head Injury Symptom Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and RTW scale., RESULTS: In total, 628 patients were enrolled in the study, 469 completed the 2-week questionnaire (75%) at 2 weeks and 409 (65%) at 3 months. At 2 weeks, 238 (51%) had developed aPTH and at 3 months 95 (23%) had developed cPTH. Female gender, younger age, headache immediately at the ED and CT scan abnormalities increased the risk for aPTH. Risk factors for cPTH were female gender and headache at the ED. Patients with cPTH were less likely to have returned to work than those without cPTH (35% vs 14%, P=0.001). Patients with aPTH and cPTH more often report anxiety (20% and 28%, P=0.001) and depression (19% and 28%, P=0.001) after trauma in comparison with the group without PTH (10% anxiety and 8% depression)., CONCLUSIONS: PTH is an important health problem with a significant impact on long-term outcome of TBI patients. Several risk factors were identified, which can aid in early identification of subjects at risk for PTH.

Skeletal Muscle as a Factor Contributing to Better Stratification of Older Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Shibahashi, Keita; Sugiyama, Kazuhiro; Hoda, Hidenori; Hamabe, Yuichi","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older patients is becoming an increasing problem, and methods that help predict outcomes in this population are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate skeletal muscle mass as a predictive marker for TBI outcome in older patients., METHODS: Older patients (age >=60 years) with TBI were included in this study. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months postinjury. Patients were classified according to their GOS score as having a good outcome (GOS 3-5) or a poor outcome (GOS 1 OR 2). Skeletal muscle mass was estimated, and the relationship with outcome was analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to quantify the independent effects of sarcopenia on the risk of poor outcome., RESULTS: Seventy-four patients (median age, 74 years; 53 males) were included. Outcomes at 6 months postinjury were good in 38 patients and poor in 36 patients. The skeletal muscle area was significantly larger in the good outcome group compared with the poor outcome group (57.3 cm2 vs. 47.6 cm2; P < 0.001). The rate of poor outcome was significantly higher in the patients with sarcopenia compared with those without sarcopenia (0.70 vs. 0.24; relative risk, 2.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-5.64). The difference was statistically significant, and the odds ratio was 3.88 (95% CI, 1.14-13.2; P = 0.031)., CONCLUSION: Reduced skeletal muscle mass was associated with poorer outcome after TBI in our cohort of older patients. Our results suggest that identifying patients with low muscularity may contribute to better stratification in this population. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

All clinical variables related to prognosis were registered, as well as the data from the initial computed tomography. The MR imaging protocol consisted of a 3-plane localizer sequence T1-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin-echo, FLAIR and gradient-echo images (GRET2*). TAI lesions were classified according to Gentry and Firsching classifications. We calculated weighted kappa coefficients and the area under the ROC curve for each MR sequence. A multivariable analyses was performed to correlate MR findings in each sequence with the final outcome of the patients., RESULTS: TAI lesions were adequately visualized on T2, FLAIR and GRET2* sequences in more than 80% of the studies. Subcortical TAI lesions were well on FLAIR and GRET2* sequences visualized hemorrhagic TAI lesions. We saw that these MR sequences had a high inter-rater agreement for TAI diagnosis (0.8). T2 sequence presented the highest value on ROC curve in Gentry (0.68, 95%CI: 0.61-0.76, p<0.001, Nagerlkerke-R2 0.26) and Firsching classifications (0.64, 95%CI 0.57-0.72, p<0.001, Nagerlkerke-R2 0.19), followed by FLAIR and GRET2* sequences. Both classifications determined by each of these sequences were associated with poor outcome after performing a multivariable analyses adjusted for prognostic factors (p<0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to perform conventional MR study in subacute phase including T2, FLAIR and GRET2* sequences for visualize TAI lesions. These MR findings added prognostic information in TBI patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Correlation of tenascin-C concentrations in serum with outcome of traumatic brain injury in humans.,"Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Lou, Lin; Yang, Kai-Chuang; Wang, Hai-Bo; Xu, Yan; Lu, Gang; He, Hai-Yan","BACKGROUND: Tenascin-C, a matricellular protein, is involved in brain injury. However, change of tenascin-C concentrations in peripheral blood remains unknown after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Serum tenascin-C concentrations were measured in 100 healthy controls, 108 severe TBI patients, 79 moderate TBI patients and 32 mild TBI patients., RESULTS: Serum tenascin-C concentrations of patients were significantly higher than those of controls. Tenascin-C concentrations negatively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores in all patients (r=-0.658, P<0.001). In severe TBI patients, tenascin-C in serum significantly discriminated patients at risk of 6-month mortality (area under curve, 0.821; 95% confidence interval, 0.735-0.888) and poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) (area under curve, 0.833; 95% confidence interval, 0.749-0.898) and emerged as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 1.114; 95% confidence interval, 1.008-1.233; P=0.005), overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.085; 95% confidence interval, 1.010-1.166; P=0.003) and unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.049; 95% confidence interval, 1.014-1.076; P=0.001). By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, serum tenascin-C concentrations had similar prognostic value compared with GCS scores., CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced serum tenascin-C concentrations are closely related to trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing tenascin-C as a potential prognostic biomarker after TBI.

"Comparing Plasma Phospho Tau, Total Tau, and Phospho Tau-Total Tau Ratio as Acute and Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury Biomarkers.","Rubenstein, Richard; Chang, Binggong; Yue, John K; Chiu, Allen; Winkler, Ethan A; Puccio, Ava M; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Yuh, Esther L; Mukherjee, Pratik; Valadka, Alex B; Gordon, Wayne A; Okonkwo, David O; Davies, Peter; Agarwal, Sanjeev; Lin, Fan; Sarkis, George; Yadikar, Hamad; Yang, Zhihui; Manley, Geoffrey T; Wang, Kevin K W; the TRACK-TBI Investigators; Cooper, Shelly R; Dams-O'Connor, Kristen; Borrasso, Allison J; Inoue, Tomoo; Maas, Andrew I R; Menon, David K; Schnyer, David M; Vassar, Mary J","Importance: Annually in the United States, at least 3.5 million people seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The development of therapies for TBI is limited by the absence of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Microtubule-associated protein tau is an axonal phosphoprotein. To date, the presence of the hypophosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) in plasma from patients with acute TBI and chronic TBI has not been investigated., Objective: To examine the associations between plasma P-tau and total-tau (T-tau) levels and injury presence, severity, type of pathoanatomic lesion (neuroimaging), and patient outcomes in acute and chronic TBI., Design, Setting, and Participants: In the TRACK-TBI Pilot study, plasma was collected at a single time point from 196 patients with acute TBI admitted to 3 level I trauma centers (<24 hours after injury) and 21 patients with TBI admitted to inpatient rehabilitation units (mean [SD], 176.4 [44.5] days after injury). Control samples were purchased from a commercial vendor. The TRACK-TBI Pilot study was conducted from April 1, 2010, to June 30, 2012. Data analysis for the current investigation was performed from August 1, 2015, to March 13, 2017., Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma samples were assayed for P-tau (using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphothreonine-231) and T-tau using ultra-high sensitivity laser-based immunoassay multi-arrayed fiberoptics conjugated with rolling circle amplification., Results: In the 217 patients with TBI, 161 (74.2%) were men; mean (SD) age was 42.5 (18.1) years. The P-tau and T-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio in patients with acute TBI were higher than those in healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the 3 tau indices demonstrated accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) of 1.000, 0.916, and 1.000, respectively, for discriminating mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, 13-15, n = 162) from healthy controls. The P-tau level and P-tau-T-tau ratio were higher in individuals with more severe TBI (GCS, <=12 vs 13-15). The P-tau level and P-tau-T-tau ratio outperformed the T-tau level in distinguishing cranial computed tomography-positive from -negative cases (AUC = 0.921, 0.923, and 0.646, respectively). Acute P-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio weakly distinguished patients with TBI who had good outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended GOS-E, 7-8) (AUC = 0.663 and 0.658, respectively) and identified those with poor outcomes (GOS-E, <=4 vs >4) (AUC = 0.771 and 0.777, respectively). Plasma samples from patients with chronic TBI also showed elevated P-tau levels and a P-tau-T-tau ratio significantly higher than that of healthy controls, with both P-tau indices strongly discriminating patients with chronic TBI from healthy controls (AUC = 1.000 and 0.963, respectively)., Conclusions and Relevance: Plasma P-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratio outperformed T-tau level as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for acute TBI. Compared with T-tau levels alone, P-tau levels and P-tau-T-tau ratios show more robust and sustained elevations among patients with chronic TBI.",2017,/,JAMA neurology,74,9,1063-1072,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0655,28738126,#6074,Rubenstein 2017,,yes
"Evaluation of novel computerized tomography scoring systems in human traumatic brain injury: An observational, multicenter study.","Thelin, Eric Peter; Nelson, David W; Vehvilainen, Juho; Nystrom, Harriet; Kivisaari, Riku; Siironen, Jari; Svensson, Mikael; Skrifvars, Markus B; Bellander, Bo-Michael; Raj, Rahul","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the brain is essential for diagnostic screening of intracranial injuries in need of neurosurgical intervention, but may also provide information concerning patient prognosis and enable baseline risk stratification in clinical trials. Novel CT scoring systems have been developed to improve current prognostic models, including the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores, but so far have not been extensively validated. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores for predicting functional outcome, in comparison with the Rotterdam CT score and Marshall CT classification. The secondary aims were to assess which individual components of the CT scores best predict outcome and what additional prognostic value the CT scoring systems contribute to a clinical prognostic model., METHODS AND FINDINGS: TBI patients requiring neuro-intensive care and not included in the initial creation of the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scoring systems were retrospectively included from prospectively collected data at the Karolinska University Hospital (n = 720 from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014) and Helsinki University Hospital (n = 395 from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014), totaling 1,115 patients. The Marshall CT classification and the Rotterdam, Stockholm, and Helsinki CT scores were assessed using the admission CT scans. Known outcome predictors at admission were acquired (age, pupil responsiveness, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, glucose level, and hemoglobin level) and used in univariate, and multivariable, regression models to predict long-term functional outcome (dichotomizations of the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]). In total, 478 patients (43%) had an unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-3). In the combined cohort, overall prognostic performance was more accurate for the Stockholm CT score (Nagelkerke's pseudo-R2 range 0.24-0.28) and the Helsinki CT score (0.18-0.22) than for the Rotterdam CT score (0.13-0.15) and Marshall CT classification (0.03-0.05). Moreover, the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores added the most independent prognostic value in the presence of other known clinical outcome predictors in TBI (6% and 4%, respectively). The aggregate traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) component of the Stockholm CT score was the strongest predictor of unfavorable outcome. The main limitations were the retrospective nature of the study, missing patient information, and the varying follow-up time between the centers., CONCLUSIONS: The Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores provide more information on the damage sustained, and give a more accurate outcome prediction, than earlier classification systems. The strong independent predictive value of tSAH may reflect an underrated component of TBI pathophysiology. A change to these newer CT scoring systems may be warranted.",2017,/,PLoS medicine,14,8,e1002368,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002368,28771476,#6069,Thelin 2017,,yes
The impact of Glasgow Coma Scale-age prognosis score on geriatric traumatic brain injury outcomes.,"Khan, Muhammad; O'Keeffe, Terence; Jehan, Faisal; Kulvatunyou, Narong; Kattaa, Abdullah; Gries, Lynn; Tang, Andrew; Joseph, Bellal","BACKGROUND: As the population ages, increasing number of geriatric patients sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI). Communication of accurate prognostic information is crucial for making informed decisions on behalf of such patients. Therefore, the aim of our study was to develop a simple and clinically applicable tool that accurately predicts the prognosis in geriatric TBI patients., METHODS: We performed a 1-y (2011) retrospective analysis of isolated geriatric TBI patients (age >=65 y, head abbreviated injury score [AIS] >= 3, and other body AIS < 3) in the National Trauma Data Bank. We calculated a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-age prognosis (GAP) score (age/GCS score) for all patients. Outcome measures were in-hospital adverse outcomes (mortality and Rehab/skilled nursing facility discharge disposition). Regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were performed to determine the discriminatory power of GAP score., RESULTS: A total of 8750 geriatric patients with TBI were included. Mean age was 77.8 +/- 7.1 y, the median (interquartile range) GCS was 15 (13-15), and the median (interquartile range) head AIS was 4 (3-4). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.7%, and 34.2% of the patients were discharged home. As the GAP score increased, the mortality rate increased and discharge to-home decreased. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed excellent discriminatory power for mortality (area under the curve: 0.826). Above a GAP score of 12, the mortality rate was >50% and more than 45% of the patients were discharged to Rehab/skilled nursing facility., CONCLUSIONS: For geriatric patients with TBI, a simple GAP score reliably predicts outcomes. A score above 12 results in a drastic increase in mortality and an adverse discharge disposition. This simple tool may help clinicians provide accurate prognostic information to patients' families.

Models of Mortality and Morbidity in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: An Analysis of a Singapore Neurotrauma Database.,"Han, Julian Xinguang; See, Angela An Qi; Gandhi, Mihir; King, Nicolas Kon Kam","OBJECTIVE: Current prognostic models for traumatic brain injury (TBI) are developed from diverse historical data sets. We aimed to construct a prognostication tool for patients with severe TBI, as this group would benefit most from an accurate model., METHODS: Model development was based on a cohort of 300 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <=8) consecutively admitted to a neurosurgical intensive care unit at the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), Singapore, between February 2006 and December 2009. We analyzed prospectively collected data of admission characteristics using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to predict 14-day and 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome. Comparison with Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) and Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) models was done using Akaike information criterion., RESULTS: Two prediction models, NNI Clinical (age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupillary reactivity) and NNI+ (NNI Clinical model with addition of obliteration of third ventricle or basal cisterns, presence of subdural hemorrhage, hypoxia, and coagulopathy), were derived from this data set. Both models predicted well across 3 outcome measures with area under the curve values of 0.84-0.91, with adequate calibration. Comparison with CRASH and IMPACT models showed better performance by both derived models with lower Akaike information criterion and higher area under the curve values., CONCLUSIONS: Two accurate prognostic models, NNI Clinical and NNI+, were developed from our cohort of patients with severe TBI. Both models are specific to severe TBI and could be better alternatives to current available models. External validation is required to assess performance of models in a different setting.

Serum S100A12 as a prognostic biomarker of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Feng, Ma-Jing; Ning, Wei-Bin; Wang, Wei; Lv, Zhong-Hua; Liu, Xin-Bing; Zhu, Yong; Gao, Wei; Jin, Hong-Ze; Gao, Shu-Shan","BACKGROUND: S100A12 is related to acute brain injury and inflammation. We investigated the clinical prognostic value of serum S100A12 in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI)., METHODS: Serum S100A12, S100B, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were measured in 102 healthy controls and 102 sTBI patients. We recorded 30-day mortality and in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) including acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction. Trauma severity was assessed by admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores., RESULTS: When compared to the controls, serum S100A12, S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly increased in the patients. Serum concentrations of S100A12 significantly correlated with admission Glasgow Coma Scale scores and serum concentrations of S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Patients with any IMAEs or non-survivors within 30days had obviously higher serum concentrations of S100A12, S100B, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha than other remaining ones. Serum S100A2 was independently associated with IMAEs and 30-day mortality and overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that S100A12 concentrations had significant discriminatory ability for patients at risk of any IMAEs and death within 30days., CONCLUSION: S100A12 might be associated with brain inflammation and evaluation of serum concentrations of S100A12 could be helpful in the early prognostic prediction in sTBI patients.

Early versus Late Profiles of Inflammatory Cytokines after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Their Association with Neuropsychological Outcomes.,"Vedantam, Aditya; Brennan, Jeffrey; Levin, Harvey S; McCarthy, James J; Dash, Pramod K; Redell, John B; Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Robertson, Claudia S","Despite pre-clinical evidence for the role of inflammation in traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is limited data on inflammatory biomarkers in mild TBI (mTBI). In this study, we describe the profile of plasma inflammatory cytokines and explore associations between these cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes after mTBI. Patients with mTBI with negative computed tomography and orthopedic injury (OI) controls without mTBI were prospectively recruited from emergency rooms at three trauma centers. Plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured from venous whole-blood samples that were collected at enrollment (within 24 h of injury) and at 6 months after injury. Neuropsychological tests were performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the injury. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify associations between inflammatory cytokines and neuropsychological outcomes. A total of 53 mTBI and 24 OI controls were included in this study. The majority of patients were male (62.3%), and injured in motor vehicle accidents (37.7%). Plasma interleukin (IL)-2 (p = 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.01) within 24 h post-injury were significantly higher for mTBI patients compared with OI controls. Elevated plasma IL-2 at 24 h was associated with more severe 1-week post-concussive symptoms (p = 0.001). At 6 months, elevated plasma IL-10 was associated with greater depression scores (p = 0.004) and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (p = 0.001). Plasma cytokine levels (within 24 h and at 6 months post-injury) were significantly associated with early and late post-concussive symptoms, PTSD, and depression scores after mTBI.

The application of a biomarker like procalcitonin (PCT) in TBI may allow for assessment of severity and thus aid in prognostication and correlation with mortality and outcome., AIMS: The primary objective is to determine the correlation between PCT concentrations with TBI outcomes (mainly in terms of mortality) at intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay., METHODS: In total, 186 TBI patients aged > 18 years with minimum survival for at least 12 h admitted to the ICU at the level 1 trauma center were prospectively included in the study and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. All admitted patients were treated according to the standard institutional protocol. The PCT levels were obtained on admission, on day 2, and 5. Clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were also collected. Primary mortality is defined as death related to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while secondary mortality defined as death related to sepsis or extracranial cause., RESULTS: Median PCT levels at admission, day 2, and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng/ml. In total, primary mortality was observed in 18 (9.7%) patients, while secondary causes were attributable in 20 (12.3%) patients. Regression analysis for primarily CNS cause of mortality showed PCT cutoff level at admission more than 5.5 ng/ml carried sensitivity and specificity of 75%, but for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, PCT cutoff values on day 2 > 1.15 ng/ml were derived significant with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. No significant association of parameters like length of ICU stay, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and primary/secondary mortality with the presence of extracranial injuries in TBI patients as compared with TBI alone was noted., CONCLUSION: This observational study demonstrates the poor correlation between PCT concentrations with outcome at days 1, 2, and 5 post-injury. The predicted relationship between PCT levels and outcome was not confirmed, and that these results do not support the prognostic utility of PCT biomarker in this population for outcome (mortality) assessment in TBI patients with or without extracranial injuries.",2021,/,Neurocritical care,34,1,182-192,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-01009-y,32533544,#4380,Goyal 2021,,yes

The subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) is an estimate of myocardial perfusion. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the SEVR in patients with severe TBI without previous cardiac diseases. Methods: Adult patients treated for severe TBI with a Glasgow coma score <8 were studied. Pressure waveforms were obtained by a high-fidelity tonometer in the radial artery for SEVR calculation at five time points: immediately after admission to the intensive care unit and 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after admission. SEVRs and other clinically important parameters were analyzed in patients who survived and did not survive after 28 days of treatment, as well as in patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC). Results: A total of 64 patients (16 females and 48 males) aged 18-64 years were included. Fifty patients survived and 14 died. DC was performed in 23 patients. SEVRs decreased 24 h after admission in nonsurvivors (p < 0.05) and after 48 h in survivors (p < 0.01) and its values were significantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors at 24, 72, and 96 h from admission (p < 0.05).

Determinants of Outcome in Traumatic Head Injuries: A South East Nigeria Experience.,"Ogolo, Donald Ekomobong; Ibe, Michael O","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to ascertain factors significantly responsible for mortality from traumatic head injuries and prescribe measures necessary to circumvent such outcome., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all traumatic head injuries seen at our facility from October 2013 to September 2015 was done utilizing data from patient's case notes, ward registers, and casualty department. Extracted data were analyzed using descriptive statistics., RESULTS: A total of 221 patient records were analyzed with 161 men and 60 women. It was observed that although the younger age group (19-30 years) was the most frequently affected by traumatic head injuries (36.2%), the elderly (>60 years) were 4.6 times more likely to die from traumatic head injuries than any other age group. Also, those with severe head injuries were 58 times more likely to die than any other category of head injury, even though the commonest category of head injuries seen were mild head injuries (68.7%). Patients with traumatic head injury from road traffic accidents were 5.8 times more likely to die than any other cause. The sex of the patient and the length of hospital stay had no significant influence on mortality from traumatic head injuries., CONCLUSIONS: The postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score, age of the patient, and mechanism of head injuries are important determining factors of outcome in traumatic head injuries, with the Glasgow Coma Scale score being the single most important determining factor.

[Epidemiological aspects and prognostic factors of severe traumatic brain injuries].,"Assamadi, M; Benantar, L; Ait El Qadi, A; Abou El Hassan, T; Aniba, K","OBJECTIVE: To determine the severity factors in severe traumatic brain injuries., METHODS: A prospective descriptive study of severe head injuries admitted to the emergency department at Ibn Tofail Hospital at the University Hospital of Marrakech over a period of six months from May to October 2015. The following data was collected: circumstances, clinical, biology, radiology, treatment and evolution., RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients with severe traumatic brain injury were collected (101 males, 84,9%). The mean age was 37,73+/-15,7 years. Road accidents were the most common cause representing 84%. The median Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 7+/-3. We noted 36 cases (30,3%) of anisocoria, 32 cases (26,9%) of bilateral mydriasis and 72 cases (60,5%) of hypoxia. Cerebral contusions (66,1%) and meningeal hemorrhage (66,6%) were the most frequent lesions on CT. Forty-seven patients (42%) had stage VI Marshall lesions. Twenty-four patients (20.1%) required a neurosurgical intervention, 12 extradural hematoma evacuations and 10 craniocerebral wounds. Mortality was 64.7% (77 deaths), the main cause was neurological (64,9%). In the latter group, we observed more frequently an older age (P=0.00001), a management delay (P=0.011), a low initial GCS (P=0.000001), a bilateral nonreactive mydriasis (P=0.0001), a hypoxia (P=0.0002), a subarachnoid hemorrhage (P=0.008), a high Marshall score (P=0.017) and an anemia (P=0.046)., CONCLUSION: Head trauma is a public health problem. The victims are young, and the sequelae are frequently disabling. Several parameters are associated with a poorer prognosis including age, neurological state and the initial delay in management.

Rotterdam and Marshall Scores for Prediction of in-hospital Mortality in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: An observational study.,"Asim, Mohammad; El-Menyar, Ayman; Parchani, Ashok; Nabir, Syed; Ahmed, Mohamed Nadeem; Ahmed, Zahoor; Ramzee, Ahmed Faidh; Al-Thani, Abdulaziz; Al-Abdulmalek, Abdulrahman; Al-Thani, Hassan","Background: We aimed to assess the prognostic value of Rotterdam and Marshall scoring systems to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for patients with TBI who underwent head computerized tomography (CT) scan at a Level I trauma center between 2011 and 2018. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the cutoff values for predicting in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1035 patients with TBI were included with a mean age of 30 years. The mean Rotterdam and Marshall scores were higher among non-survivors (p = .001). Patients with higher Rotterdam (>3) or Marshall (>2) CT scores were older, had higher injury severity scores and in-hospital mortality and had lower GCS and blood ethanol levels than those with lower scores. The cutoff point of Rotterdam score was 3.5 (sensitivity, 61.2%; specificity, 85.6%) and Marshall score was 2.5 (74.3% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio 8.4; 95% confidence interval 4.95-14.17 and odds ratio 4.4; 95% confidence interval 2.36-9.39, respectively).

Our aim was to look for a possible shift in TBI epidemiology described in other European countries, to look for possible changes in TBI management and to identify predictors of 1-year outcome especially in patients with mild TBI., DESIGN: Observational cohort study., SETTING: All patients suffering from a TBI of any degree between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015, and who arrived in one of the seven participating BG hospitals within 24 hours after trauma, were included., PARTICIPANTS: In total, 3514 patients were included., OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial care, acute hospital care and rehabilitation were documented using standardised documentation forms. A standardised telephone interview was conducted 3 and 12 months after TBI in order to obtain information on outcome., RESULTS: Peaks were identified in males in the early 20s and mid-50s, and in both sexes in the late 70s, with 25% of all patients aged 75 or older. A fall was the most frequent cause of TBI, followed by traffic accidents (especially bicyclists). The number of head CT scans increased, and the number of conventional X-rays of the skull decreased compared with 2000/2001. Besides, more patients were offered rehabilitation than before. Though most TBI were classified as mild, one-third of the patients participating in the telephone interview after 12 months still reported troubles attributed to TBI. Negative predictors in mild TBI were female gender, intracranial bleeding and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13/14., CONCLUSION: The observed epidemiologic shift in TBI (ie, elderly patients, more falls, more bicyclists) calls for targeted preventive measures. The heterogeneity behind the diagnosis 'mild TBI' emphasises the need for defining subgroups not only based on GCS. Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Selection of CT variables and prognostic models for outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Khaki, Djino; Hietanen, Virpi; Corell, Alba; Herges, Helena Odenstedt; Ljungqvist, Johan","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. Early outcome prediction in patients with TBI require reliable data input and stable prognostic models. The aim of this investigation was to analyze different CT classification systems and prognostic calculators in a representative population of TBI-patients, with known outcomes, in a neurointensive care unit (NICU), to identify the most suitable CT scoring system for continued research., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 158 consecutive patients with TBI admitted to the NICU at a level 1 trauma center in Sweden from 2012 to 2016. Baseline data on admission was recorded, CT scans were reviewed, and patient outcome one year after trauma was assessed according to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The Marshall classification, Rotterdam scoring system, Helsinki CT score and Stockholm CT score were tested, in addition to the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic calculators. The results were then compared with the actual outcomes., RESULTS: Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 3-8 in 38%, 9-13 in 27.2%, and 14-15 in 34.8% of the patients. GOS after one year showed good recovery in 15.8%, moderate disability in 27.2%, severe disability in 24.7%, vegetative state in 1.3% and death in 29.7%. When adding the variables from the IMPACT base model to the CT scoring systems, the Stockholm CT score yielded the strongest relationship to actual outcome. The results from the prognostic calculators IMPACT and CRASH were divided into two subgroups of mortality (percentages); <=50% (favorable outcome) and > 50% (unfavorable outcome). This yielded favorable IMPACT and CRASH scores in 54.4 and 38.0% respectively., CONCLUSION: The Stockholm CT score and the Helsinki score yielded the closest relationship between the models and the actual outcomes in this consecutive patient series, representative of a NICU TBI-population. Furthermore, the Stockholm CT score yielded the strongest overall relationship when adding variables from the IMPACT base model and would be our method of choice for continued research when using any of the current available CT score models.

We aimed to quantify the variability in fluid management policies in patients with traumatic brain injury and to study the effect of this variability on patients' outcomes., METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, comparative effectiveness study of two observational cohorts: CENTER-TBI in Europe and OzENTER-TBI in Australia. Patients from 55 hospitals in 18 countries, aged 16 years or older with traumatic brain injury requiring a head CT, and admitted to the ICU were included in this analysis. We extracted data on demographics, injury, and clinical and treatment characteristics, and calculated the mean daily fluid balance (difference between fluid input and loss) and mean daily fluid input during ICU stay per patient. We analysed the association of fluid balance and input with ICU mortality and functional outcome at 6 months, measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Patient-level analyses relied on adjustment for key characteristics per patient, whereas centre-level analyses used the centre as the instrumental variable., FINDINGS: 2125 patients enrolled in CENTER-TBI and OzENTER-TBI between Dec 19, 2014, and Dec 17, 2017, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. The median age was 50 years (IQR 31 to 66) and 1566 (74%) of patients were male. The median of the mean daily fluid input ranged from 1.48 L (IQR 1.12 to 2.09) to 4.23 L (3.78 to 4.94) across centres. The median of the mean daily fluid balance ranged from -0.85 L (IQR -1.51 to -0.49) to 1.13 L (0.99 to 1.37) across centres. In patient-level analyses, a mean positive daily fluid balance was associated with higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.10 [95% CI 1.07 to 1.12] per 0.1 L increase) and worse functional outcome (1.04 [1.02 to 1.05] per 0.1 L increase); higher mean daily fluid input was also associated with higher ICU mortality (1.05 [1.03 to 1.06] per 0.1 L increase) and worse functional outcome (1.04 [1.03 to 1.04] per 1-point decrease of the GOSE per 0.1 L increase). Centre-level analyses showed similar associations of higher fluid balance with ICU mortality (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.29]) and worse functional outcome (1.07 [1.02 to 1.13]), but higher fluid input was not associated with ICU mortality (OR 0.95 [0.90 to 1.00]) or worse functional outcome (1.01 [0.98 to 1.03])., INTERPRETATION: In critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, there is significant variability in fluid management, with more positive fluid balances being associated with worse outcomes. These results, when added to previous evidence, suggest that aiming for neutral fluid balances, indicating a state of normovolaemia, contributes to improved outcome., FUNDING: European Commission 7th Framework program and the Australian Health and Medical Research Council.

"Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department: Epidemiology, Outcomes and Risk Factors Predicting the Prognosis.","Heydari, Farhad; Golban, Mohammad; Majidinejad, Saeed","Introduction: The continuing-to-grow number of older adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting to emergency departments (EDs) and hospitals necessitates the investigation of TBI in these patients., Objective: The present study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology of TBI and the factors affecting intracranial lesions and patient outcomes in older adults., Method: The present retrospective cross-sectional study was performed between March 2016 and March 2018. The study population comprised all TBI patients with a minimum age of 60 years presenting to the ED. The eligible candidates consisted of patients presenting to the ED within 24 hours of the occurrence of traumas and requiring head CT scan as part of their examination. The patients' baseline information was also recorded., Results: A total of 306 older adult patients with a mean age of 70.61+/-8.63 years, of whom 67.6% were male, underwent CT scan for TBI during the study period. Falls were the major cause of head injuries, and intracranial lesions were observed in 22.9% (n=70) of the patients. Subdural hematoma (SDH) was observed as the most prevalent injury in 27.6% of the patients, 22.9% (n=16) were transferred to the operating room, and 7.5% (n=23) died. Moreover, the severity of trauma was significantly different between the two genders (P=0.029). Midline shift, SDH, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and moderate-to-severe head injuries were also significantly associated with poor outcomes (P<0.05)., Conclusion: Death from TBIs was more likely in the patients with SDH, SAH and midline shift or in those with an initial Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of below 13. These predictions are clinically relevant, and can help improve the management of older adults with TBI.

Outcomes and Measures: As an outcome indicator, each participant's employment status was rated on a 3-point scale (i.e., 3 = regular employment, 2 = welfare employment [employed as a person with disabilities or undergoing vocational training in the Japanese welfare employment system, for which a worker is paid under either system], 1 = unemployment). Psychiatric, neuropsychological, and physical assessments were measured as explanatory variables. The impact of various factors on employment status was investigated using linear discriminant regression analysis., RESULTS: The level of apathy, disinhibition, and incidence of psychiatric conditions after TBI, as well as age and years postinjury, were related to employment status. Conclusion and Relevance: Although this is a cross-sectional study, interventions for apathy and disinhibition, as well as management of psychiatric conditions, are recommended to help improve employment status among people with TBI.

This pilot study focused on TBI patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and aimed at identifying patterns of circulating biomarkers associated with the disability level at 6 months from injury, measured by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E). The concentration of 107 biomarkers, including proteins related to inflammation, innate immunity, TBI, and central nervous system, were quantified in blood samples collected on ICU admission from 80 patients. Patients were randomly selected among those prospectively enrolled in the Collaborative Research on Acute Traumatic Brain Injury in Intensive Care Medicine in Europe (CREACTIVE) observational study. Six biomarkers were selected to be associated with indicators of primary or secondary brain injury: three glial proteins (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S100 calcium-binding protein B) and three cytokines (stem cell factor, fibroblast growth factor [FGF] 23 and FGF19). The subjects were grouped into three clusters according to the expression of these proteins. The distribution of the 6-month GOS-E was significantly different across clusters (p < 0.001). In two clusters, the number of 6-month deaths or vegetative states was significantly lower than expected, as calculated according to a customization of the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) scores (observed/expected [O/E] events = 0.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00-0.90 and 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.94). In one cluster, less-than-expected unfavorable outcomes (O/E = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.05-0.95) and more-than-expected good recoveries (O/E = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.06) were observed.

Development and validation of a prehospital-stage prediction tool for traumatic brain injury: a multicentre retrospective cohort study in Korea.,"Choi, Yeongho; Park, Jeong Ho; Hong, Ki Jeong; Ro, Young Sun; Song, Kyoung Jun; Shin, Sang Do","OBJECTIVES: Predicting diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the prehospital stage is challenging; however, using comprehensive prehospital information and machine learning may improve the performance of the predictive model. We developed and tested predictive models for TBI that use machine learning algorithms using information that can be obtained in the prehospital stage., DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted at three tertiary academic emergency departments (EDs) located in an urban area of South Korea. The data from adult patients with severe trauma who were assessed by emergency medical service providers and transported to three participating hospitals between 2014 to 2018 were analysed., RESULTS: We developed and tested five machine learning algorithms-logistic regression analyses, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, random forest and elastic net (EN)-to predict TBI, TBI with intracranial haemorrhage or injury (TBI-I), TBI with ED or admission result of admission or transferred (TBI with non-discharge (TBI-ND)) and TBI with ED or admission result of death (TBI-D). A total of 1169 patients were included in the final analysis, and the proportions of TBI, TBI-I, TBI-ND and TBI-D were 24.0%, 21.5%, 21.3% and 3.7%, respectively. The EN model yielded an area under receiver-operator curve of 0.799 for TBI, 0.844 for TBI-I, 0.811 for TBI-ND and 0.871 for TBI-D. The EN model also yielded the highest specificity and significant reclassification improvement. Variables related to loss of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale and light reflex were the three most important variables to predict all outcomes., CONCLUSION: Our results inform the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.

Longitudinal Course of Traumatic Brain Injury Biomarkers for the Prediction of Clinical Outcomes: A Review.,"Peters, Austin J; Schnell, Eric; Saugstad, Julie A; Treggiari, Miriam M","Protein biomarkers are often measured at hospital presentation to diagnose traumatic brain injury (TBI) and predict patient outcomes. However, a biomarker measurement at this single time point is no more accurate at predicting patient outcomes than less invasive and more cost-effective methods. Here, we review evidence that TBI biomarkers provide greater prognostic value when measured repeatedly over time, such that a trajectory of biomarker concentrations can be evaluated. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central Register were searched to identify studies from the last decade in which established TBI biomarkers had been measured at more than one time point following acute TBI, and which related their findings to patient outcomes. Twenty-two studies were identified, 18 of which focused on adults and 4 of which focused on children. Three general biomarker trajectories were identified: persistently high, persistently low, and reversal of decreasing concentrations. Downtrend reversal was highly specific to predicting poor patient outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that biomarker trajectories can be affected by therapeutic interventions. Additional studies demonstrated that biomarkers measured at a later time point offered superior prognostic value than a single measurement obtained at initial hospital presentation. Among other details, longitudinal biomarker trajectory assessments may identify ongoing injury and predict patient deterioration before clinical symptoms develop and thus help guide therapeutic interventions.",2021,/,Journal of neurotrauma,38,18,2490-2501,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7448,33899510,#4063,Peters 2021,,yes

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a widely used biomarker of inflammation with potential as a prognostic biomarker after TBI. The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study prospectively enrolled TBI patients within 24 h of injury, as well as orthopedic injury and uninjured controls; biospecimens were collected at enrollment. A subset of hospitalized participants had blood collected on day 3, day 5, and 2 weeks. High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured.

Transcranial Doppler Based Cerebrovascular Reactivity Indices in Adult Traumatic Brain Injury: A Scoping Review of Associations With Patient Oriented Outcomes.,"Gomez, Alwyn; Froese, Logan; Sainbhi, Amanjyot Singh; Batson, Carleen; Zeiler, Frederick A","Background: Disruption in cerebrovascular reactivity following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known phenomenon that may hold prognostic value and clinical relevance. Ultimately, improved knowledge of this process and more robust means of continuous assessment may lead to advances in precision medicine following TBI. One such method is transcranial Doppler (TCD), which has been employed to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity following injury utilizing a continuous time-series approach. Objective: The present study undertakes a scoping review of the literature on the association of continuous time-domain TCD based indices of cerebrovascular reactivity, with global functional outcomes, cerebral physiologic correlates, and imaging evidence of lesion change. Design: Multiple databases were searched from inception to November 2020 for articles relevant to the association of continuous time-domain TCD based indices of cerebrovascular reactivity with global functional outcomes, cerebral physiologic correlates, and imaging evidence of lesion change. Results: Thirty-six relevant articles were identified. There was significant evidence supporting an association with continuous time-domain TCD based indices and functional outcomes following TBI. Indices based on mean flow velocity, as measured by TCD, were most numerous while more recent studies point to systolic flow velocity-based indices encoding more prognostic utility. Physiologic parameters such as intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reactivity as well as more established indices of cerebrovascular reactivity have all been associated with these TCD based indices. The literature has been concentrated in a few centres and is further limited by the lack of multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This systematic scoping review of the literature identifies that there is a substantial body of evidence that cerebrovascular reactivity as measured by time-domain TCD based indices have prognostic utility following TBI. Indices based on mean flow velocities have the largest body of literature for their support. However, recent studies indicate that indices based on systolic flow velocities may contain the most prognostic utility and more closely follow more established measures of cerebrovascular reactivity. To a lesser extent, the literature supports some associations between these indices and cerebral physiologic parameters. These indices provide a more complete picture of the patient's physiome following TBI and may ultimately lead to personalized and precise clinical care. Further validation in multi-institution studies is required before these indices can be widely adopted clinically.

The target of this study was to describe a large series of adult patients suffering from mild TBI, treated at University Hospital of Getafe, between 2010 and 2015 (n = 2480). We examined the patients' epidemiological and baseline clinical profile, diagnosis, treatment and ultimate outcomes, to identify major prognostic factors that influence the final result., METHODS: We retrospectively extracted patient data from medical records and performed both bivariate and multivariate statistics., RESULTS: In our sample, mild TBI was more common in men, and the most common causative mechanism was a traffic accident. We proposed a model for classifying patients according to risk, dividing them into low, intermediate and high risk, based upon their baseline clinical picture. This classification scheme correlated well with final outcomes. We investigated indications for skull radiography and computed tomography (CT), as well as for hospital admission for clinical observation., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of a neurological focus on clinical examination, the existence of a fracture on plain radiographs, advanced age and the presence of a coagulation disorder were associated with the increased likelihood of intracranial complications and a poor prognosis.

Exclusion criteria were any other body region abbreviated injury scale score >2 and presentation at enrolling center >24 hours after injury., METHODS: The analysis was restricted to individuals aged >=65 and stratified into 3 age groups: young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and oldest-old (>=85). Demographic, clinical, and injury data were collected. Predictors of mortality, palliative interventions, and discharge to preinjury residence in the moderate/severe TBI group were identified using Classification and Regression Tree and Generalized Linear Mixed Models., RESULTS: Of the 3081 subjects enrolled in the study, 2028 were >=65 years old. Overall, 339 (16.7%) presented with a moderate/severe TBI and experienced a 64% mortality rate. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <9 was the main predictor of mortality, CT worsening (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, P < .04), cerebral edema (OR = 2.4, P < .04), GCS <9, and age >=75 (OR = 2.1, P = .007) were predictors for palliative interventions, and an injury severity score <=24 (OR = 0.087, P = .002) was associated with increased likelihood of discharge to preinjury residence in the moderate/severe TBI group., CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In this prospective study of a large cohort of older adults with isolated TBI, comparisons across the older age groups with moderate/severe TBI revealed that survival and favorable discharge disposition were influenced more by severity of injury rather than age itself. Indicating that chronological age alone maybe insufficient to accurately predict outcomes, and increased representation of older adults in TBI research to develop better diagnostic and prognostic tools is warranted.

Modeling the return to consciousness after severe traumatic brain injury at a large academic level 1 trauma center.,"Winans, Nathan J; Liang, Justine J; Ashcroft, Bradley; Doyle, Stephen; Fry, Adam; Fiore, Susan M; Mofakham, Sima; Mikell, Charles B","OBJECTIVE: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) carries significant morbidity and mortality. It remains difficult to counsel families on functional prognosis and plan research initiatives aimed at treating traumatic coma. In order to better address these problems, the authors set out to develop statistical models using retrospective data to identify admission characteristics that correlate with time until the return of consciousness, defined as the time to follow commands (TFC). These results were then used to create a TFC score, allowing for rapid identification of patients with predicted prolonged TFC., METHODS: Data were reviewed and collected from medical records of sTBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor subscores <= 5 who were admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital from January 2011 to July 2018. Data were used to calculate descriptive statistics and build binary logistic regression models to identify admission characteristics that correlated with in-hospital mortality and in-hospital command-following. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify admission characteristics that correlated with the length of TFC. A TFC score was developed using the significant variables identified in the Cox regression model., RESULTS: There were 402 adult patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study. The average age was 50.5 years, and 122 (30.3%) patients were women. In-hospital mortality was associated with older age, higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher Rotterdam score (head CT grading system), and the presence of bilateral fixed and dilated pupils (p < 0.01). In-hospital command-following was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil (p < 0.05). TFC was anticorrelated with age, ISS, Rotterdam score, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Additionally, patients who sustained injuries from falls from standing height had a shorter average TFC. The 3 significant variables from the Cox regression model that explained the most variance were used to create a 4-point TFC score. The most significant of these characteristics were Rotterdam head CT scores, high impact traumas, and the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil. Importantly, the presence of a single fixed and dilated pupil was correlated with longer TFC but no increase in likelihood of in-hospital mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The creation of the 4-point TFC score will allow clinicians to quickly identify patients with predicted prolonged TFC and estimate the likelihood of command-following at different times after injury.

Validation of the Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score: Observational Case Control Study.,"Bobeff, Ernest Jan; Stawiski, Konrad; Stanislawska, Patrycja Alicja; Posmyk, Bartlomiej Jozef; Wisniewski, Karol; Bryl, Maciej; Piotrowski, Michal Mateusz; Fortuniak, Jan; Jaskolski, Dariusz Jan","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a particular health risk for the elderly. The recently developed elderly TBI (eTBI) score combines the prognostic information of the risk factors characteristic of the geriatric population. We aimed to determine its validity and reliability on an independent sample., METHODS: We present a retrospective analysis of 506 consecutive patients after TBI aged >=65 years. The previously described nomogram and the eTBI score were used. The primary outcome measure was mortality or vegetative state at 30 days after hospital admission., RESULTS: Mortality or vegetative state rate was 21.3%. The nomogram and eTBI Score showed similar predictive performance with accuracy of 83.8% (95% confidence interval 80.2%-87%) and 84.4% (95% confidence interval 80.8%-87.6%), respectively. On the basis of the Youden index and C4.5 algorithm, we divided patients according to the 3-tier pattern into low-, high-, and medium-risk groups. The outcome prediction in the first 2 groups was correct in 93.1% (survival in the low-risk group) and 94.4% (mortality in the high-risk group). Patients included in the medium-risk group usually required surgical treatment (85.3%) and were characterized by increased mortality or vegetative state (55%). Among patients with eTBI >=5 (n = 221), there was no difference in outcome between those treated conservatively and surgically., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study confirming the validity of the eTBI Score and its close association with outcome of geriatric population after TBI. The novel 3-tier risk stratification scheme was applicable to both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Predictors of mortality among head trauma patients reaching ICU,Beniameen M.; Abbas N.; Mashhour K.; ElGohary T. ,"Study Objectives: Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ninety percent occurs in low and middle income countries. We construct a predictive model for mortality in head injury patients on the basis of easily available parameters. Method(s): Prospective randomized study that included 100 head trauma patients admitted to the ICU in a period of 15 months. Demographic data, diabetes, hypertension and cardiac history were recorded. Admission blood samples were obtained for CBC, coagulation profile, kidney and liver functions tests and lactate level and random blood glucose level. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis including the area under the ROC and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent mortality predictors of admission parameters to create a prognostic model. Result(s): A total of 58 patients died (58%) out of 100 patients included in this study. Multivariate analysis revealed that age> 75 years (HR=25.49, 95% CI=2.36 to 275.66); GCS <9 (HR=4.19, 95% CI=1.58to 11.08); serum creatinine higher than 1.5 mg/ml (HR=8.75; 95% CI=3.10 to 24.71); PaCO2 >45mmHg (HR =14.86; 95% CI=4.85 to 45.49) and history of cardiac diseases (HR=0.37 95% CI=0.15 to 0.91) were associated with high mortality rate.

Method(s): From December 2016 until January 2020, 156 patients, 96 males and 60 females with TBI requiring mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours GCS <= 8 were studied. The mean age was 43 years. On admission to the ICU they had body mass index 27 +/- 6 kg/m2 and APACHE II score 20 +/- 2. Out of 156 patients the 54 had co morbid medical illness.

VAP was significantly associated to patients requiring longer mechanical ventilation 18 days +/- 2 and longer sedation 14 days +/- 2. Patients with co morbid medical illness and VAP were associated with a significantly greater degree of non neurological organ system dysfunction, though there was no difference in frequency of VAP development compared to the patients without co morbid medical illness. Although VAP was not associated with increased hospital mortality, patients who developed VAP had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (28 versus 10 days, p < 0.0001) and longer ICU lengths of stay (31 versus 12 days, p < 0.0001.

Relationship between gender and recovery rate from postconcussion syndrome in older adults receiving physical therapy rehabilitation,Deoghare H.; Mouri C.; List K. ,"BACKGROUND Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a growing epidemic in the geriatric population across the world. A minority of patients with mTBI develop persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS) defined by a cluster of cognitive, somatic and emotional symptomslasting for >3 months. Multiple systematic reviews highlight the prognostic significance of age, biological sex and other factors such as preadmission functional ability and comorbidities on development of PCS. However, these variables remain understudied in older adults. Moreover, research is needed to determine how utilization of physical therapy (PT) services may affect recovery. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between gender and recovery rate from PCS in Older Adults receiving PT rehabilitation. METHOD A retrospective chart review of 45 patients (27 females and 18 males) in the age 65 and older referred for to PT rehabilitation at Saint Joseph Hospital, Orange, CA was performed. More data are being compiled from older paper-based medical records and combined analysis will be presented at the conference. All the patients had a history of a traumatic event such as falls or MVA which may have resulted in concussion. At initial evaluation and discharge, recordings were made of outcome measures of self-report [Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)] and gait and balance performance [Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), gait speed, and the Sensory Organization Test (SOT)]. RESULTS Based on interim analysis both males and females in the 65 and older age group improved with dizziness, balance or both in an average of 9.5 visits. Females had a clinically significant improvement in DHI outcome (27+/-3) whereas for males the average improvement in DHI was not clinically significant (10+/-4) (MCID for DHI =18 units). Additionally, both genders showed clinically significant improvement on SOT (MCID for SOT =8 points) and DGI scores (MCID of DGI = 3). CONCLUSIONS. Both females and males improved in the same number of visits. However, females showed clinically significant improvement over males on self reported dizziness as measured by DHI but not on DGI or SOT.",2021,/,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,69,SUPPL 1,S149,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17115,634826654,#19812,Deoghare 2021,,maybe
Risk factors for cerebral infarction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury,Wu Y.-G.; Chao Y.; Gao G.; Bao D.; Dong Y.; Wei X.; Niu C. ,"Purpose: Posttraumatic cerebral infarction (PTCI) is a common and relatively serious complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) without a clear etiology. Evaluating risk factors in advance is particularly important to predict and avoid the occurrence of PTCI. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 297 patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in our hospital from January 2019 to September 2020 and evaluated the effects of various factors such as age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), skull base fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), brain herniation, hypotensive shock, and decompressive craniectomy on the incidence of PTCI. We also performed a multivariate logistics regression analysis on the relevant factors identified and evaluated the diagnostic value of each risk factor in advance by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Result(s): Among the patients, 32 (10.77%) suffered PTCI. The incidence rates of PTCI in those with GCS scores of 3-8 and 9-12 were 15.87% (30/189) and 1.85% (2/108), respectively, while the rates were 18.84% (13/69), 15.03% (29/193), 18.57% (13/70), and 20.59% (14/68) in those with skull base fractures, traumatic SAH, brain herniation, and hypotensive shock, respectively, and 14.38% (23/160) in those who underwent decompressive craniectomy. These differences in PTCI incidence were statistically significant. However, the differences in PTCI incidence caused by patient age and sex were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Low GCS score, skull base fractures, traumatic SAH, brain herniation, hypotensive shock, and decompressive craniectomy are risk factors for the occurrence of PTCI, while age and sex are not significantly correlated with the occurrence of PTCI.Copyright Â© 2021 Wu et al.",2021,/,Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management,17,"(Wu, Chao, Gao, Bao, Dong, Wei, Niu) Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, China(Wu, Niu) Brain Function and Brain Dis",433-440,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S309662,2007462161,#19708,Wu 2021,,maybe
Cognitive Reserve in Individuals Aging with Traumatic Brain Injury: Independent and Interactive Effects on Cognitive Functioning,Venkatesan U.M.; Rabinowitz A.R.; Bernier R.A.; Hillary F.G. ,"Objective: To examine the influence of 2 temporal factors-age and injury chronicity-on the relationship between cognitive reserve (CR) and cognitive functioning in older adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting(s): Outpatient research laboratory. Participant(s): Adults, 50 years or older, with a 1-to 45-year history of moderate or severe TBI (N = 108). Design(s): Cross-sectional observational study. Main Measures: CR was estimated using demographically corrected performance on a word-reading test (an approximation of premorbid IQ). Injury chronicity was operationalized as number of years since the date of injury. Composite cognitive scores were computed from performances on neuropsychological tests of processing speed, executive functioning, and memory. Result(s): CR was positively and significantly related to all cognitive performances independent of age, injury chronicity, and injury severity. Greater injury chronicity significantly attenuated the effect of CR on processing speed such that individuals more distal from their injury date evidenced a weaker positive relationship between CR and performance. Conclusion(s): Temporal factors may modify associations between CR and cognition. Findings suggest that the protective effects of CR are temporally delimited, potentially contending with declines in brain reserve. The prognostic value of traditional outcome determinants should be considered in the context of injury chronicity.Copyright Â© 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Influence of alcohol on early Glasgow Coma Scale in head-injured patients.,"Shahin, Hazem; Gopinath, Shankar P; Robertson, Claudia S","BACKGROUND: To assess the depressant effects of alcohol on the level of consciousness of patients admitted with head injuries, this study examined the changes that occur in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of traumatic brain injury patients over time., METHODS: The records of 269 head trauma patients consecutively admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit were examined retrospectively. Eighty-one patients were excluded because of incomplete data. The remaining 188 patients were further divided into an intoxicated group (blood alcohol concentration [BAC] >= 0.08%, n = 100 [53%]) and a nonintoxicated group (BAC <0.08%, n = 88 [47%]). The GCS in the prehospital setting, in the emergency department, and the highest GCS achieved during the first 24 hours postinjury were compared., RESULTS: The change between emergency department-GCS and the best day 1 GCS in the intoxicated group was greater than the nonintoxicated group and deemed clinically and statistically significant; median change (3 vs. 0) p < 0.001. To assess whether these results were directly related to the BAC%, piecewise regression using a general linear model was used to assess the intercept and slope of alcohol on the changes of GCS with cutting point at BAC% = 0.08. The analysis showed that, in the nonintoxicated range, the effect of alcohol was not significantly related to the changes of GCS. But in the intoxicated range, BAC% was significantly positively related to the changes of GCS., CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the GCS increases significantly over time in alcohol intoxicated patients with traumatic brain injury.",2010,/,The Journal of trauma,69,5,1176-1181,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e3181edbd47,21068620,#9484,Shahin 2010,,yes

This study aims to validate glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B concentrations in blood as outcome predictors of TBI using cutoff levels of 1.5 mug/L for GFAP and 1.13 mug/L for S100B from a previous study., METHODS: In 79 patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] <=12), serum, taken at hospital admission, was analyzed for GFAP and S100B. Data collected included injury mechanism, age, gender, mass lesion on CT, GCS, pupillary reactions, Injury Severity Score (ISS), presence of hypoxia, and hypotension. Outcome was assessed, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (dichotomized in death vs alive and unfavorable vs favorable), 6 months post injury., RESULTS: In patients who died compared to alive patients, median serum levels were increased: GFAP 33.4-fold and S100B 2.1-fold. In unfavorable compared to favorable outcome, GFAP was increased 19.8-fold and S100B 2.1-fold. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that mass lesion, GFAP, absent pupils, age, and ISS, but not GCS, hypotension, or hypoxia, predicted death and unfavorable outcome. Multivariable analysis showed that models containing mass lesion, pupils, GFAP, and S100B were the strongest in predicting death and unfavorable outcome.

Hypothermia and rapid rewarming is associated with worse outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Thompson, Hilaire J; Kirkness, Catherine J; Mitchell, Pamela H","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine (1) the prevalence and degree of hypothermia in patients on emergency department admission and (2) the effect of hypothermia and rate of rewarming on patient outcomes., METHODS: Secondary data analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a level I trauma center following severe traumatic brain injury (n = 147). Patients were grouped according to temperature on admission according to hypothermia status and rate of rewarming (rapid or slow). Regression analyses were performed., FINDINGS: Hypothermic patients were more likely to have lower postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale scores and a higher initial injury severity score. Hypothermia on admission was correlated with longer intensive care unit stays, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale score at discharge, higher mortality rate, and lower Glasgow outcome score-extended scores up to 6 months postinjury (P < .05). When controlling for other factors, rewarming rates more than 0.25degreeC/h were associated with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores at discharge, longer intensive care unit length of stay, and higher mortality rate than patients rewarmed more slowly although these did not reach statistical significance., CONCLUSION: Hypothermia on admission is correlated with worse outcomes in brain-injured patients.

External validation of a prognostic model for early mortality after traumatic brain injury.,"Ronning, Pal A; Pedersen, Tor; Skaga, Nils O; Helseth, Eirik; Langmoen, Iver A; Stavem, Knut","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of lost disability-adjusted life years, and a valid model allowing prediction of outcome would be welcome. For a clinical prediction model to be valid, generalization to other populations must be possible. The aim of this study was to externally validate a model for in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI, which was recently development at the University of Southern California (USC)., METHODS: The validation cohort was derived from a hospital-based, prospectively collected trauma registry in Oslo, Norway. We included patients admitted with a head injury without hypotension, severe thoracic, or abdominal injury (n = 3,136). We calculated the probability of death according to the USC model. The performance of the model was evaluated using measures of calibration and discrimination in the total sample and subgroups according to initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score., RESULTS: The USC model provided excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.93), but unsatisfactory calibration (p < 0.001) for the total sample (GCS 3-15). In the GCS 4-8 subgroup we found good discrimination (AUC = 0.89) but poor calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The findings question the external validity of the USC model, suggesting that it should not be implemented as a tool for short-term mortality prediction in our TBI population.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,70,4,E56-61,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e3181e80f0a,20805767,#9420,Ronning 2011,,yes
Mild hypothermia therapy reduces blood glucose and lactate and improves neurologic outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Zhao, Qing-Jv; Zhang, Xue-Guang; Wang, Le-Xin","PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the association between blood glucose or lactate and the outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to evaluate the effect of mild hypothermia therapy on glucose and lactate levels., METHODS: Eighty-one patients with TBI were randomly divided into normothermia (n = 41) and mild hypothermia (n = 40) group. Body temperature of hypothermia group was maintained at 32.7degreeC for 72 hours. Arterial blood glucose and lactic acid were determined before and after hypothermia therapy. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score was assessed 3 months after the treatment., RESULTS: The mean glucose (7.04 +/- 0.51 vs 9.71 +/- 1.63 mmol/L, P < .05) in the hypothermia group was lower than in the normothermia group after hypothermia therapy. There were more patients with good neurologic function (GOS 4-5) in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (75.0% vs 51.2%, P = .038). Multivariate regression analysis showed that blood glucose greater than 10 mmol/L (adjusted risk ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-13.2; P < .05) was an independent predictor for poor neurologic outcomes in these patients, and hypothermia therapy was an independent predictor for favorable outcomes (risk ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-15.6; P < .05). No significant association between lactate and GOS scores was identified in the multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia after TBI was associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the predictive value of blood lactate level requires further investigation. Hypothermia therapy improves neurologic outcomes in patients with severe TBI, and reduction in blood glucose may be partially responsible for the improved outcomes. Crown Copyright Â© 2011.

Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a humoral component of the innate immune system which has been studied as a marker of inflammatory, infections or cardiovascular pathologies. To investigate the association between serum levels of PTX3 and the hospital mortality of patients with severe TBI., METHODS: The independent association between serum PTX3 levels after severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS <= 8) and hospital mortality was analyzed in a prospective study of 83 consecutive patients by a multiple logistic regression analysis. The leukocyte count in the same sample was analyzed as another marker of inflammatory response., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 35 years and 85% were male. Serum PTX3 levels were determined 18.0 (SD +/- 17.0) h after TBI. Patients who died showed a mean serum PTX3 level of 9.95 mug/ml (SD +/- 6.42) in comparison to 5.46 mug/ml (SD +/- 4.87) of the survivor group (P = 0.007). Elevated serum PTX3 levels remain significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.04) in the subset of patients with isolated TBI (n = 34). There were no differences in the leukocytes count measured in the same blood sample used for PTX3 determination in survivors and non-survivors (P = 0.56). The final multiple logistic regression model including age, pupillary examination, GCS, associated trauma, and PTX3 levels shows that serum levels of PTX3 which were higher than 10 mug/ml were independently associated with the patients mortality (adjusted OR 3.06, CI 95% 1.03-9.15, P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum PTX3 levels after severe TBI are independently associated with higher hospital mortality and may be a useful marker of TBI and its prognosis.",2011,/,Neurocritical care,14,2,194-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-010-9462-y,20972645,#9401,Gullo 2011,,yes

Acute and delayed mild coagulopathy are related to outcome in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury.,"Greuters, Sjoerd; van den Berg, Annelies; Franschman, Gaby; Viersen, Victor A; Beishuizen, Albertus; Peerdeman, Saskia M; Boer, Christa; ALARM-BLEEDING investigators","INTRODUCTION: The relationship between isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) associated coagulopathy and patient prognosis frequently lacks information regarding the time course of coagulation disorders throughout the post-traumatic period. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and time course of post-traumatic coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI and the relationship of these hemostatic disorders with outcome., METHODS: The local Human Subjects Committee approved the study. We retrospectively studied the medical records of computed tomography (CT)-confirmed isolated TBI patients with an extracranial abbreviated injury scale (AIS) <3 who were primarily referred to a Level 1 trauma centre in Amsterdam (n = 107). Hemostatic parameters including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, glucose, pH and lactate levels were recorded throughout a 72-hour period as part of a routine standardized follow-up of TBI. Coagulopathy was defined as a aPPT >40 seconds and/or a PTT in International Normalized Ratio (INR) >1.2 and/or a platelet count <120*109/l., RESULTS: Patients were mostly male, aged 48 +/- 20 years with a median injury severity score of 25 (range 20 to 25). Early coagulopathy as diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) occurred in 24% of all patients. The occurrence of TBI-related coagulopathy increased to 54% in the first 24 hours post-trauma. In addition to an increased age and disturbed pupillary reflex, both coagulopathy upon ED arrival and during the first 24 hours post-trauma provided an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable outcome (odds ratio (OR) 3.75 (95% CI 1.07 to 12.51; P = 0.04) and OR 11.61 (2.79 to 48.34); P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a high prevalence of early and delayed coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI, which is strongly associated with an unfavorable outcome. These data support close monitoring of hemostasis after TBI and indicate that correction of coagulation disturbances might need to be considered.",2011,/,"Critical care (London, England)",15,1,R2,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc9399,21208418,#9376,Greuters 2011,,yes
Predictive ability of preinjury stressful life events and post-traumatic stress symptoms for outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury: analysis in a prospective emergency room sample.,"van Veldhoven, L M; Sander, A M; Struchen, M A; Sherer, M; Clark, A N; Hudnall, Gina Evans; Hannay, H J","BACKGROUND: A subset of persons with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) experience long-term difficulties. Preinjury stress has been hypothesised to play a role in long-term maintenance of symptoms., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive ability of preinjury stressful life events and post-traumatic stress symptoms to health-related quality of life and emotional distress after mTBI., METHODS: Within 2 weeks of injury, 186 participants with mTBI who were admitted to an emergency centre completed an interview and questionnaires regarding preinjury functioning, including the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months after injury and included the depression and anxiety subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the physical and mental component scores of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The incidence and type of stressful life events were reported. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine the predictive utility of Stressful Life Events Questionnaire and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist after controlling for age, injury severity (complicated versus uncomplicated mild) and preinjury depression., RESULTS: Several potentially life-altering stressful events were endorsed by at least 25% of participants as having been experienced prior to injury. The incidence of stressful life events was a significant predictor of all four outcome variables. History of post-traumatic stress symptoms was predictive of scores on the SF-36 mental health component., CONCLUSIONS: A history of stressful events may predispose persons with mTBI to have poor outcomes.

Correlation between coagulopathy and outcome in severe head trauma in neurointensive care and trauma units.,"Salehpour, Firooz; Bazzazi, Amir Mohammad; Porhomayon, Jahan; Nader, Nader D","BACKGROUND: Abnormal blood coagulation after traumatic brain injury is a common finding. Some studies have proposed these changes as useful predictors of outcome in patients with head trauma. This study aimed at evaluating the association of the routine tests of blood coagulation within the first hours after severe head trauma with prognosis of patients with severe head trauma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients with severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], <=8) were admitted at Tabriz University Hospital for 1 year. Patients with major accompanying trauma were excluded. On admission, serum levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as the platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were documented. The relation between these parameters with final outcome and also with GCS at admission, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week after admission and discharge time and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were studied., RESULTS: Thirty three patients were discharged, and 19 died. There were significant negative correlations between PT, PTT, and INR with all GCS and GOS scores. These correlations were significant and positive between the platelet count and all GCS and GOS scores. Median PT, PTT, and INR were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Median serum platelets count was significantly lower in nonsurvivors., CONCLUSION: On-admission PT, PTT, INR and platelet count may be used as predictors of outcome and prognosis of patients with severe head trauma.

In vivo monitoring of neuronal loss in traumatic brain injury: a microdialysis study.,"Petzold, Axel; Tisdall, Martin M; Girbes, Armand R; Martinian, Lillian; Thom, Maria; Kitchen, Neil; Smith, Martin","Traumatic brain injury causes diffuse axonal injury and loss of cortical neurons. These features are well recognized histologically, but their in vivo monitoring remains challenging. In vivo cortical microdialysis samples the extracellular fluid adjacent to neurons and axons. Here, we describe a novel neuronal proteolytic pathway and demonstrate the exclusive neuro-axonal expression of Pavlov's enterokinase. Enterokinase is membrane bound and cleaves the neurofilament heavy chain at positions 476 and 986. Using a 100 kDa microdialysis cut-off membrane the two proteolytic breakdown products, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chains NfH(476-986) and NfH(476-1026), can be quantified with a relative recovery of 20%. In a prospective clinical in vivo study, we included 10 patients with traumatic brain injury with a median Glasgow Coma Score of 9, providing 640 cortical extracellular fluid samples for longitudinal data analysis. Following high-velocity impact traumatic brain injury, microdialysate extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were significantly higher (6.18 +/- 2.94 ng/ml) and detectable for longer (> 4 days) compared with traumatic brain injury secondary to falls (0.84 +/- 1.77 ng/ml, < 2 days). During the initial 16 h following traumatic brain injury, strong correlations were found between extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels and physiological parameters (systemic blood pressure, anaerobic cerebral metabolism, excessive brain tissue oxygenation, elevated brain temperature). Finally, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were of prognostic value, predicting mortality with an odds ratio of 7.68 (confidence interval 2.15-27.46, P = 0.001). In conclusion, this study describes the discovery of Pavlov's enterokinase in the human brain, a novel neuronal proteolytic pathway that gives rise to specific protein biomarkers (NfH(476-986) and Nf(H476-1026)) applicable to in vivo monitoring of diffuse axonal injury and neuronal loss in traumatic brain injury.",2011,/,Brain : a journal of neurology,134,Pt 2,464-83,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq360,21278408,#9353,Petzold 2011,,yes
Death after head injury: the 13 year outcome of a case control study.,"McMillan, T M; Teasdale, G M; Weir, C J; Stewart, E","BACKGROUND: Head injury is common, and the risk of subsequent disability and death is high. Increased risk of death years after injury might be explained by factors associated with, but not a consequence of, the head injury. This unique prospective study investigates mortality over 13 years after injury., METHODS: A cohort of n=767 with head injury was compared with two case control groups, matched for age, gender and deprivation, and in one control group, matched for duration of hospital admission following (non-head) injury., RESULTS: Two-fifths of the head injury cohort had died. The death rate (30.99 per 1000 per year) was much higher than in community controls (13.72 per 1000 per year). More than 1 year after injury, the death rate in younger (15-54 years) adults was much higher than in community controls (17.36 vs. 2.36 per 1000 per year) whereas in older adults the difference was more marginal (61.47 vs. 42.36). Death rate was elevated after mild and after more severe head injury, including in younger adults after mild head injury (14.82 per 1000 per year mild head injury vs. 2.21 community). Female gender and greater deprivation were not associated with increased death rates after head injury. Late after injury, deaths occurred from the same main causes as for the general population., CONCLUSION: Head injury is associated with increased vulnerability to death from a variety of causes for at least 13 years after hospital admission. There is a need to understand how head injury influences mortality, particularly in younger adults and after mild head injury.",2011,/,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",82,8,931-5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2010.222232,21282727,#9352,McMillan 2011,,yes
Computed tomography and outcome in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: hematoma volume and midline shift revisited.,"Jacobs, Bram; Beems, Tjemme; van der Vliet, Ton M; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon R; Borm, George F; Vos, Pieter E","Intracranial lesion volume and midline shift are powerful outcome predictors in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and therefore they are used in TBI and computed tomography (CT) classification schemes, like the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) classification. In this study we aimed to explore the prognostic value of lesion volume and midline shift in moderate and severe TBI as measured from acute cranial CT scans. Also, we wanted to determine interrater reliability for the evaluation of these CT abnormalities. We included all consecutive moderate and severe TBI patients admitted to our hospital who were aged >=16 years, over an 8-year period, as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study. Six months post-trauma we assessed outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). We analyzed 605 patients and found an association of both lesion volume and midline shift with outcome; increases were associated with a higher frequency of patients with an unfavorable outcome or death. A cut-off value, such as that used in the TCDB CT classification (lesion volume 25 mL and midline shift 5 mm), was not found. The average interrater difference in volume measurement was 6.8 mL, and it was 0.2 mm for the determination of degree of shift. Using lesion volume and midline shift as continuous variables in prognostic models might be preferable over the use of threshold values, although an association of these variables with outcome in relation to other CT abnormalities was not tested.

Acute kidney injury in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: implementation of the acute kidney injury network stage system.,"Li, Ning; Zhao, Wei-Guo; Zhang, Wei-Feng","BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the incidence and effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although AKI may affect outcome. Recently, acute kidney injury network (AKIN) classification has been widely accepted as a consensus definition for AKI. The aim of this study is to estimate the frequency and level of severity of AKI in patients with severe TBI by using AKIN criteria and to study whether AKI affects outcome., METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified a total of 136 patients with severe TBI admitted to the neurosurgical center during a 3-year period ending May 2010. Demographic data, severity of TBI, serum creatinine, urine output, outcome at 6 month, and death were collected. Renal function was assessed by using AKIN criteria., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (23%) were classified as having AKI by using AKIN criteria during their hospitalization. Of them, 21 patients (68%) were stratified as stage 1, 7 patients (22%) as stage 2, and 3 patients (10%) as stage 3. Patients who developed AKI were older, had lower Glasgow coma scale at admission, and had higher level of admission serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Patients with AKI had higher mortality and worse outcome when compared with patients with normal renal function. Furthermore, patients with mild renal dysfunction (stage 1 AKI) are also found having increased mortality and worse long-term outcome, compared with patients without renal dysfunction., CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated using the newly defined AKIN criteria for renal dysfunction that AKI is a relatively common feature in patients with severe TBI, and even seemingly insignificant decrease in renal function may be associated with worse outcome.

Patients were divided into groups on the basis of status of CPA (more pressure active vs more pressure passive) and level of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP; low vs high CPP). The proportions of favorable outcome in the groups were assessed. Differences in physiological variables in the different groups were analyzed., RESULTS: Patients with more impaired CPA treated at CPP levels below median had a significantly higher proportion of favorable outcome compared with patients with more impaired CPA treated at CPP levels above median. No significant difference in outcome was seen between patients with more intact CPA when divided by level of CPP. In patients with more impaired CPA, CPP<50 mm Hg and CPP<60 mm Hg were associated with favorable outcome, whereas CPP>70 mm Hg and CPP>80 mm Hg were associated with unfavorable outcome.

Significance of minor traumatic lesions in focal head injuries.,"Yanagawa, Youichi; Sakamoto, Toshihisa",We investigated the significance of minor traumatic lesions associated with focal head injuries. Patients included in the study were admitted between January 2003 and December 2007 and had sustained a head injury with focal injury and undergone MRI examination including T2(*)-weighted imaging. Patients were divided into two groups: (i) a T2(*)-positive group - those who had hypointense lesions at sites other than the original injury site as shown by T2(*)-weighted MRI (n=12); and (ii) a control group without hypointense lesions at sites other than the original injury (n=25). The median Glasgow Outcome Scale score was significantly lower in the T2(*)-positive group (median=4; range=4-5) than in the control group (median=5; range=4-5; p=0.003). We conclude that patients with a focal head injury and minor traumatic lesions are likely to have a poorer prognosis than patients without additional minor traumatic lesions.

To compare S100B and NSE for the prediction of nonsurvival and survival patients we performed receiver operating characteristic curves. At admission, CSF NSE level predicts brain death more accurately than S100B., CONCLUSION: Early elevations (up to 3 days) of S100B and NSE secondary to severe TBI predict deterioration to brain death. However, this feature was more prominently associated with NSE than S100B.

In conventional MRI 7 patients were without visible findings, 15 showed cortical contusions or traumatic axonal injury and 14 healthy subjects served as controls. The ADC values were measured from 46 brain regions away from the visible traumatic changes and compared between the groups. Regional ADC values and the number of abnormal regions were correlated with the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on arrival in hospital and the Glasgow outcome scale (extended version, GOS-E) at 1 year after injury., RESULTS: The ADC values of TBI patients with and without visible lesions did not show any differences but both groups differed significantly from the controls in several cortical and deep brain regions. Increased ADC values were common in TBI groups but decreased ADC values were relatively uncommon. The regional ADC values and the number of abnormal regions did not correlate with either GCS or GOS-E scores., CONCLUSIONS: Increased diffusion in normal appearing brain tissue is a common finding 1 week after TBI in patients with and without visible lesions in conventional MRI.

Prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in moderate and severe head injury: a prospective study of early MRI findings and one-year outcome.,"Skandsen, Toril; Kvistad, Kjell Arne; Solheim, Ole; Lydersen, Stian; Strand, Ingrid Haavde; Vik, Anne","The clinical benefit of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in severe and moderate head injury is unclear. We sought to explore the prognostic value of the depth of lesions depicted with early MRI, and also to describe the prevalence and impact of traumatic brainstem lesions. In a cohort of 159 consecutive patients with moderate to severe head injury (age 5-65 years and surviving the acute phase) admitted to a regional level 1 trauma center, 106 (67%) were examined with MRI within 4 weeks post-injury. Depth of lesions in MRI was categorized as: hemisphere level, central level, and brainstem injury (BSI). The outcome measure was Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) 12 months post-injury. Forty-six percent of patients with severe injuries and 14% of patients with moderate injuries had BSI. In severe head injury, central or brainstem lesions in MRI, together with higher Rotterdam CT score, pupillary dilation, and secondary adverse events were significantly associated with a worse outcome in age-adjusted analyses. Bilateral BSI was strongly associated with a poor outcome in severe injury, with positive and negative predictive values of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. In moderate injury, only age was significantly associated with outcome in multivariable analyses. Limitations of the current study include lack of blinded outcome evaluations and insufficient statistical power to assess the added prognostic value of MRI when combined with clinical information. We conclude that in patients with severe head injury surviving the acute phase, depth of lesion on the MRI was associated with outcome, and in particular, bilateral brainstem injury was strongly associated with poor outcomes. In moderate head injury, surprisingly, there was no association between MRI findings and outcome when using the GOSE score as outcome measure.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,5,691-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1590,21401308,#9300,Skandsen 2011,,yes
Risk factors for reduced survival after traumatic brain injury: a 30-year follow-up study.,"Himanen, Leena; Portin, Raija; Hamalainen, Paivi; Hurme, Saija; Hiekkanen, Heli; Tenovuo, Olli","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for reduced survival in subjects with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A retrospective follow-up of three decades included 192 subjects with TBI. Cognitive testing was carried out on average 2 years after the injury (at mean age of 39.0 years), during the years 1966-1972. Cox's regression and logistic regression analyses were used and the survival of the subjects was compared with the general population using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR)., RESULTS: Reduced survival was significantly associated with age at injury (p < 0.001) and vocational outcome (p = 0.003). Vocational outcome in turn was associated with age (p = 0.010), TBI severity (p < 0.001), cognitive impairment (p = 0.010), later TBIs (p = 0.007) and alcohol abuse (p = 0.015). Mortality in the younger patient group (age at death <40 years) was higher than in the general population (SMR 4.50, 95% CI = 2.02-10.01)., CONCLUSIONS: A reduced working ability, influenced by age-, injury- and lifestyle-related factors, is associated with long-term survival after TBI.

The association between anemia and the mortality of severe traumatic brain injury in emergency department.,"Yang, Chia-Jung; Hsiao, Kuang-Yu; Su, I-Chun; Chen, I-Chuan","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common medical problem for critically ill patients. Blood transfusion to augment oxygen delivery for these patients has been a traditional therapy. However, few studies have identified the impact of anemia on individuals suffering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effects of initial anemia on patients with severe TBI admitted to the Emergency Unit., METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with isolated severe TBI admitted to the Emergency Unit of a university hospital from July 2003 to June 2008. Patients were divided into two groups based on their initial anemia data taken while in the Emergency Unit. The anemia datum is defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <10 mg/dL. The t test was used to identify the differences between the two groups, while logistic regression was applied to determine any significant differences found in the statistical analysis., RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were signed up in our study. Based on their initial hemoglobin at emergency department, 23 patients (9.8%) comprised the anemia group, 17 patients (7.3%) comprised the nonanemia group, whereas 112 patients (47.9%) belonging to the nonanemia group were deceased. There is no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.076; odds ratio, 0.97; confidence interval, 0.78-1.05)., CONCLUSION: This study shows that initial anemia is not a mortality risk factor for patients with isolated severe blunt TBI.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,71,6,E132-5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31820ea36b,21427611,#9291,Yang 2011,,yes
Effect of secondary prehospital risk factors on outcome in severe traumatic brain injury in the context of fast access to trauma care.,"Franschman, Gaby; Peerdeman, Saskia M; Andriessen, Teuntje M J C; Greuters, Sjoerd; Toor, Annelies E; Vos, Pieter E; Bakker, Fred C; Loer, Stephan A; Boer, Christa; Amsterdam Lifeliner: Analysis of Results and Methods--Traumatic Brain Injury (ALARM-TBI) Investigators","BACKGROUND: Prevention of secondary prehospital risk factors such as hypoxia and hypotension is likely to improve patient prognosis in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because the Dutch trauma care organization is characterized by fast access to specialized trauma care due to the geographical situation, we investigated whether and to what extend secondary risk factors, such as hypoxia and hypotension, and measures, such as endotracheal intubation, affect outcome in severe TBI in the context of a region with fast access to trauma care., METHODS: The medical records of 339 subsequent computed tomography-confirmed patients with TBI with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score<=8 who were primarily referred to a Level I trauma center in Amsterdam or Nijmegen in the Netherlands were retrospectively analyzed., RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the strongest outcome predictors in our population were a disturbed pupillary reflex (odds ratio [OR], 5.8), a GCS score of 3 (OR, 4.9), and arterial hypotension (OR, 3.5). Interestingly, we observed no differences between intubated and nonintubated patients with respect to metabolic and respiratory parameters or mortality whereby the injury severity score was slightly higher in endotracheally intubated patients (32 [25-41]) versus nonintubated patients (25 [22-29])., CONCLUSION: In agreement with others, GCS, a disturbed pupil reflex, and arterial hypotension were predictive for the prognosis of primarily referred patients with severe TBI in the Netherlands.

Validation of the IMPACT outcome prediction score using the Nottingham Head Injury Register dataset.,"Yeoman, Paddy; Pattani, Hina; Silcocks, Paul; Owen, Victoria; Fuller, Gordon","BACKGROUND: Comparison of traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes is severely limited by the absence of a universally accepted and validated outcome prediction score. The IMPACT group recently reported models predicting mortality and unfavorable outcome after TBI, based on the outcomes of patients with moderate and severe head injury reported in two large clinical trials., METHODS: We have used prospectively collected data from 1,276 adult patients from the Nottingham Head Injury Register admitted to a single UK neurosurgical unit during a 10-year period to validate the IMPACT score models. The two models were validated for discrimination, calibration, and accuracy, using multiple imputation to adjust for missing data., RESULTS: One thousand sixty-one patients (83%) had a complete set of data. For the multiply imputed analysis, the IMPACT prognostic models showed satisfactory discrimination (area under the receiver operator curve for mortality, 0.835; 95% confidence interval, 0.811-0.858; unfavorable outcome, 0.828; 95% confidence interval, 0.805-0.851) and accuracy (Brier Accuracy Score for mortality, 0.403, p < 0.01; unfavorable outcome, 0.371, p < 0.01). Good calibration was evident for unfavorable outcome, but mortality risk was underestimated by the scoring system in our sample (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: mortality: p < 0.01; unfavorable outcome: p = 0.6). These results were not significantly changed when repeated using patients with complete data only., CONCLUSION: The 2005 IMPACT model for unfavorable outcome performs well when used to predict outcome in adults with moderate and severe TBI presenting to a British neurosurgical center.

We hypothesized that elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Bcl-2 and cytochrome C (CytoC) levels over time would reflect cellular injury response and predict long-term outcomes after TBI. Cerebrospinal fluid Bcl-2 and CytoC levels were measured for 6 days after injury for adults with severe TBI (N=76 subjects; N=277 samples). Group-based trajectory analysis was used to generate distinct temporal biomarker profiles that were compared with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores at 6 and 12 months after TBI. Subjects with persistently elevated temporal Bcl-2 and CytoC profiles compared with healthy controls had the worst outcomes at 6 and 12 months (P<=0.027). Those with CytoC profiles near controls had better long-term outcomes, and those with declining CytoC levels over time had intermediate outcomes. Subjects with Bcl-2 profiles that remained near controls had better outcomes than those with consistently elevated Bcl-2 profiles. However, subjects with Bcl-2 values that started near controls and steadily rose over time had 100% good outcomes by 12 months after TBI.

Results were correlated with the clinical assessment of injury severity as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale. The level of circulating endothelial progenitor cells was found to be suppressed 24-48 hrs after injury but rapidly increased, reaching the highest at days 5-7 post-trauma. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with improved Glasgow Coma Scale scores were significantly higher than those with deteriorated conditions and remained persistently low in patients who died of trauma., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the level of circulating endothelial progenitor cells correlates with the clinical severity and outcome of traumatic brain injury and may offer potential as a prognostic marker for traumatic brain injury.

Recent imaging advances made its diagnosis easier. Its prognosis impact is not yet well established. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic features of posttraumatic DAI and to study its prognosis impact on mortality and outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale., METHODS: This is a retrospective study over a 4-year period (2004-2007) of 124 patients admitted for head trauma. Demographic, clinical, biological, and radiologic findings were recorded at admission and during intensive care unit stay., RESULTS: Mean age (+/-standard deviation) was 28 years+/-15.8 years. Cranial computed tomography scan was sufficient enough to diagnose DAI in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 105 patients with a delay of 7.7 days+/-8.6 days. Most patients were classified as stage II (49.5%) or stage III (44.8%) according to Gentry's classification. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher mortality were dysautonomia (p=0.018; odds ratio [OR]=4.17), hyperglycemia>=8 mmol/L (p=0.001; OR=3.84) on intensive care unit admission, and subdural hematoma (p=0.031; OR=3.99), whereas factors associated to poor outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale score were Glasgow Coma Scale score<8 (p=0.032, OR=3.55), secondary systemic injuries score>=3 (p=0.034, OR=2.83), hyperglycemia>=8 mmol/L (p=0.002, OR=5.55), and DAI count>=6 (p=0.035, OR=3.33). In patients with pure DAI, the absence of consciousness recovery was the unique independent factor of mortality (p<0.001, OR=116.4), whereas only transfusion need was an independent factor of poor outcome (p=0.017, OR=4.44)., CONCLUSION: Dysautonomia, hyperglycemia, and subdural hematoma are the main factors associated to higher mortality when DAIs are diagnosed, whereas a DAI count>=6 is associated to poor outcome.

Spreading depolarizations have prolonged direct current shifts and are associated with poor outcome in brain trauma.,"Hartings, Jed A; Watanabe, Tomas; Bullock, M Ross; Okonkwo, David O; Fabricius, Martin; Woitzik, Johannes; Dreier, Jens P; Puccio, Ava; Shutter, Lori A; Pahl, Clemens; Strong, Anthony J; Co-Operative Study on Brain Injury Depolarizations","Cortical spreading depolarizations occur spontaneously after ischaemic, haemorrhagic and traumatic brain injury. Their effects vary spatially and temporally as graded phenomena, from infarction to complete recovery, and are reflected in the duration of depolarization measured by the negative direct current shift of electrocorticographic recordings. In the focal ischaemic penumbra, peri-infarct depolarizations have prolonged direct current shifts and cause progressive recruitment of the penumbra into the core infarct. In traumatic brain injury, the effects of spreading depolarizations are unknown, although prolonged events have not been observed in animal models. To determine whether detrimental penumbral-type depolarizations occur in human brain trauma, we analysed electrocorticographic recordings obtained by subdural electrode-strip monitoring during intensive care. Of 53 patients studied, 10 exhibited spreading depolarizations in an electrophysiologic penumbra (i.e. isoelectric cortex with no spontaneous activity). All 10 patients (100%) with isoelectric spreading depolarizations had poor outcomes, defined as death, vegetative state, or severe disability at 6 months. In contrast, poor outcomes were observed in 60% of patients (12/20) who had spreading depolarizations with depression of spontaneous activity and only 26% of patients (6/23) who had no depolarizations (chi2, P<0.001). Spontaneous electrocorticographic activity and direct current shifts of depolarizations were further examined in nine patients. Direct current shift durations (n=295) were distributed with a significant positive skew (range 0:51-16:19 min:s), evidencing a normally distributed group of short events and a sub-group of prolonged events. Prolonged direct current shifts were more commonly associated with isoelectric depolarizations (median 2 min 36 s), whereas shorter depolarizations occurred with depression of spontaneous activity (median 2 min 10 s; P<0.001). In the latter group, direct current shift durations correlated with electrocorticographic depression periods, and were longer when preceded by periodic epileptiform discharges than by continuous delta (0.5-4.0 Hz) or higher frequency activity. Prolonged direct current shifts (>3 min) also occurred mainly within temporal clusters of events. Our results show for the first time that spreading depolarizations are associated with worse clinical outcome after traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, based on animal models of brain injury, the prolonged durations of depolarizations raise the possibility that these events may contribute to maturation of cortical lesions. Prolonged depolarizations, measured by negative direct current shifts, were associated with (i) isoelectricity or periodic epileptiform discharges; (ii) prolonged depression of spontaneous activity and (iii) occurrence in temporal clusters. Depolarizations with these characteristics are likely to reflect a worse prognosis.",2011,/,Brain : a journal of neurology,134,Pt 5,1529-40,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr048,21478187,#9267,Hartings 2011,,yes

Comparative Assessment of the Prognostic Value of Biomarkers in Traumatic Brain Injury Reveals an Independent Role for Serum Levels of Neurofilament Light.,"Al Nimer, Faiez; Thelin, Eric; Nystrom, Harriet; Dring, Ann M; Svenningsson, Anders; Piehl, Fredrik; Nelson, David W; Bellander, Bo-Michael","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability, worldwide. Early determination of injury severity is essential to improve care. Neurofilament light (NF-L) has been introduced as a marker of neuroaxonal injury in neuroinflammatory/-degenerative diseases. In this study we determined the predictive power of serum (s-) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-) NF-L levels towards outcome, and explored their potential correlation to diffuse axonal injury (DAI). A total of 182 patients suffering from TBI admitted to the neurointensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center were included. S-NF-L levels were acquired, together with S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). CSF-NF-L was measured in a subcohort (n = 84) with ventriculostomies. Clinical and neuro-radiological parameters, including computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, were included in the analyses. Outcome was assessed 6 to 12 months after injury using the Glasgow Outcome Score (1-5). In univariate proportional odds analyses mean s-NF-L, -S100B and -NSE levels presented a pseudo-R2 Nagelkerke of 0.062, 0.214 and 0.074 in correlation to outcome, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, in addition to a model including core parameters (pseudo-R2 0.33 towards outcome; Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, pupil response, Stockholm CT score, abbreviated injury severity score, S100B), S-NF-L yielded an extra 0.023 pseudo-R2 and a significantly better model (p = 0.006) No correlation between DAI or CT assessed-intracranial damage and NF-L was found. Our study thus demonstrates that S-NF-L correlates to TBI outcome, even if used in models with S100B, indicating an independent contribution to the prediction, perhaps by reflecting different pathophysiological processes, not possible to monitor using conventional neuroradiology. Although we did not find a predictive value of NF-L for DAI, this cannot be completely excluded.

Stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with higher mortality in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Bosarge, Patrick L; Shoultz, Thomas H; Griffin, Russell L; Kerby, Jeffrey D","BACKGROUND: An association between stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) and increased mortality has been demonstrated following trauma. Experimental animal model data regarding the association between hyperglycemia and outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are inconsistent, suggesting that hyperglycemia may be harmful, neutral, or beneficial. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of SIH versus diabetic hyperglycemia (DH) on severe TBI., METHODS: Admission glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose levels, and comorbidity data were collected during a 4-year period from September 2009 to December 2013 for patients with severe TBI (i.e., admission Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 3-8 and head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score >= 3). Diabetes mellitus was determined by patient history or admission HbA1c of 6.5% or greater. SIH was determined by the absence of diabetes mellitus and admission glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater. A Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, injury mechanism, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SIH and the outcomes of interest., RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 626 patients were included in the study group, having severe TBI defined by both GCS score of 3 to 8 and head AIS score being 3 or greater and also had available HbA1c and admission glucose levels. A total of 184 patients were admitted with hyperglycemia; 152 patients (82.6%) were diagnosed with SIH, and 32 patients (17.4%) were diagnosed with DH. When comparing patients with severe TBI adjusted for age, sex, injury mechanism, ISS, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and lactic acid greater than 2.5 mmol/L, patients with SIH had a 50% increased mortality (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13-1.95) compared with the nondiabetic normoglycemia patients. DH patients did not have a significant increase in mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56-1.58)., CONCLUSION: SIH is associated with higher mortality after severe TBI. This association was not observed among patients with DH, which suggests that hyperglycemia related to diabetes is of less importance compared with SIH in terms of mortality in the acute trauma and TBI patient.

Comparison of predictability of Marshall and Rotterdam CT scan scoring system in determining early mortality after traumatic brain injury.,"Deepika, Akhil; Prabhuraj, A R; Saikia, Amrit; Shukla, Dhaval","BACKGROUND: Marshall computed tomographic (CT) classification is widely used as a predictor of outcome. However, this grading system lacks the following variables, which are found to be useful predictors: subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, extradural hematoma, and extent of basal cistern compression. A new classification called the Rotterdam grading system, incorporating the above variables, was proposed later. In the original paper, this system was found to have superior discrimination as compared to Marshall grading, however, Rotterdam grading has not been validated widely. We aimed to compare the discriminatory power of both grading systems., METHODS: This is a prospective study of patients with moderate and severe TBI (Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 3-12) who presented to our casualty. All the patients were followed up for 2 weeks to determine early mortality. The discriminatory power of each grading system was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)., RESULTS: A total of 134 patients, mean age 38.3 (+/-15.7) years, were recruited for study. The overall mortality was 11.2 %. The mean GCS of these patients was 9.6 (+/-2.3). There was good correlation between Marshall and Rotterdam grading, r = 0.68 (significant at 0.01 level). The Marshall CT classification had reasonable discrimination (AUC - 0.707), and Rotterdam grading had good discrimination (AUC - 0.681)., CONCLUSIONS: Both Marshal and Rotterdam grading systems are good in predicting early mortality after moderate and severe TBI. As the Rotterdam system also includes additional variables like subarachnoid hemorrhage, it may be preferable, particularly in patients with diffuse injury.",2015,/,Acta neurochirurgica,157,11,Aug-33,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-015-2575-5,26374440,#7075,Deepika 2015,,yes
Predictors of global functioning and employment 10 years following traumatic brain injury compared with orthopaedic injury.,"Dahm, Jane; Ponsford, Jennie","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate predictors of global functioning and employment 10 years following traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared with orthopaedic trauma., RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective cohort., METHODS: Ninety-seven individuals with complicated mild-to-severe TBI and 91 with traumatic orthopaedic injury were followed-up at 10 years post-injury. Global functioning (GOS-E) and employment status were recorded., RESULTS: Groups did not differ on global functioning or employment status. Post-TBI, shorter PTA and less severe orthopaedic injuries were associated with better global functioning; and shorter PTA and younger age were associated with employment. Following traumatic orthopaedic injury, younger age was associated with employment, but not after excluding individuals no longer in the labour force., CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, demographic factors and injury severity contribute to long-term outcomes following TBI, but not orthopaedic trauma. PTA continues to influence outcomes 10 years following TBI. There is ongoing detrimental influence of orthopaedic injuries on global functioning for individuals with TBI, suggesting a potential benefit in greater clinical attention to these injuries.

Predictive value of hyperthermia and intracranial hypertension on neurological outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Bonds, Brandon W; Hu, Peter; Li, Yao; Yang, Shiming; Colton, Katharine; Gonchigar, Anish; Cheriyan, Jerry; Grissom, Thomas; Fang, Raymond; Stein, Deborah M","BACKGROUND: Intracranial hypertension (ICH) and hyperthermia are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and associated with worse neurological outcomes. This study sets out to determine the combined power of temperature and intracranial pressure (ICP) for predicting neurologic outcomes and prolonged length of stay (LOS) following severe TBI., METHODS: High resolution (every 6 seconds) temperature and ICP data were collected in adults with severe TBI from 2008-2010. Temperatures were plotted against concurrent ICP and divided based on breakpoints (Temperature: <36, 36-38.5 or >38.5 degreeC, ICP: <20, 20-30 or >30 mmHg). The percentage of time spent in each section, as well as several pooled unfavourable conditions (hyperthermia +/- ICH), were then evaluated for predictive value for ICU-LOS > 7 days and short-term (<6 months) vs. long-term (>6 months) dichotomized neurologic outcomes., RESULTS: Fifty patients were included for analysis with severe TBI. Evaluation of the area under the operating receiver curve (AUC) showed significant periods of fever and high ICP (<30 mmHg) had a strong association with poor long-term neurological outcomes (Day 3, AUC = 0.71, p = 0.04) and were higher than either condition alone.

High levels of serum mannose-binding lectins are associated with the severity and clinical outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Yu, Wei; Le, Hai-Wei; Lu, Yi-Gao; Hu, Jun-An; Yu, Jian-Bo; Wang, Ming; Shen, Wei","BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key component of innate immunity. The expression of cortical MBL is up-regulated after clinical and experimental head trauma. This study aimed to assess the association of serum MBL levels with injury severity and long-term clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury (STBI)., METHODS: Serum MBL levels were measured in 122 patients and 100 healthy controls. Multivariate analyses were used to analyze the relationship between serum MBL levels and trauma severity reflected by Glasgow Coma Scale scores as well as between serum MBL levels and 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score: 1-3). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was structured to evaluate the prognostic predictive performance of serum MBL levels., RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, serum MBL levels of patients were markedly elevated. Using multivariate analyses, serum MBL levels were found to be associated closely with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and MBL emerged as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome. Under ROC curve, serum MBL levels and GCS scores possessed similar prognostic predictive values., CONCLUSION: Increased serum level of MBL was independently associated with head trauma severity and long-term clinical outcomes of STBI.

We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify independent predictors of GCSE in patients with TBI and to determine the impact of GCSE on outcomes (in-hospital mortality, length of stay, total hospital charges, and discharge disposition)., RESULTS: Among 1,457,869 patients hospitalized with TBI, 2315 (0.16%) had GCSE. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with GCSE (32.5% vs. 9.6%; unadjusted OR 4.54, 95% CI 4.16-4.96; p<0.001; adjusted OR 3.41; 95% CI 3.09-3.76 p<0.001). Patients with GCSE had longer length of stay (17.3 +/- 21.9 vs. 6.8 +/- 11.1 days; p<0.001), higher total hospital charges ($147,415 +/- 162,319 vs. $54,041 +/- 90,524; p<0.001), and were less likely to be discharged home (19.8% vs. 52.7%; p<0.001). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, age >35 years (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.87-2.47), CNS infections (OR 4.86; 95% CI 3.70-6.38), anoxic brain injury (OR 9.54; 95% CI 8.10-11.22), and acute ischemic stroke (OR 4.09; 95% CI 3.41-4.87) were independent predictors of GCSE in TBI patients. Epilepsy was an independent negative predictor of GCSE (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55-0.99)., CONCLUSION: Despite its low incidence, GCSE in TBI patients was associated with worse outcomes with threefold higher in-hospital mortality, prolonged hospitalization, higher hospital charges, and worse discharge disposition.

Its increased circulating concentrations are associated with the severity and prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. In-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs), including acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction, are correlated with mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to investigate the changes of plasma nesfatin-1 concentrations and further assess its association with inflammation, trauma severity, in-hospital mortality and IMAEs following TBI., METHODS: We measured plasma nesfatin-1 concentrations of 100 severe TBI patients and 100 controls. Progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction were diagnosed based on a follow-up computerized tomography scan. Acute traumatic coagulopathy was identified according to a coagulation test., RESULTS: Plasma nesfatin-1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in controls and associated highly with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores and plasma C-reactive protein concentrations. Nesfatin-1 was indicated as an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality and IMAEs. In accordance with area under receiver operating characteristic curve, its predictive value was similar to GCS scores., CONCLUSION: Increased plasma nesfatin-1 concentrations are associated closely with inflammation, trauma severity and clinical outcomes, indicating that nesfatin-1 might be involved in inflammation and become a good prognostic biomarker following TBI.

TCD was performed upon admission in 356 patients (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS], 9 to 15) with mild lesions on cerebral computed tomography scan. Normal TCD was defined as a pulsatility index of less than 1.25 and diastolic blood flow velocity higher than 25 cm/s in the two middle cerebral arteries. The primary endpoint was secondary neurologic deterioration on day 7., RESULTS: Twenty patients (6%) developed secondary neurologic deterioration within the first posttraumatic week. TCD thresholds had 80% sensitivity (95% CI, 56 to 94%) and 79% specificity (95% CI, 74 to 83%) to predict neurologic worsening. The negative predictive values and positive predictive values of TCD were 98% (95% CI, 96 to 100%) and 18% (95% CI, 11to 28%), respectively. In patients with minor traumatic brain injury (GCS, 14 to 15), the sensitivity and specificity of TCD were 91% (95% CI, 59 to 100%) and 80% (95% CI, 75 to 85%), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of a multivariate predictive model including age and GCS was significantly improved with the adjunction of TCD. Patients with abnormal TCD on admission (n = 86 patients) showed a more altered score for the disability rating scale on day 28 compared to those with normal TCD (n = 257 patients)., CONCLUSIONS: TCD measurements upon admission may provide additional information about neurologic outcome after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.

A Comparative Study of Glasgow Coma Scale and Full Outline of Unresponsiveness Scores for Predicting Long-Term Outcome After Brain Injury.,"McNett, Molly M; Amato, Shelly; Philippbar, Sue Ann","PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare predictive ability of hospital Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and scores obtained using a novel coma scoring tool (the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness [FOUR] scale) on long-term outcomes among patients with traumatic brain injury. Preliminary research of the FOUR scale suggests that it is comparable with GCS for predicting mortality and functional outcome at hospital discharge. No research has investigated relationships between coma scores and outcome 12 months postinjury., METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study. Data were gathered on adult patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to urban level I trauma center. GCS and FOUR scores were assigned at 24 and 72 hours and at hospital discharge. Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were assigned at 6 and 12 months., RESULTS: The sample size was n = 107. Mean age was 53.5 (SD = +/-21, range = 18-91) years. Spearman correlations were comparable and strongest among discharge GCS and FOUR scores and 12-month outcome (r = .73, p < .000; r = .72, p < .000). Multivariate regression models indicate that age and discharge GCS were the strongest predictors of outcome.

Blood mitochondrial enzymatic assay as a predictor of long-term outcome in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Sinha, Sumit; Raheja, Amol; Samson, Neha; Bhoi, Sanjeev; Selvi, Arul; Sharma, Pushpa; Sharma, Bhawani Shankar","Recent studies have observed the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). One hundred and seven sTBI patients (18-65years old, presenting within 8hours of injury) were randomised for a placebo controlled phase II trial of progesterone with or without hypothermia. We serially analysed blood mitochondrial enzymes (Complex I [C1], Complex IV [C4] and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [PDH]) using a dipstick assay at admission and 7days later for 37 patients, irrespective of assigned group. Favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 1year was associated with admission C1 levels above 0.19mug, admission C4 levels above 0.19mug and day 7 C1 levels above 0.17mug, all per 25mul of blood. Unfavorable GOS at 1year was associated with admission serum PDH levels above 0.23mug/25mul of blood. Survivors at 1year had significantly higher admission serum C1 levels above 0.19mug/25mul and day 7 C1 levels above 0.17mug/25mul. To our knowledge this is the first clinical trial associating blood mitochondrial enzymes with long-term outcome in sTBI. Serial monitoring and optimisation of blood C1, C4 and PDH levels could aid in prognostication and potentially guide in using mitochondrial targeted therapies.

Sex differences in mortality following isolated traumatic brain injury among older adults.,"Albrecht, Jennifer S; McCunn, Maureen; Stein, Deborah M; Simoni-Wastila, Linda; Smith, Gordon S","BACKGROUND: Older adults have the highest rates of hospitalization and mortality from traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet outcomes in this population are not well studied. In particular, contradictory reports on the protective effect of female sex on mortality following TBI may have been related to age differences in TBI and other injury severity and mechanism. The objective of this study was to determine if there are sex differences in mortality following isolated TBI among older adults and compare with findings using all TBI. A secondary objective was to characterize TBI severity and mechanism by sex in this population., METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted among adults aged 65 and older treated for TBI at a single large Level I trauma center from 1996 to 2012 (n = 4,854). Individuals treated for TBI were identified using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Isolated TBI was defined as an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 0 for other body regions. Our primary outcome was mortality at discharge., RESULTS: Among those with isolated TBI (n = 1,320), women (45% of sample) were older (mean [SD], 78.9 [7.7] years) than men (76.8 [7.5] years) (p < 0.001). Women were more likely to have been injured in a fall (91% vs. 84%; p < 0.001). Adjusting for multiple injury severity measures, female sex was not significantly associated with decreased odds of mortality following isolated TBI (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.54). Using all TBI cases, adjusted analysis found that female sex was significantly associated with decreased odd of mortality (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.89)., CONCLUSION: We found no sex differences in mortality following isolated TBI among older adults, in contrast with other studies and our own analyses using all TBI cases.

The patients with delayed tIVH are significantly older (57.39 vs. 48.63 years, p = 0.009) and developed statistically significant more frequent enlargement of an existing lesion (47.4 vs. 20.2 %, p = 0.001) and appearance of a new lesion (100 vs. 33.7 %, p < 0.001). Delayed tIVH appeared significantly more frequent in surgically treated patients with ICH as a main surgical lesion (p = 0.010) and is associated with significantly higher mortality (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Delayed tIVH as a progression of injury in moderate-to-severe TBI has a relatively high occurrence and is associated with increased mortality. The only factor independently related to a new appearance of tIVH is the presence of ICH as a main surgical lesion on the control preoperative CT scans.",2016,/,Acta neurochirurgica,158,8,1465-72,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-016-2854-9,27294774,#6647,Laleva 2016,,yes
"Association Between Comorbidities, Nutritional Status, and Anticlotting Drugs and Neurologic Outcomes in Geriatric Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.","Okazaki, Tomoya; Hifumi, Toru; Kawakita, Kenya; Nakashima, Ryuta; Matsumoto, Atsushi; Shishido, Hajime; Ogawa, Daiske; Okauchi, Masanobu; Shindo, Atsushi; Kawanishi, Masahiko; Tamiya, Takashi; Kuroda, Yasuhiro","BACKGROUND: Several studies using trauma data banks and registers showed that age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score, and intraventricular hemorrhage were independent factors for neurologic outcomes in geriatric patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, these analyses did not comprehensively evaluate factors particularly associated with geriatric patients. We aimed to identify factors particularly associated with geriatric patients that affect neurologic outcomes in TBI., METHODS: Patients aged >=65 years who were hospitalized consecutively in Kagawa University Hospital with severe TBI between 1 January 2008 and 31 October 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated background factors particularly associated with geriatric patients, including comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), nutritional status (serum albumin level), and presence/absence of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, in addition to baseline characteristics. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of unfavorable neurologic outcomes (UO), as defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3 at discharge from hospital. The association between CCI and UO was evaluated in a subgroup analysis., RESULTS: UO occurred in 65.0% of 140 patients. Multivariate analyses showed that the CCI (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-3.29; P = 0.011), age, and GCS were independent predictors of UO. In subgroup analyses of patients with an initial GCS score of 13-15, the rate of UO significantly increased with CCI score (CCI 0, 35.5%; CCI 1 or 2, 39.4%; CCI >2, 83.3%; P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: CCI was an independent predictor of UO in geriatric patients with severe TBI.

The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Prediction of Minimally Conscious State After Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Xu, Weiwei; Kaur, Harpreet; Wang, Xiangyu; Li, Hengguo","OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple and feasible model of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prediction of minimally conscious state in unconscious patients (>=2 weeks) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: MRI examinations were performed in 73 patients 4.5 weeks +/- 1.6 (range, 2-8 weeks) after TBI. Brain lesions on MRI, age, sex, cause of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and decompressive craniectomy were retrospectively analyzed. Outcome was assessed at 12 months from the onset of TBI., RESULTS: Of 73 patients, 39 were minimally conscious and 34 were unconscious at the endpoint. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that cause of injury (P = 0.036), GCS score (P = 0.011), and lesions of the thalamus (P = 0.002) and brainstem (P = 0.012) shown on MRI were closely associated with the outcome of minimally conscious state. The overall correct prediction of the logistic model was 90.4%., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MRI findings and other clinical data offers neurosurgeons substantial information about primary and secondary injuries of the patients with TBI, which allows a more accurate prediction of prognosis than a single GCS score or MRI findings alone. The regression model established in this study is simple and effective in predicting long-term unconscious state and minimally conscious state in patients after severe TBI.

Role of Intracranial Pressure Monitoring in Management of Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Results of a Large Level I Trauma Center in Southern Iran.,"Khalili, Hosseinali; Sadraei, Nazanin; Niakan, Amin; Ghaffarpasand, Fariborz; Sadraei, Amin","OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to a large level I trauma center in Southern Iran., METHODS: This was a cohort study performed during a 2-year period in a level I trauma center in Southern Iran including all adult patients (>16 years) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, 3-8) who underwent ICP monitoring through ventriculostomy. The management was based on the recorded ICP values with threshold of 20 mm Hg. Decompressive craniectomy was performed in patients with intractable intracranial hypertension (persistent ICP >=25 mm Hg). In unresponsive patients, barbiturate coma was induced. Patients were followed for 6 months and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended was recorded. The determinants of favorable and unfavorable outcome were also determined., RESULTS: Overall, we included 248 patients with mean age of 34.6 +/- 16.6 years, among whom there were 216 men (87.1%) and 32 women (12.9%). Eighty-five patients (34.2%) had favorable and 163 (65.8%) unfavorable outcomes. Those with favorable outcome had significantly lower age (P = 0.004), higher GCS score on admission (P < 0.001), lower Rotterdam score (P = 0.035), fewer episodes of intracranial hypertension (P < 0.001), and lower maximum recorded ICP (P = 0.041). These factors remained statistically significant after elimination of confounders by multivariate logistic regression model., CONCLUSIONS: Age, GCS score on admission, Rotterdam score, intracranial hypertension, and maximum recorded ICP are important determinants of outcome in patients with severe TBI. ICP monitoring assisted us in targeted therapy and management of patients with severe TBI. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Prognostic models for predicting posttraumatic seizures during acute hospitalization, and at 1 and 2 years following traumatic brain injury.","Ritter, Anne C; Wagner, Amy K; Szaflarski, Jerzy P; Brooks, Maria M; Zafonte, Ross D; Pugh, Mary Jo V; Fabio, Anthony; Hammond, Flora M; Dreer, Laura E; Bushnik, Tamara; Walker, William C; Brown, Allen W; Johnson-Greene, Doug; Shea, Timothy; Krellman, Jason W; Rosenthal, Joseph A","OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic seizures (PTS) are well-recognized acute and chronic complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Risk factors have been identified, but considerable variability in who develops PTS remains. Existing PTS prognostic models are not widely adopted for clinical use and do not reflect current trends in injury, diagnosis, or care. We aimed to develop and internally validate preliminary prognostic regression models to predict PTS during acute care hospitalization, and at year 1 and year 2 postinjury., METHODS: Prognostic models predicting PTS during acute care hospitalization and year 1 and year 2 post-injury were developed using a recent (2011-2014) cohort from the TBI Model Systems National Database. Potential PTS predictors were selected based on previous literature and biologic plausibility. Bivariable logistic regression identified variables with a p-value < 0.20 that were used to fit initial prognostic models. Multivariable logistic regression modeling with backward-stepwise elimination was used to determine reduced prognostic models and to internally validate using 1,000 bootstrap samples. Fit statistics were calculated, correcting for overfitting (optimism)., RESULTS: The prognostic models identified sex, craniotomy, contusion load, and pre-injury limitation in learning/remembering/concentrating as significant PTS predictors during acute hospitalization. Significant predictors of PTS at year 1 were subdural hematoma (SDH), contusion load, craniotomy, craniectomy, seizure during acute hospitalization, duration of posttraumatic amnesia, preinjury mental health treatment/psychiatric hospitalization, and preinjury incarceration. Year 2 significant predictors were similar to those of year 1: SDH, intraparenchymal fragment, craniotomy, craniectomy, seizure during acute hospitalization, and preinjury incarceration. Corrected concordance (C) statistics were 0.599, 0.747, and 0.716 for acute hospitalization, year 1, and year 2 models, respectively., SIGNIFICANCE: The prognostic model for PTS during acute hospitalization did not discriminate well. Year 1 and year 2 models showed fair to good predictive validity for PTS. Cranial surgery, although medically necessary, requires ongoing research regarding potential benefits of increased monitoring for signs of epileptogenesis, PTS prophylaxis, and/or rehabilitation/social support.

The extent and nature of recovery in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are usually heterogeneous and not substantially explained by the commonly known demographic and injury-related prognostic factors despite having sustained similar injuries or injury severity. Hence, this study evaluated the effects and association of the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) missense mutations in relation to neurocognitive performance among patients with mTBI. 48 patients with mTBI were prospectively recruited and MRI scans of the brain were performed within an average 10.1 (SD 4.2) hours post trauma with assessment of their neuropsychological performance post full Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) recovery. Neurocognitive assessments were repeated again at 6 months follow-up. The paired t-test, Cohen's d effect size and repeated measure ANOVA were performed to delineate statistically significant differences between the groups [wildtype G allele (Val homozygotes) vs. minor A allele (Met carriers)] and their neuropsychological performance across the time point (T1 = baseline/ admission vs. T2 = 6th month follow-up). Minor A allele carriers in this study generally performed more poorly on neuropsychological testing in comparison wildtype G allele group at both time points. Significant mean differences were observed among the wildtype group in the domains of memory (M = -11.44, SD = 10.0, p = .01, d = 1.22), executive function (M = -11.56, SD = 11.7, p = .02, d = 1.05) and overall performance (M = -6.89 SD = 5.3, p = .00, d = 1.39), while the minor A allele carriers showed significant mean differences in the domains of attention (M = -11.0, SD = 13.1, p = .00, d = .86) and overall cognitive performance (M = -5.25, SD = 8.1, p = .01, d = .66). The minor A allele carriers in comparison to the wildtype G allele group, showed considerably lower scores at admission and remained impaired in most domains across the timepoints, although delayed signs of recovery were noted to be significant in the domains attention and overall cognition. In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated the role of the BDNF rs6265 Val66Met polymorphism in influencing specific neurocognitive outcomes in patients with mTBI.

Time course of cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory biomarkers and relationship to 6-month neurologic outcome in adult severe traumatic brain injury.,"Nwachuku, Enyinna L; Puccio, Ava M; Adeboye, Adeolu; Chang, Yue-Fang; Kim, Jinho; Okonkwo, David O","OBJECTIVE: Activation of the inflammatory cascade is a known pathophysiologic process in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) with yet non-standardized scientific data regarding relationship to outcome. The understanding of the time course of expression of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels following severe TBI is an important step toward using these biomarkers to measure injury severity and/or early response to therapeutic interventions. The objective of the current study is to report the time course and values of a battery of CSF inflammatory biomarkers following severe TBI in our reasonably sized patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our patient cohort consists of 32 consented patients, who met the study's inclusion criteria for data collection from 2000 to 2010. The time course and values of a battery of CSF biomarkers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12p70, IL-10, and IL-8) following severe TBI in this patient cohort was characterized. Additionally, the correlation of biomarker concentration with 6-month neurological outcome was assessed. Serial CSF sampling through an external ventricular drain was performed over the first five days following injury. Concentration of a panel of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12p70, IL-10, and IL-8) were evaluated using Meso Scale Discovery's Multi-Array technology. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at six months following injury was dichotomized into poor outcome (GOS 1-3) and favorable outcome (GOS 4-5). Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression analysis., RESULTS: The result shows that CSF concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers had a significant association with 6-month neurological outcome (p-values<=0.05 for each marker), with the favorable outcome group having lower concentrations of these biomarkers on average, in comparison to the poor neurologic outcome group over the first five days after TBI. All inflammatory biomarkers decreased to normal levels by post-trauma day 5, except for IL-6 and IL-8. Upregulation and increased expression of key inflammatory markers following severe TBI were significant predictors of worse 6-month neurologic outcome. Additionally, post-trauma day 5 concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 remained elevated over normal CSF values., CONCLUSION: The study shows that inflammatory biomarkers in CSF are potential biomarkers of injury severity and progression and/or recovery; they could prove beneficial in the future assessment of injury severity and response to therapy after severe TBI.

Head Injury in the Elderly: What Are the Outcomes of Neurosurgical Care?.,"Whitehouse, Kathrin Joanna; Jeyaretna, Deva Sanjeeva; Enki, Doyo Gragn; Whitfield, Peter C","BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that an increasing proportion of those presenting with head trauma are elderly. This study details the outcomes of elderly patients with head trauma admitted to a regional United Kingdom neurosurgical unit., METHODS: The notes and imaging were reviewed of all patients with head injury aged >=75 years, admitted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2010, including mortality data up to at least 2 years after discharge. Outcomes comprised death as an inpatient, by 30 days and 1 year after discharge; Glasgow Outcome Score; discharge Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score; recurrence; readmission; reoperation; and complication., RESULTS: A total of 263 patients were admitted: 26 with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH); 175 with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH); and 46 with mixed subdural collections (ACSDH). Sixteen patients had other head injury diagnoses. Patients with ASDH had a significantly lower survival rate than did those with CSDH or ACSDH: the odds of inpatient death for patients with ASDH was 15.38 (vs. those with CSDH). For all subdural hematomas (SDHs), low American Society of Anesthesiologists score was an independent predictor of early death. Death at 1 year was predicted by head injury severity measured by admission GCS score (P = 0.028), long anesthetic (P = 0.002), and the presence of bilateral SDH (P = 0.002). Unfavorable Glasgow Outcome Scale score (1-3) was predicted by age greater than 85 years (P = 0.029); larger depth of subdural (P < 0.001); and presence of any complication (P = 0.003). Those aged greater than 90 years with presentation GCS score lower than 10 all had poor outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Most elderly patients admitted under neurosurgery after head injury have SDHs. Our results are better than many previously reported; however, the rate of death for those with ASDH is still high. Crown Copyright Â© 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Early expression of serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is associated with neurological severity immediately after traumatic brain injury.,"Zhao, Jinbing; Chen, Haodong; Zhang, Meijuan; Zhang, Yuhai; Qian, Chunfa; Liu, Yong; He, Shengxue; Zou, Yuanjie; Liu, Hongyi","PURPOSE: Intracranial bleeding and inflammatory reactions are common consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an iron-handling and acute phase protein, may participate in the pathogenesis of TBI. Therefore, we hypothesize that NGAL may be of high diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in the prognosis of TBI., METHODS: 74 subjects were recruited in this study. 30 TBI patients receiving emergent operation were designated as severe TBI group (sTBI), 24 TBI patients receiving conservative treatment as mild TBI group (mTBI), while 20 age-matched healthy volunteers as healthy controls (CNT). We detected the expression and localization of NGAL in brain tissue by Q-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Serum NGAL was evaluated by ELISA. Clinical manifestations and outcomes were measured by Glasgow Score (GCS), Trauma score (TS), Revised Trauma score (RTS), APACHEII, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 85 at admission. Glasgow outcome score (GOS) and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) were documented at discharge., RESULTS: NGAL mRNA and protein levels in brain tissue from sTBI group were profoundly higher than control tissue. Double labeled NGAL with GFAP, NeuN and Iba-1 by immunofluroscence demonstrated that increased NGAL was mainly located in neurons. Compared to CNT and mTBI groups, serum NGAL were significantly increased in sTBI group (sTBI: 532.6+/-71.77ng/ml vs. mTBI: 230.5+/-29.59ng/ml, p<0.01; sTBI: 532.6+/-71.77ng/ml vs. CNT 178.0+/-19.83ng/ml, p<0.01). Linear regression analysis indicated that there was a negative correlation between the NGAL levels and GCS (r=-0.427, p=0.033), TS (r=-0.429, p=0.032), RTS (r=-0.413, p=0.040) in sTBI group. However, NGAL levels did not correlated with GOS and KPS scores. The NAGL cut-off value of 244.13ng/ml yielded good sensitivity at 84% and specificity at 78.9%., CONCLUSION: NGAL may be a novel biomarker reflecting TBI severity, which increased obviously and negatively correlated with GCS, TS, and RTS scores; additionally, this characteristic of NGAL may be helpful in guiding clinical TBI therapeutic strategies.

"Utility of neuron-specific enolase in traumatic brain injury; relations to S100B levels, outcome, and extracranial injury severity.","Thelin, Eric Peter; Jeppsson, Emma; Frostell, Arvid; Svensson, Mikael; Mondello, Stefania; Bellander, Bo-Michael; Nelson, David W","BACKGROUND: In order to improve assessment and outcome prediction in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebral protein levels in serum have been suggested as biomarkers of injury. However, despite much investigation, biomarkers have yet to reach broad clinical utility in TBI. This study is a 9-year follow-up and clinical experience of the two most studied proteins, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100B, in a neuro-intensive care TBI population. Our aims were to investigate to what extent NSE and S100B, independently and in combination, could predict outcome, assess injury severity, and to investigate if the biomarker levels were influenced by extracranial factors., METHODS: All patients treated at the neuro-intensive care unit at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden between 2005 and 2013 with at least three measurements of serum S100B and NSE (sampled twice daily) were retrospectively included. In total, 417 patients fulfilled the criteria. Parameters were extracted from the computerized hospital charts. Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was used to assess long-term functional outcome. Univariate, and multivariate, regression models toward outcome and what explained the high levels of the biomarkers were performed. Nagelkerke's pseudo-R(2) was used to illustrate the explained variance of the different models. A sliding window assessed biomarker correlation to outcome and multitrauma over time., RESULTS: S100B was found a better predictor of outcome as compared to NSE (area under the curve (AUC) samples, the first 48 hours had Nagelkerke's pseudo-R(2) values of 0.132 and 0.038, respectively), where the information content of S100B peaks at approximately 1 day after trauma. In contrast, although both biomarkers were independently correlated to outcome, NSE had limited additional predictive capabilities in the presence of S100B in multivariate models, due to covariance between the two biomarkers (correlation coefficient 0.673 for AUC 48 hours). Moreover, NSE was to a greater extent correlated to multitrauma the first 48 hours following injury, whereas the effect of extracerebral trauma on S100B levels appears limited to the first 12 hours., CONCLUSIONS: While both biomarkers are independently correlated to long-term functional outcome, S100B is found a more accurate outcome predictor and possibly a more clinically useful biomarker than NSE for TBI patients.",2016,/,"Critical care (London, England)",20,9801902,285,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-016-1450-y,27604350,#6568,Thelin 2016,,yes
Oxidation-Reduction Potential as a Biomarker for Severity and Acute Outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Bjugstad, Kimberly B; Rael, Leonard T; Levy, Stewart; Carrick, Matthew; Mains, Charles W; Slone, Denetta S; Bar-Or, David","There are few reliable markers for assessing traumatic brain injury (TBI). Elevated levels of oxidative stress have been observed in TBI patients. We hypothesized that oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) could be a potent biomarker in TBI. Two types of ORP were measured in patient plasma samples: the static state of oxidative stress (sORP) and capacity for induced oxidative stress (icORP). Differences in ORP values as a function of time after injury, severity, and hospital discharge were compared using ANOVAs with significance at p <= 0.05. Logit regression analyses were used to predict acute outcome comparing ORP, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Antioxidant capacity (icORP) on day 4 was prognostic for acute outcomes (p < 0.05). An odds ratio of 4.08 was associated with poor acute outcome when icORP > 7.25 muC. IcORP was a better predictor than ISS, AIS, or GCS scores. sORP increased in those with the highest ISS values (p < 0.05). Based on these findings ORP is useful biomarker for severity and acute outcome in TBI patients. Changes in ORP values on day 4 after injury were the most prognostic, suggesting that patients' response to brain injury over time is a factor that determines outcome.",2016,/,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2016,101479826,6974257,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/6974257,27642494,#6555,Bjugstad 2016,,yes
Serum neurofilament light protein predicts clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury.,"Shahim, Pashtun; Gren, Magnus; Liman, Victor; Andreasson, Ulf; Norgren, Niklas; Tegner, Yelverton; Mattsson, Niklas; Andreasen, Niels; Ost, Martin; Zetterberg, Henrik; Nellgard, Bengt; Blennow, Kaj","Axonal white matter injury is believed to be a major determinant of adverse outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that measurement of neurofilament light protein (NF-L), a protein found in long white-matter axons, in blood samples, may serve as a suitable biomarker for neuronal damage in TBI patients. To test our hypotheses, we designed a study in two parts: i) we developed an immunoassay based on Single molecule array technology for quantification of NF-L in blood, and ii) in a proof-of-concept study, we tested our newly developed method on serial serum samples from severe TBI (sTBI) patients (n = 72) and controls (n = 35). We also compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of NF-L with the established blood biomarker S100B. NF-L levels were markedly increased in sTBI patients compared with controls. NF-L at admission yielded an AUC of 0.99 to detect TBI versus controls (AUC 0.96 for S100B), and increased to 1.00 at day 12 (0.65 for S100B).

Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein and Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase-L1 as Outcome Predictors in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Takala, Riikka S K; Posti, Jussi P; Runtti, Hilkka; Newcombe, Virginia F; Outtrim, Joanne; Katila, Ari J; Frantzen, Janek; Ala-Seppala, Henna; Kyllonen, Anna; Maanpaa, Henna-Riikka; Tallus, Jussi; Hossain, Md Iftakher; Coles, Jonathan P; Hutchinson, Peter; van Gils, Mark; Menon, David K; Tenovuo, Olli","OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may help detect brain injury, assess its severity, and improve outcome prediction. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of these biomarkers during the first days after brain injury., METHODS: Serum UCH-L1 and GFAP were measured in 324 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) enrolled in a prospective study. The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or the extended version, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)., RESULTS: Patients with full recovery had lower UCH-L1 concentrations on the second day and patients with favorable outcome had lower UCH-L1 concentrations during the first 2 days compared with patients with incomplete recovery and unfavorable outcome. Patients with full recovery and favorable outcome had significantly lower GFAP concentrations in the first 2 days than patients with incomplete recovery or unfavorable outcome. There was a strong negative correlation between outcome and UCH-L1 in the first 3 days and GFAP levels in the first 2 days. On arrival, both UCH-L1 and GFAP distinguished patients with GOS score 1-3 from patients with GOS score 4-5, but not patients with GOSE score 8 from patients with GOSE score 1-7. For UCH-L1 and GFAP to predict unfavorable outcome (GOS score <= 3), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.727, and 0.723, respectively. Neither UCHL-1 nor GFAP was independently able to predict the outcome when age, worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupil reactivity, Injury Severity Score, and Marshall score were added into the multivariate logistic regression model., CONCLUSIONS: GFAP and UCH-L1 are significantly associated with outcome, but they do not add predictive power to commonly used prognostic variables in a population of patients with TBI of varying severities.

Cerebrovascular Signal Complexity Six Hours after Intensive Care Unit Admission Correlates with Outcome after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Gao, Lei; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek; Ercole, Ari","Disease states are associated with a breakdown in healthy interactions and are often characterized by reduced signal complexity. We applied approximate entropy (ApEn) analysis to investigate the correlation between the complexity of heart rate (ApEn-HR), mean arterial pressure (ApEn-MAP), intracranial pressure (ApEn-ICP), and a combined ApEn-product (product of the three individual ApEns) and outcome after traumatic brain injury. In 174 severe traumatic brain injured patients, we found significant differences across groups classified by the Glasgow Outcome Score in ApEn-HR (p = 0.007), ApEn-MAP (p = 0.02), ApEn-ICP (p = 0.01), ApEn-product (p = 0.001), and pressure reactivity index (PRx) (p = 0.004) in the first 6 h. This relationship strengthened in a 24 h and 72 h analysis (ApEn-MAP continued to correlate with death but was not correlated with favorable outcome). Outcome was dichotomized as survival versus death, and favorable versus unfavorable; the ApEn-product achieved the strongest statistical significance at 6 h (F = 11.0; p = 0.001 and F = 10.5; p = 0.001, respectively) and was a significant independent predictor of mortality and favorable outcome (p < 0.001). Patients in the lowest quartile for ApEn-product were over four times more likely to die (39.5% vs. 9.3%, p < 0.001) than those in the highest quartile. ApEn-ICP was inversely correlated with PRx (r = -0.39, p < 0.000001) indicating unique information related to impaired cerebral autoregulation. Our results demonstrate that as early as 6 h into monitoring, complexity measures from easily attainable vital signs, such as HR and MAP, in addition to ICP, can help triage those who require more intensive neurological management at an early stage.",2016,/,Journal of neurotrauma,33,22,2011-2018,,,26916703,#6505,Gao 2016,,yes
"Outcome, Pressure Reactivity and Optimal Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Calculation in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comparison of Two Variants.","Lang, Erhard W; Kasprowicz, Magdalena; Smielewski, Peter; Santos, Edgar; Pickard, John; Czosnyka, Marek","This study investigates the outcome prediction and calculation of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) in 307 patients after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) based on cerebrovascular reactivity calculation of a moving correlation correlation coefficient, named PRx, between mean arterial pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). The correlation coefficient was calculated from simultaneously recorded data using different frequencies. PRx was calculated from oscillations between 0.008 and 0.05Hz and the longPRx (L-PRx) was calculated from oscillations between 0.0008 and 0.016 Hz. PRx was a significant mortality predictor, whereas L-PRx was not. CPPopt for pooled data was higher for L-PRx than for PRx, with no statistical difference.

TBI is an example of a medical condition where there are still major lacks in diagnostics and outcome prediction. Here we apply comprehensive metabolic profiling of serum samples from TBI patients and controls in two independent cohorts. The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n=22), moderate (moTBI; n=14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n=108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n=28) comprised of acute orthopedic non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n=23), moTBI (n=7), mTBI (n=37) patients and controls (n=27). We show that two medium-chain fatty acids (decanoic and octanoic acids) and sugar derivatives including 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also detected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients. Based on metabolite concentrations from TBI patients at the time of hospitalization, an algorithm was developed that accurately predicted the patient outcomes (AUC=0.84 in validation cohort). Addition of the metabolites to the established clinical model (CRASH), comprising clinical and computed tomography data, significantly improved prediction of patient outcomes. The identified 'TBI metabotype' in serum, that may be indicative of disrupted blood-brain barrier, of protective physiological response and altered metabolism due to head trauma, offers a new avenue for the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers of broad spectrum of TBIs.

Predicting Outcome 12 Months after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Patients Admitted to a Neurosurgery Service.,"Hellstrom, Torgeir; Kaufmann, Tobias; Andelic, Nada; Soberg, Helene L; Sigurdardottir, Solrun; Helseth, Eirik; Andreassen, Ole A; Westlye, Lars T","OBJECTIVE: Accurate outcome prediction models for patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) are key for prognostic assessment and clinical decision-making. Using multivariate machine learning, we tested the unique and added predictive value of (1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain morphometric and volumetric characterization at 4-week postinjury and (2) demographic, preinjury, injury-related, and postinjury variables on 12-month outcomes, including global functioning level, postconcussion symptoms, and mental health in patients with MTBI., METHODS: A prospective, cohort study of patients (n = 147) aged 16-65 years with a 12-month follow-up. T1-weighted 3 T MRI data were processed in FreeSurfer, yielding accurate cortical reconstructions for surface-based analyses of cortical thickness, area, and volume, and brain segmentation for subcortical and global brain volumes. The 12-month outcome was defined as a composite score using a principal component analysis including the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended, Rivermead Postconcussion Questionnaire, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

Age-related differences in fibrinolytic parameters in patients with acute traumatic brain injury.,"Nakae, Ryuta; Yokobori, Shoji; Takayama, Yasuhiro; Kuwamoto, Kentaro; Naoe, Yasutaka; Yokota, Hiroyuki","BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy and old age have been associated with poor outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients; however, the relationships of coagulopathy and age with the acute phase of TBI remain unclear. We hypothesized that coagulation/fibrinolytic abnormalities are more severe in older patients in the acute phase of TBI and may explain, in part, their poor outcome., METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between coagulation/fibrinolytic parameters and age in the acute phase of TBI by retrospectively evaluating 274 patients with initial blood samples obtained no more than 1 hour after injury. Measurement of platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma levels of fibrinogen, and D-dimer was done in the emergency department on arrival as well as 3, 6, and 12 hours following injury. Values were compared between patients aged 16-55 years (group 1) and those aged older than 55 years (group 2) with an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS)-head of 3-5 to identify any relationship between these parameters and age., RESULTS: When groups 1 and 2 were matched for AIS-head, plasma levels of D-dimer in group 2 were significantly higher than those in group 1 from hospital admission to 12 hours after injury. The Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 3 months post-injury of group 2 with AIS 4 and 5 were significantly lower than those of group 1 (both P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinolytic abnormalities are more severe in older acute-phase TBI patients, which may be a factor associated with their poor prognosis.",2017,/,Surgical neurology international,8,101535836,214,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/sni.sni_56_17,28966820,#6489,Nakae 2017,,yes
EEG slow waves in traumatic brain injury: Convergent findings in mouse and man.,"Modarres, Mo H; Kuzma, Nicholas N; Kretzmer, Tracy; Pack, Allan I; Lim, Miranda M","Objective: Evidence from previous studies suggests that greater sleep pressure, in the form of EEG-based slow waves, accumulates in specific brain regions that are more active during prior waking experience. We sought to quantify the number and coherence of EEG slow waves in subjects with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)., Methods: We developed a method to automatically detect individual slow waves in each EEG channel, and validated this method using simulated EEG data. We then used this method to quantify EEG-based slow waves during sleep and wake states in both mouse and human subjects with mTBI. A modified coherence index that accounts for information from multiple channels was calculated as a measure of slow wave synchrony., Results: Brain-injured mice showed significantly higher theta:alpha amplitude ratios and significantly more slow waves during spontaneous wakefulness and during prolonged sleep deprivation, compared to sham-injured control mice. Human subjects with mTBI showed significantly higher theta:beta amplitude ratios and significantly more EEG slow waves while awake compared to age-matched control subjects. We then quantified the global coherence index of slow waves across several EEG channels in human subjects. Individuals with mTBI showed significantly less EEG global coherence compared to control subjects while awake, but not during sleep. EEG global coherence was significantly correlated with severity of post-concussive symptoms (as assessed by the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory scale)., Conclusion and implications: Taken together, our data from both mouse and human studies suggest that EEG slow wave quantity and the global coherence index of slow waves may represent a sensitive marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of mTBI and post-concussive symptoms.",2017,/,Neurobiology of sleep and circadian rhythms,2,101690253,59-70,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbscr.2016.06.001,31236495,#6487,Modarres 2017,,yes
Luteinizing Hormone and Testosterone Levels during Acute Phase of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Prognostic Implications for Adult Male Patients.,"Hohl, Alexandre; Zanela, Fernando Areas; Ghisi, Gabriela; Ronsoni, Marcelo Fernando; Diaz, Alexandre Paim; Schwarzbold, Marcelo Liborio; Dafre, Alcir Luiz; Reddi, Benjamin; Lin, Katia; Pizzol, Felipe Dal; Walz, Roger","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a worldwide core public health problem affecting mostly young male subjects. An alarming increase in incidence has turned TBI into a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young adults as well as a tremendous resource burden on the health and welfare sector. Hormone dysfunction is highly prevalent during the acute phase of severe TBI. In particular, investigation of the luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels during the acute phase of severe TBI in male has identified a high incidence of low testosterone levels in male patients (36.5-100%) but the prognostic significance of which remains controversial. Two independent studies showed that normal or elevated levels of LH levels earlier during hospitalization are significantly associated with higher mortality/morbidity. The association between LH levels and prognosis was independent of other predictive variables such as neuroimaging, admission Glasgow coma scale, and pupillary reaction. The possible mechanisms underlying this association and further research directions in this field are discussed. Overall, current data suggest that LH levels during the acute phase of TBI might contribute to accurate prognostication and further prospective multicentric studies are required to develop more sophisticated predictive models incorporating biomarkers such as LH in the quest for accurate outcome prediction following TBI.

In this study, 96 adult patients with TBI (enrolled from September 2015 to December 2016) were divided into a mild/moderate TBI group (36 males and 25 females, aged 38 +/- 13 years) and severe TBI group (22 males and 13 females, aged 38 +/- 11 years) according to Glasgow Coma Scale scores. In addition, 25 healthy individuals were selected as controls (15 males and 10 females, aged 39 +/- 13 years). Radioimmunoassay was used to detect serum levels of CGRP and endothelin-1 at admission and at 12, 24, 48, 72 hours, and 7 days after admission. CGRP levels were remarkably lower, but endothelin-1 levels were obviously higher in the severe TBI group compared with mild/moderate TBI and control groups. Levels of CGRP were remarkably lower, but endothelin-1 levels were obviously higher in deceased patients compared with patients who survived. Survival analysis and logistic regression showed that both CGRP and endothelin-1 levels were associated with patient mortality, with each serving as an independent risk factor for 6-month mortality of severe TBI patients. Moreover, TBI patients with lower serum CGRP levels had a higher risk of death.

As mTBI gains recognition as a serious public health epidemic, there is need to identify risk factors, diagnostic tools, and imaging biomarkers to help guide diagnosis and management. Methods: One hundred and eleven patients (15-50 years old) were enrolled acutely after mTBI and followed with up to four standardized serial assessments over 3 months. Each encounter included a clinical exam, neuropsychological assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Chi-square and linear mixed models were used to assess changes over time and determine potential biomarkers of mTBI severity and outcome. Results: The symptoms most frequently endorsed after mTBI were headache (91%), not feeling right (89%), fatigue (86%), and feeling slowed down (84%). Of the 104 mTBI patients with a processed MRI scan, 28 (27%) subjects had white matter changes which were deemed unrelated to age, and 26 of these findings were deemed unrelated to acute trauma. Of the neuropsychological assessments tested, 5- and 6-Digit Backward Recall, the modified Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and Immediate 5-Word Recall significantly improved longitudinally in mTBI subjects and differentiated between mTBI subjects and controls. Female sex was found to increase symptom severity scores (SSS) at every time point. Age >= 25 years was correlated with increased SSS. Subjects aged >= 25 also did not improve longitudinally on 5-Digit Backward Recall, Immediate 5-Word Recall, or Single-Leg Stance of the BESS, whereas subjects < 25 years improved significantly. Patients who reported personal history of depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorder had higher SSS at each time point. Conclusions: The results of this study show that 5- and 6-Digit Backward Recall, the modified BESS, and Immediate 5-Word Recall should be considered useful in demonstrating cognitive and vestibular improvement during the mTBI recovery process.

This study sought to: (1) describe changes in the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) score in survivors of moderate to severe TBI, (2) examine longitudinal GOSE trajectories up to 10 years after injury, and (3) investigate predictors of these trajectories based on socio-demographic and injury characteristics. Methods: Socio-demographic and injury characteristics of 97 TBI survivors aged 16-55 years were recorded at baseline. GOSE was used as a measure of TBI-related global outcome and assessed at 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year follow-ups. Hierarchical linear models were used to examine global outcomes over time and whether those outcomes could be predicted by: time, time*time, sex, age, partner relationship status, education, employment pre-injury, occupation, cause of injury, acute Glasgow Coma Scale score, length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), CT findings, and Injury Severity Score (ISS), as well as the interactions between each of the significant predictors and time*time. Results: Between 5- and 10-year follow-ups, 37% had deteriorated, 7% had improved, and 56% showed no change in global outcome. Better GOSE trajectories were predicted by male gender (p = 0.013), younger age (p = 0.012), employment at admission (p = 0.012), white collar occupation (p = 0.014), and shorter PTA length (p = 0.001). The time*time*occupation type interaction effect (p = 0.001) identified different trajectory slopes between survivors in white and blue collar occupations. The time*time*PTA interaction effect (p = 0.023) identified a more marked increase and subsequent decrease in functional level among survivors with longer PTA duration. Conclusion:  A larger proportion of survivors experienced deterioration in GOSE scores over time, supporting the concept of TBI as a chronic health condition. Younger age, pre-injury employment, and shorter PTA duration are important prognostic factors for better long-term global outcomes, supporting the existing literature, whereas male gender and white collar occupation are vaguer as prognostic factors. This information suggests that more intensive and tailored rehabilitation programs may be required to counteract a negative global outcome development in survivors with predicted worse outcome and to meet their long-term changing needs.",2019,/,Frontiers in neurology,10,101546899,219,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.00219,30923511,#6478,Forslund 2019,,yes

The aim of this study was to evaluate the early changes in serum sex hormone levels after severe TBI (sTBI) and the use of these hormones to predict recovery from unconsciousness with regard to sex. Methods: We performed a retrospective study including patients with sTBI. A statistical of analysis of serum sex hormone levels and recovery of consciousness at 6 months was made to identify the effective prognostic indicators. Results: Fifty-five male patients gained recovery of consciousness, and 37 did not. Of the female patients, 22 out of 32 patients regained consciousness. Male patients (n = 92) with sTBI, compared with healthy subjects (n = 60), had significantly lower levels of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and progesterone and higher levels of prolactin. Female patients (n = 32) with sTBI, compared with controls (n = 60), had significantly lower levels of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone and significantly higher levels of FSH and prolactin. Testosterone significantly predicted consciousness recovery in male patients. Normal or elevated testosterone levels in the serum were associated with a reduced risk of the unconscious state in male patients with sTBI. For women patients with sTBI, sex hormone levels did not contribute to the prediction of consciousness recovery. Conclusion:  These findings indicate that TBI differentially affects the levels of sex-steroid hormones in men and women patients.

Genetic Variation in the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter: Preliminary Associations With Cognitive Outcomes After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Markos, Steven M; Failla, Michelle D; Ritter, Anne C; Dixon, C Edward; Conley, Yvette P; Ricker, Joseph H; Arenth, Patricia M; Juengst, Shannon B; Wagner, Amy K","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently results in impaired cognition, a function that can be modulated by monoaminergic signaling. Genetic variation among monoaminergic genes may affect post-TBI cognitive performance. The vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) gene may be a novel source of genetic variation important for cognitive outcomes post-TBI given VMAT2's role in monoaminergic neurotransmission., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between VMAT2 variability and cognitive outcomes post-TBI., METHODS: We evaluated 136 white adults with severe TBI for variation in VMAT2 using a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) approach (rs363223, rs363226, rs363251, and rs363341). We show genetic variation interacts with assessed cognitive impairment (cognitive composite [Comp-Cog] T-scores) to influence functional cognition (functional independence measure cognitive [FIM-Cog] subscale] 6 and 12 months postinjury., RESULTS: Multivariate analyses at 6 months postinjury showed rs363226 genotype was associated with Comp-Cog (P = .040) and interacted with Comp-Cog to influence functional cognition (P < .001). G-homozygotes had the largest cognitive impairment, and their cognitive impairment had the greatest adverse effect on functional cognition., DISCUSSION: We provide the first evidence that genetic variation within VMAT2 is associated with cognitive outcomes after TBI.

Use of Transcranial Doppler in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injuries.,"Ziegler, Daniel; Cravens, George; Poche, Gerard; Gandhi, Raj; Tellez, Mark","Severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are associated with a high rate of mortality and disability. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography permits a noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of TCD in patients with severe TBI. TCD was performed, from April 2008 to April 2013, on 255 patients with severe TBI, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of <=8 on admission. TCD was performed on hospital days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Hypoperfusion was defined by having two out of three of the following: 1) mean velocity (Vm) of the middle cerebral artery <35 cm/sec, 2) diastolic velocity (Vd) of the middle cerebral artery <20 cm/sec, or 3) pulsatility index (PI) of >1.4. Vasospasm was defined by the following: Vm of the middle cerebral artery >120 cm/sec and/or a Lindegaard index (LI) >3. One hundred fourteen (45%) had normal measurements. Of these, 92 (80.7%) had a good outcome, 6 (5.3%) had moderate disability, and 16 (14%) died, 4 from brain death.

Selected variables identified during univariate analysis (p < 0.1) were then subjected to multivariate analysis logistic regression model., RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that in-hospital mortality was statistically significantly associated with male sex (p = 0.040), ISS (p = 0.005) and mydriasis (p = 0.012). For predicting mortality, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated: for ISS 0.76 (95 % confidence interval, CI; 0.63-0.90; p < 0.001) and for initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 0.64 (95 % CI, 0.49-0.80, p = 0.079). In the multivariate analysis, ISS (odds ratio, OR; 1.19, 95 % CI, 1.06-1.35; p = 0.004) and mydriasis (OR, 5.73; 95 % CI, 1.06-30.88; p = 0.042) were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The AUC for the regression model was 0.83 (95 % CI, 0.71-0.94; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In prehospital intubated patients with isolated severe TBI only ISS and mydriasis were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.",2017,/,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,129,04-Mar,110-114,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00508-016-0974-0,26968575,#6449,Strnad 2017,,yes
"Increases of Plasma Levels of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Tau, and Amyloid beta up to 90 Days after Traumatic Brain Injury.","Bogoslovsky, Tanya; Wilson, David; Chen, Yao; Hanlon, David; Gill, Jessica; Jeromin, Andreas; Song, Linan; Moore, Carol; Gong, Yunhua; Kenney, Kimbra; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon","Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microtubule-associated protein tau, and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) have been proposed as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Single molecule array (Simoa) is a novel technology that employs highly sensitive immunoassays for accurate measurements of candidate biomarkers found at low concentration in biological fluids. Our objective was to trace the trajectory of tau, GFAP, and Abeta42 levels in plasma from the acute through subacute stages after TBI, compared with controls. Samples from 34 TBI subjects enrolled in the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT) were studied. Injury severity was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and admission CT. Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) was assessed 6 months after injury. Plasma was collected within 24 h (Day 0), and 30 and 90 days after the TBI. Plasma collected from 69 healthy volunteers was used for comparison. At every time point, increases were noted in plasma GFAP (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons), tau (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.0044, at Days 0, 30, and 90, respectively), and Abeta42 (p < 0.001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.0203, respectively) in TBI cases compared with controls. The levels were maximal at Day 0 for GFAP and tau and at Day 30 for Abeta42. Area under curve (AUC) analyses for Day 0 GFAP and tau were excellent for discrimination of complicated mild TBI (cmTBI) from controls (0.936 and 0.901, correspondingly). Discriminant component analysis (DCA) for all three biomarkers at Days 0 and 30 differentiated controls from cmTBI (91.1% and 89.7% correctly classified, at each time point). Duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) correlated weakly with tau levels at 30 days (Spearman's r = 0.40; 95% CI 0.0003-0.60, p = 0.044). The Marshall CT Grade on admission correlated weakly with Day 30 tau levels (Spearman's r = 0.41; 95% CI 0.04-0.68, p = 0.027). Day 30 Abeta42 correlated with GOSE (standardized beta -0.486, p = 0.042). GFAP, tau and Abeta42 were increased up to 90 days after TBI compared with controls. Total tau levels correlated with clinical and radiological variables of TBI severity. Plasma Abeta42 correlated with clinical outcome. Combination of all three biomarkers at Days 0 and 30 can be used to differentiate controls from cmTBI populations, and may be useful as biomarkers of TBI in both acute and subacute phases.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,1,66-73,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2015.4333,27312416,#6434,Bogoslovsky 2017,,yes
Isolated traumatic brain injury in patients with cirrhosis: do different treatment paradigms result in increased mortality?.,"Langness, Simone; Costantini, Todd W; Smith, Alan; Bansal, Vishal; Coimbra, Raul","BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality in trauma, yet its effects on outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are unclear. We hypothesized that cirrhosis adversely effects mortality and increases complications after TBI., METHODS: Cirrhotic patients with isolated TBI were matched with noncirrhotic TBI patients in a 3:1 ratio based on age, sex, injury mechanism, and injury severity score at our academic, level 1 trauma center., RESULTS: Of the 8,748 patients with isolated TBI, 65 patients had concurrent cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients had increased mortality compared with matched controls (31% vs 17%, P = .03) and were less likely to undergo emergent neurosurgical operation (12% vs 25%, P = .03). There was no difference in admission Glasgow Coma Score, type of intracranial hemorrhage, length of stay, or complications between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhotic patients have increased mortality after TBI and were less likely to undergo operative intervention.

CT follow-up and clinical outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients.,"Belina, Stanko; Kovacic, Sanja","Determining a patient's prognosis after severe traumatic brain injury remains difficult and complex. The purpose of the present study was following up patients with severe traumatic brain injury by correlating their clinical outcome and sequential computer tomography (CT) findings. We investigated 51 patients who survived the first year following an accident. All patients underwent successive CT examinations within a maximum period of 2 years. The patients' outcomes depended on the underlying brain damage and are presented by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Based on the investigated data we concluded that the worst outcomes were experienced by patients with initial massive cerebral edema, extensive subdural hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage, followed by stroke as subacute CT finding and cerebral atrophy as chronic finding visible at follow-up CT scans. The majority of lesions identified by CT scan were found in the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the etiological spectrum, injury characteristics and treatment outcome of head injury patients at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in North-western Tanzania. Data were collected using a pre-tested, coded questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS programme. A total of 260 head injury patients (mean age=26.84 years) were studied. Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 1.5:1. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) were the most common cause of injury accounting for 49.2% of patients. Scalp injuries, cerebral concussion and skull fractures were the most common type of head injuries. Fifty-six (21.5%) patients had associated injuries of which musculoskeletal region (36.1%) was commonly affected. Most of patients (66.1%) sustained mild head injury. The majority of patients (75.8%) were treated conservatively and only 24.2% of patients needed surgical interventions. Most of patients (85.4%) had good recovery. The mean hospital stay (LOS) was 24.56 days and the mortality rate was 11.2%. Patients who had RTAs, penetrating head injuries, associated long bone fractures and those who were treated surgically were found to have significantly longer LOS (P< 0.001). Mortality was found to be significantly associated with extreme of age, presence of pre-morbid illness and associated injuries, admission Glasgow Coma Score < 9, systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg, injury severity core > or =16, longer duration of loss of consciousness, the need for intensive care unit admission and finding of space occupying lesion on computed tomography scan (P < 0.001).

The purpose of this study is to delineate the characteristics and importance of supratentorial deep white matter hemorrhages detected by SWI in cases of traumatic brain damage., METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive cases with severe traumatic head injury were included in the current study. MRI examinations were made within 1 month after injury. We evaluated the degree and distribution of the supratentorial hemorrhages on SWI retrospectively. We classified the degree of bleeding into four grades: ""small hemorrhage,"" ""single bead-like hemorrhage,"" ""convergent-type hemorrhage,"" and ""massive hemorrhage."" We then correlated the degree and distribution of the hemorrhage to clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image of lobes with ""convergent-type hemorrhage."", RESULTS: Existence of ""massive hemorrhage"" correlated with a poor outcome, that is, worse than ""severely disabled"" on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The number of lobes affected by ""convergent-type hemorrhage"" also correlated with poor outcome. There were 45 lobes with ""convergent-type hemorrhage"" and 27 of them showed increased diffusivity on ADC images., CONCLUSION: Supratentorial massive hemorrhages and supratentorial convergent-type multiple hemorrhages were associated with poor prognosis after traumatic brain injury.

Prospective independent validation of IMPACT modeling as a prognostic tool in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Panczykowski, David M; Puccio, Ava M; Scruggs, Bobby J; Bauer, Joshua S; Hricik, Allison J; Beers, Sue R; Okonkwo, David O","Clinical trials in traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been fraught with failure due in part to heterogeneity in pathology and insensitive outcome measurements. The International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model has been purposed as a means of risk adjustment and outcome prediction for use in trial design and analysis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the IMPACT model in predicting 6-month functional outcome and mortality using prospectively collected data at a large, Level 1 neurotrauma center. This population-based cohort study included all TBI patients >=14 years of age admitted with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of <=8 (severe TBI) to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between July 1994 and May 2009. Clinical data were prospectively collected and linked to 6-month functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]) and mortality. The discriminatory power and calibration of the three iterations of the IMPACT model (core, extended, and lab) were assessed using multiple regression analyses and indicated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A sample of 587 patients was available for analysis; the mean age was 37.8+/-17 years. The median 6-month GOS was 3 (IQR 3); 6-month mortality was 41%. The prognostic models were composed of age, motor score, and pupillary reactivity (core model), Marshall grade on head CT and secondary insults (extended), and laboratory values (lab); all of these displayed good prediction ability for unfavorable outcome and mortality (unfavorable outcome AUC=0.76, 0.79, 0.76; mortality AUC=0.78, 0.83, 0.83, respectively).

Redefining hypotension in traumatic brain injury.,"Berry, Cherisse; Ley, Eric J; Bukur, Marko; Malinoski, Darren; Margulies, Daniel R; Mirocha, James; Salim, Ali","BACKGROUND: Systemic hypotension is a well documented predictor of increased mortality following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hypotension is traditionally defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP)<90 mmHg. Recent evidence defines hypotension by a higher SBP in injured (non-TBI) trauma patients. We hypothesize that hypotension threshold requires a higher SBP in isolated moderate to severe TBI., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective database review of all adults (>= 15 years) with isolated moderate to severe TBI (head abbreviated injury score (AIS)>= 3, all other AIS <= 3), admitted from five Level I and eight Level II trauma centres (Los Angeles County), between 1998 and 2005. Several fit statistic analyses were performed for each admission SBP from 60 to 180 mmHg to identify the model that most accurately defined hypotension for three age groups: 15-49 years, 50-69 years, and >= 70 years. The main outcome variable was mortality, and the optimal definition of hypotension for each group was determined from the best fit model. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were then calculated to determine increased odds in mortality for the defined optimal SBP within each age group., RESULTS: A total of 15,733 patients were analysed. The optimal threshold of hypotension according to the best fit model was SBP of 110 mmHg for patients 15-49 years (AOR 1.98, CI 1.65-2.39, p<0.0001), 100 mmHg for patients 50-69 years (AOR 2.20, CI 1.46-3.31, p=0.0002), and 110 mmHg for patients >= 70 years (AOR 1.92, CI 1.35-2.74, p=0.0003)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with isolated moderate to severe TBI should be considered hypotensive for SBP<110 mmHg.

Using our TBI database, we identified the thresholds for PRx and other monitored parameters that maximize the statistical difference between death/survival and favorable/unfavorable outcomes. We also investigated how these thresholds depend on clinical factors such as age, gender and initial GCS., METHODS: A total of 459 patients from our database were eligible. Tables of 2 x 2 format were created grouping patients according to survival/death or favorable/unfavorable outcomes and varying thresholds for PRx, ICP and CPP. Pearson's chi square was calculated, and the thresholds returning the highest score were assumed to have the best discriminative value. The same procedure was repeated after division according to clinical factors., RESULTS: In all patients, we found that PRx had different thresholds for survival (0.25) and for favorable outcome (0.05). Thresholds of 70 mmHg for CPP and 22 mmHg for ICP were identified for both survival and favorable outcomes. The ICP threshold for favorable outcome was lower (18 mmHg) in females and patients older than 55 years. In logistic regression models, independent variables associating with mortality and unfavorable outcome were age, GCS, ICP and PRx., CONCLUSION: The prognostic role of PRx is confirmed but with a lower threshold of 0.05 for favorable outcome than for survival (0.25).

Quantitative CT improves outcome prediction in acute traumatic brain injury.,"Yuh, Esther L; Cooper, Shelly R; Ferguson, Adam R; Manley, Geoffrey T","The admission noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan has been demonstrated to be one of several key early clinical and imaging features in the challenging problem of prediction of long-term outcome after acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we employ two novel approaches to the problem of imaging classification and outcome prediction in acute TBI. First, we employ the novel technique of quantitative CT (qCT) image analysis to provide more objective, reproducible measures of the abnormal features of the admission head CT in acute TBI. We show that the incorporation of quantitative, rather than qualitative, CT features results in a significant improvement in prediction of the 6-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score over a wide spectrum of injury severity. Second, we employ principal components analysis (PCA) to demonstrate the interdependence of certain predictive variables. Relatively few prior studies of outcome prediction in acute TBI have used a multivariate approach that explicitly takes into account the potential covariance among clinical and CT predictive variables. We demonstrate that several predictors, including midline shift, cistern effacement, subdural hematoma volume, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score are related to one another. Rather than being independent features, their importance may be related to their status as surrogate measures of a more fundamental underlying clinical feature, such as the severity of intracranial mass effect. We believe that objective computational tools and data-driven analytical methods hold great promise for neurotrauma research, and may ultimately have a role in image analysis for clinical care.",2012,/,Journal of neurotrauma,29,5,735-46,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.2008,21970562,#8982,Yuh 2012,,yes
When a minor head injury results in enduring symptoms: a prospective investigation of risk factors for postconcussional syndrome after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Hou, Ruihua; Moss-Morris, Rona; Peveler, Robert; Mogg, Karin; Bradley, Brendan P; Belli, Antonio","OBJECTIVE: A significant proportion (15-30%) of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) are at risk of developing postconcussional syndrome (PCS). The aim of this study was to investigate the contributions of cognitive, emotional, behavioural and social factors to the development of PCS and identify early predictors., METHODS: A prospective cohort design was employed. 126 MTBI patients completed baseline questionnaire assessments within 2 weeks of the injury and 107 completed follow-up questionnaire assessments at 3 and 6 months. A series of self-report measures were used to assess cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses to MTBI. The primary outcome was the ICD-10 diagnosis for PCS. Demographic and clinical characteristic variables were compared between PCS cases and non-cases using independent sample t tests and chi(2) tests. Individual and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to detect predictors of PCS., RESULTS: Of 107 MTBI patients, 24 (22%) met the criteria for PCS at 3 months and 22 (21%) at 6 months. Individual logistic regression analysis indicated that negative MTBI perceptions, stress, anxiety, depression and all-or-nothing behaviour were associated with the risk of PCS. Multivariate analysis revealed that all-or-nothing behaviour was the key predictor for the onset of PCS at 3 months while negative MTBI perceptions predicted PCS at 6 months., CONCLUSIONS: The study provides good support for the proposed cognitive behavioural model. Patients' perceptions of their head injury and their behavioural responses play important roles in the development of PCS, indicating that cognitive and behavioural factors may be potential targets for early preventive interventions.",2012,/,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",83,2,217-23,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2011-300767,22028384,#8976,Hou 2012,,yes
Glucose variability negatively impacts long-term functional outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Matsushima, Kazuhide; Peng, Monica; Velasco, Carlos; Schaefer, Eric; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Frankel, Heidi","PURPOSE: Significant glycemic excursions (so-called glucose variability) affect the outcome of generic critically ill patients but has not been well studied in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of glucose variability on long-term functional outcome of patients with TBI., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A noncomputerized tight glucose control protocol was used in our intensivist model surgical intensive care unit. The relationship between the glucose variability and long-term (a median of 6 months after injury) functional outcome defined by extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) was analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models. Glucose variability was defined by SD and percentage of excursion (POE) from the preset range glucose level., RESULTS: A total of 109 patients with TBI under tight glucose control had long-term GOSE evaluated. In univariable analysis, there was a significant association between lower GOSE score and higher mean glucose, higher SD, POE more than 60, POE 80 to 150, and single episode of glucose less than 60 mg/dL but not POE 80 to 110. After adjusting for possible confounding variables in multivariable ordinal logistic regression models, higher SD, POE more than 60, POE 80 to 150, and single episode of glucose less than 60 mg/dL were significantly associated with lower GOSE score., CONCLUSIONS: Glucose variability was significantly associated with poorer long-term functional outcome in patients with TBI as measured by the GOSE score. Well-designed protocols to minimize glucose variability may be key in improving long-term functional outcome. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Elevated intracranial pressure, low cerebral perfusion pressure, and impaired brain metabolism correlate with fatal outcome after severe brain injury.","Hejcl, A; Bolcha, M; Prochazka, J; Huskova, E; Sames, M","BACKGROUND: New brain tissue monitoring techniques (tissue oxymetry, microdialysis) provide direct information about the state of brain oxygenation and brain metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite this information being limited to a small region of the brain surrounding the probes, it could be associated with such global parameters as the clinical outcome., OBJECTIVE: To study the predictive value of monitoring brain oxygenation and metabolism on clinical outcome in patients in the acute phase of severe TBI., METHODS: An observational study of 20 patients with a severe TBI was undertaken, utilizing intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), brain tissue oxygenation, and brain metabolism monitoring. We correlated the clinical outcome of the patients with the following parameters: ICP, CPP, brain tissue oxymetry (PbtO2), glucose and glycerol levels, and the lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio. Further, we analyzed the relationship between ICP, CPP, PbtO2, and the metabolism parameters., RESULTS: We found a correlation of the mean ICP values (8.73 +/- 1.18 in group A vs. 26.32 +/- 5.01 mmHg in group B, p < 0.005), the mean CPP values (84.82 +/- 2.02 in group A vs. 66.62 +/- 4.64 mmHg, p < 0.005), the LP ratio (37.36 +/- 3.44 vs. 199 +/- 87.97, p < 0.05), and glycerol levels (62.07 +/- 12.14 vs. 215 +/- 46.52 mumol/l, p < 0.05) with the clinical outcome. High ICP correlated with both a high LP ratio (Spearman R = 0.61, p < 0.05), and elevated glycerol concentrations (Spearman R = 0.48, p < 0.05). A low CPP correlated with a high LP ratio (Spearman R = -0.57, p < 0.05), while a low PbtO2 correlated with a high LP ratio (Spearman R = -0.49, p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: High ICP, low CPP, an elevated mean LP ratio, and high glycerol concentrations in the acute phase predict fatal outcome 6 months after TBI. Further, high ICP, low CPP, and low PbtO2 correlate with impaired brain metabolism.

Prognostic value of copeptin: one-year outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Yu, Guo-Feng; Huang, Qiang; Dai, Wei-Min; Jie, Yuan-Qing; Fan, Xiao-Feng; Wu, An; Lv, Yao; Li, Yun-Ping; Yan, Xin-Jiang","High plasma copeptin level has been associated with one-month mortality after traumatic brain injury. However, not much is known regarding its relation with long-term outcome. Thus, we investigated the ability of copeptin to predict 1-year outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. One hundred and six healthy controls and 106 patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were included. Plasma samples were obtained on admission. Its concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Forty-eight patients (45.3%) suffered from unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) and 31 patients (29.2%) died in 1 year after traumatic brain injury. Upon admission, plasma copeptin level in patients was substantially higher than that in healthy controls. A forward stepwise logistic regression selected plasma copeptin level as an independent predictor for 1-year unfavorable outcome and mortality of patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed plasma copeptin level predicted 1-year unfavorable outcome and mortality obviously. The predictive value of the copeptin concentration was thus similar to that of Glasgow Coma Scale score for the prediction of unfavorable outcome and mortality after 1 year. In a combined logistic-regression model, copeptin improved the area under curve of Glasgow Coma Scale score for the prediction of unfavorable outcome and mortality after 1 year, but the differences were not significant. Thus, copeptin level is a useful, complementary tool to predict functional outcome and mortality 1 year after traumatic brain injury. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Prostacyclin treatment and clinical outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients managed with an ICP-targeted therapy: a prospective study.,"Olivecrona, Magnus; Rodling-Wahlstrom, Marie; Naredi, Silvana; Koskinen, Lars-Owe D","OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess clinical outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) managed according to an ICP-targeted programme as well as additional treatment with prostacyclin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were GCS <=8, age 15-70 years, first recorded cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > 10 mm Hg. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breastfeeding or penetrating brain injury. The patients were treated using the same ICP-guided protocol, with one group randomized to receive prostacyclin in a low dose (0.5 ng kg(-1 )min(-1)). The clinical outcome was prospectively assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months using structured interviews., RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included, mean age 35.5 years, median GCS 6 (3-8), 69% were multi-traumatized. Mortality at 3 months was 12.5%. Median Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at all follow-up points was 4. Favourable outcome (GOS 4-5) at 3 months was 52%, at 24 months 64%. Favourable outcome increased over time. There was a statistically significant association between GOS, GCS at admission and age. Higher ICP(max) was associated with worse outcome., CONCLUSION: With this treatment protocol, a low number of deaths and a high number of favourable outcomes in sTBI were observed. Prostacyclin in this low dose does not seem to improve the outcome. ICP(max) is a positive predictor of worse outcome.

Predicting 14-day mortality after severe traumatic brain injury: application of the IMPACT models in the brain trauma foundation TBI-trac R New York State database.,"Roozenbeek, Bob; Chiu, Ya-Lin; Lingsma, Hester F; Gerber, Linda M; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Ghajar, Jamshid; Maas, Andrew I R","Prognostic models for outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important instruments in both clinical practice and research. To remain current a continuous process of model validation is necessary. We aimed to investigate the performance of the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic models in predicting mortality in a contemporary New York State TBI registry developed and maintained by the Brain Trauma Foundation. The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) TBI-trac R database contains data on 3125 patients who sustained severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score <= 8) in New York State between 2000 and 2009. The outcome measure was 14-day mortality. To predict 14-day mortality with admission data, we adapted the IMPACT Core and Extended models. Performance of the models was assessed by determining calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), and discrimination (separation of those patients who die from those who survive). Calibration was explored graphically with calibration plots. Discrimination was expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). A total of 2513 out of 3125 patients in the BTF database met the inclusion criteria. The 14-day mortality rate was 23%. The models showed excellent calibration. Mean predicted probabilities were 20% for the Core model and 24% for the Extended model. Both models showed good discrimination with AUCs of 0.79 (Core) and 0.83 (Extended).

Are routine repeat imaging and intensive care unit admission necessary in mild traumatic brain injury?.,"Washington, Chad W; Grubb, Robert L Jr","OBJECT: More than 1.5 million Americans suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. Seventy-five percent of these patients have a mild TBI, with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Score 13-15. At the authors' institution, the usual practice has been to admit those patients with an associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) to an ICU and to obtain repeat head CT scans 12-24 hours after admission. The purpose of this study was to determine if there exists a subpopulation of mild TBI patients with an abnormal head CT scan that requires neither repeat brain imaging nor admission to an ICU. This group of patients was further classified based on initial clinical factors and imaging characteristics., METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to a Level I trauma center from January 2007 through December 2008 was performed using the hospital Trauma Registry Database, medical records, and imaging data. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) an admission GCS score >= 13; 2) an isolated head injury with no other injury requiring ICU admission; 3) an initial head CT scan positive for ICH; and 4) an initial management plan that was nonoperative. Collected data included age, etiology, initial GCS score, time of injury, duration of ICU stay, duration of hospital stay, and anticoagulation status. Primary outcomes measured were the occurrence of neurological or medical decline and the need for neurosurgical intervention. Imaging data were analyzed and classified based on the predominant blood distribution found on admission imaging. Data were further categorized based on the Marshall CT classification, Rotterdam score, and volume of intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). Progression was defined as an increase in the Marshall classification, an increase in the Rotterdam score, or a 30% increase in IPH volume., RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-one of 1101 reviewed cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Only 4 patients (1%) suffered a neurological decline and 4 (1%) required nonemergent neurosurgical intervention. There was a medical decline in 18 of the patients (6%) as a result of a combination of events such as respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, and sepsis. Both patient age and the transfusion of blood products were significant predictors of medical decline. Overall patient mortality was 1%. Based on imaging data, the rate of injury progression was 6%. The only type of ICH found to have a significant rate of progression (53%) was a subfrontal/temporal intraparenchymal contusion. Other variables found to be significant predictors of progression on head CT scans were the use of anticoagulation, an age over 65 years, and a volume of ICH > 10 ml., CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with mild TBI have a good outcome without the necessity of neurosurgical intervention. Mild TBI patients with a convexity SAH, small convexity contusion, small IPH (<= 10 ml), and/or small subdural hematoma do not require admission to an ICU or repeat imaging in the absence of a neurological decline.",2012,/,Journal of neurosurgery,116,3,549-57,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2011.11.JNS111092,22196096,#8937,Washington 2012,,yes
Traumatic brain injury in an aging population.,"Stocchetti, Nino; Paterno, Rosalia; Citerio, Giuseppe; Beretta, Luigi; Colombo, Angelo","The epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is changing in several Western countries, with an increasing proportion of elderly TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We describe a series of 1366 adult patients admitted to three neuro-ICUs in which 44% of cases were 50 years of age or older. The health status before trauma (rated using the APACHE score) was worse in older patients. In all 604 patients had emergency removal of intracranial masses, with extradural hematomas more frequent in young cases and subdural hematomas more frequent in older patients. Outcomes were classified according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 6 months post-trauma, as favorable (GOS score 4-5), or unfavorable (GOS score 1-3). Favorable outcomes were achieved by 50% of patients, but the proportions of unfavorable outcomes rose with age. Mortality was the main cause of unfavorable outcomes 6 months after injury in older patients. Logistic regression analysis indicates that several parameters independently contributed to outcome, including the motor component of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupils, CT findings, and early hypotension. Additionally, the odds ratios were very high for age and health status before TBI. Patients admitted to the ICU are increasingly older, have co-morbidities, and have specific types of intracranial lesions. Early rescue, surgical treatment, and intensive care of these patients may produce excellent results up to the age of 59 years, with favorable outcomes still possible for 39% of cases aged 60-69 years, without an excessive burden of severely disabled patients.",2012,/,Journal of neurotrauma,29,6,1119-25,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.1995,22220762,#8931,Stocchetti 2012,,yes
Position of probe determines prognostic information of brain tissue PO2 in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Ponce, Lucido L; Pillai, Shibu; Cruz, Jovany; Li, Xiaoqi; Julia, H; Gopinath, Shankar; Robertson, Claudia S","BACKGROUND: Monitoring brain tissue PO2 (PbtO2) is part of multimodality monitoring of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, PbtO2 measurement is a sampling of only a small area of tissue surrounding the sensor tip., OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of catheter location on the relationship between PbtO2 and neurological outcome., METHODS: A total of 405 patients who had PbtO2 monitoring as part of standard management of severe traumatic brain injury were studied. The relationships between probe location and resulting PbtO2 and outcome were examined., RESULTS: When the probe was located in normal brain, PbtO2 averaged 30.8 +/- 18.2 compared with 25.6 +/- 14.8 mm Hg when placed in abnormal brain (P < .001). Factors related to neurological outcome in the best-fit logistic regression model were age, PbtO2 probe position, postresuscitation motor Glasgow Coma Scale score, and PbtO2 trend pattern. Although average PbtO2 was significantly related to outcome in univariate analyses, it was not significant in the final logistic model. However, the interaction between PbtO2 and probe position was statistically significant. When the PbtO2 probe was placed in abnormal brain, the average PbtO2 was higher in those with a favorable outcome, 28.8 +/- 12.0 mm Hg, compared with those with an unfavorable outcome, 19.5 +/- 13.7 mm Hg (P = .01).

The atrial natriuretic peptide does not serve osmoregulation but predicts outcome following brain injury.,"Kleindienst, Andrea; Brabant, Georg; Morgenthaler, Nils G; Emtmann, Irene; Scheufler, Nadine; Buchfelder, Michael","Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plays an important role in body fluid homeostasis. ANP has been established as a marker of cardiac dysfunction and may play a role in brain edema development after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In order to identify its specific assignment following TBI, we related clinical data and treatment variables in 63 patients to longitudinal midregional (MR) proatrail natriuretic peptide (ANP) measurements. ANP correlated significantly to age (p < 0.0001) and vasopressin release (p < 0.001). Following TBI, ANP was increased initially and on day 3 (cut-off 100 pg/L) in 22% of the patients, in 31% on day 7, and was normalized at follow-up examination. The group comparison revealed that ANP levels did not significantly differ with regard to injury severity, but that high ANP levels predicted a worse Glasgow Outcome Score at 6 months (p < 0.05). While the initially intact osmoregulation - a correlation of urine volume and high serum sodium (r = 0.536, p = 0.003) or low urine osmolality (r = -0.556, p = 0.009) - got lost post-injury, the ANP release was triggered by volume load (p < 0.005). High ANP levels correlated with the neuroendocrine stress response, i.e., high cortisol (p = 0.05) and prolactin (p < 0.001) levels.

Severe traumatic head injury affects systemic cytokine expression.,"LaPar, Damien J; Rosenberger, Laura H; Walters, Dustin M; Hedrick, Traci L; Swenson, Brian R; Young, Jeffrey S; Dossett, Lesly A; May, Addison K; Sawyer, Robert G","BACKGROUND: The neuroimmunologic effect of traumatic head injury remains ill-defined. This study aimed to characterize systemic cytokine profiles among traumatically injured patients to assess the effect of traumatic head injury on the systemic inflammatory response., STUDY DESIGN: For 5 years, 1,022 patients were evaluated from a multi-institutional Trauma Immunomodulatory Database. Patients were stratified by presence of severe head injury (SHI; head Injury Severity Score >=4, n = 335) vs nonsevere head injury (NHI; head Injury Severity Score <=3, n = 687). Systemic cytokine expression was quantified by ELISA within 72 hours of admission. Patient factors, outcomes, and cytokine profiles were compared by univariate analyses., RESULTS: SHI patients were more severely injured with higher mortality, despite similar ICU infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia rates. Expression of early proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (p < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p = 0.02), was higher among NHI patients, and expression of immunomodulatory cytokines, interferon-gamma (p = 0.01) and interleukin-12 (p = 0.003), was higher in SHI patients. High tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in NHI patients were associated with mortality (p = 0.01), increased mechanical ventilation (p = 0.02), and development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (p = 0.01). Alternatively, among SHI patients, high interleukin-2 levels were associated with survival, decreased mechanical ventilation, and absence of ventilator-associated pneumonia., CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe traumatic head injury significantly alters systemic cytokine expression and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. Early recognition of these profiles can allow for targeted intervention to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. Copyright Â© 2012 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Residual brain dysfunction observed one year post-mild traumatic brain injury: combined EEG and balance study.,"Slobounov, Semyon; Sebastianelli, Wayne; Hallett, Mark","OBJECTIVES: There is still considerable debate and controversy about whether EEG can be used as a robust clinical tool for assessment of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Nonhomogeneous subject populations, inaccurate assessment of severity of brain injury, time since injury when EEG testing was performed, the lack of EEG research conducted serially and in conjunction with other behavioral measures as injury evolves over time may contribute to the existing controversies. In this study, we implemented a concussion assessment protocol combining a series of EEG and balance measures throughout one year post-injury to document the efficacy of EEG and balance measures as relate to differential recovery of patients suffering from MTBI., METHODS: Three hundred and eighty subjects at risk for MTBI were initially recruited for baseline testing. Forty nine from this initial subjects pool subsequently suffered a single episode of concussive blow and were tested on day 7, 15, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post-injury. EEGs were recorded while sitting, standing on the force plate and then on a foam base of support with eyes open/closed conditions. EEG alpha power (8-12 Hz) and its percent suppression from sitting to standing postures were computed. The center of pressure (COP) measures were obtained from the force platform and analyzed for eyes open and eyes closed conditions., RESULTS: Percent alpha power suppression from sitting to standing postural conditions significantly increased in MTBI subjects shortly after the injury (p<0.01). Percent alpha power suppression significantly correlated with increased area of COP during standing posture with eye closed (r(2)=0.53, p<0.01). The magnitude of alpha power suppression predicted the rate of recovery of this measure in sub-acute and chronic phases of injury (r(2)=0.609, p<0.01). Finally, 85% of MTBI subjects who showed more than 20% of alpha power suppression in the acute phase of injury did not return to pre-injury status up to 12 months post-injury., CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of serially implemented EEG measures in conjunction with balance assessment over the course of MTBI evolution to document residual cerebral dysfunction was demonstrated. Specifically, alteration of EEG alpha power dynamics in conjunction with balance data in the acute phase of injury with respect to baseline measures may predict the rate of recovery from a single concussive blow., SIGNIFICANCE: Neurophysiological measures are excellent tools to assess the status and prognosis of patients with MTBI.

Prognostic value of diffusion tensor imaging parameters in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Betz, Joshua; Zhuo, Jiachen; Roy, Anindya; Shanmuganathan, Kathirkamanthan; Gullapalli, Rao P","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently emerged as a useful tool for assessing traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, the prognostic value of the relationship between DTI measures and the clinical status of severe TBI patients, both at the time of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their discharge to acute TBI rehabilitation, was assessed. Patients (n=59) admitted to the trauma center with severe closed head injuries were retrospectively evaluated after approval from the institution's institutional review board, to determine the prognostic value of DTI measures. The relationship of DTI measures, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (lambda, , ) and radial diffusivity (lambda) from the whole brain white matter, internal capsule, genu, splenium, and body of the corpus callosum, were compared with neurological status at MRI and at discharge to acute TBI rehabilitation. Whole brain white matter averages of ADC, lambda, , , and lambda, and their coefficient of variation (CV) were significantly correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on the day of MRI. The average lambda, ,  was significantly correlated with GCS scores on the day of MRI in all measured brain regions. Outcomes were associated with whole brain white matter averages of ADC and lambda, , , and the CVs of FA, ADC, lambda, , , and lambda; and the averages and CVs of FA and lambda, ,  in all corpus callosum regions. The inclusion of regional and global DTI measures improved the accuracy of prognostic models, when adjusted for admission GCS score and age (p<0.05).

Computed tomography-estimated specific gravity at hospital admission predicts 6-month outcome in mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury patients admitted to the intensive care unit.,"Degos, Vincent; Lescot, Thomas; Icke, Christian; Le Manach, Yannick; Fero, Katherin; Sanchez, Paola; Hadiji, Bassem; Zouaoui, Abederrezak; Boch, Anne-Laure; Abdennour, Lamine; Apfel, Christian C; Puybasset, Louis","BACKGROUND: It is clear that patients with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) develop secondary, potentially lethal neurological deterioration. However, it is difficult to predict which patients with mild-to-moderate TBI (MM-TBI), even after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, will experience poor outcome at 6 months. Standard computed tomography (CT) imaging scans provide information that can be used to estimate specific gravity (eSG). We have previously demonstrated that higher eSG measurements in the standard CT reading were associated with poor outcomes after severe TBI. The aim of this study was to determine whether eSG of the intracranial content predicts 6-month outcome in MM-TBI., METHODS: We analyzed admission clinical and CT scan data (including eSG) of 66 patients with MM-TBI subsequently admitted to our neurosurgical ICU. Primary outcome was defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1 to 3 after 6 months. Discriminating power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC-AUC], 95% confidence interval) of eSG to predict 6-month poor outcome was calculated. The correlation of eSG with the main ICU characteristics was then compared., RESULTS: Univariate and stepwise multivariate analyses showed an independent association between eSG and 6-month poor outcome (P = 0.001). ROC-AUC of eSG for the prediction of 6-month outcomes was 0.87 (confidence interval: 0.77-0.96). Admission eSG values were correlated with the main ICU characteristics, specifically 14-day mortality (P = 0.004), length of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.01), length of ICU stay (P = 0.045), and ICU procedures such as intracranial pressure monitoring (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this MM-TBI cohort admitted to the ICU, eSG of routine CT scans was correlated with mortality, ICU severity, and predicted 6-month poor outcome.

Prognostic relevance of circulating endothelial progenitor cells for severe traumatic brain injury.,"Gong, Dasen; Hao, Mu; Liu, Li; Liu, Chunxiang; Dong, Jingfei; Cui, Zhuang; Sun, Lin; Su, Shaobo; Zhang, Jianning","OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) promotes the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into the injured tissue where EPCs play an important role in repairing injured vasculature. However, the repair mechanism and prognostic significance of EPCs after TBI remain poorly understood., METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 21 patients with severe TBI and 20 healthy subjects. EPCs were quantified by flow cytometry and serum VEGF and MMP-9 level measured by ELISA on days 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 after TBI., RESULTS: EPCs in the patients decreased originally, then increased to the peak level at 7 days and was significantly correlated with GOS scores 6 months after TBI. VEGF and MMP-9 were significantly increased during the follow-up period after TBI. EPCs was also positively correlated with GCS score 1 day after TBI and with MMP-9 and VEGF 7 days and 14 days after TBI., CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that TBI led to an increase of EPCs, VEGF and MMP-9, suggesting that increased VEGF and MMP-9 may mediate the recruitment of bone marrow-derived EPCs into the circulation.

Decreased plasma gelsolin is associated with 1-year outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Jin, Yong; Li, Bo-You; Qiu, Ling-Li; Ling, Yuan-Ren; Bai, Zhi-Qiang","PURPOSE: Decreased plasma gelsolin level has been associated with 1-month mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, we investigated the ability of gelsolin to predict 1-year mortality and functional outcome in these patients., METHODS: One hundred fourteen healthy controls and 114 patients with acute severe TBI were included in this study. Plasma gelsolin concentration on admission was measured by ELISA., RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (48.2%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) and 38 patients (33.3%) died in 1 year after TBI. Upon admission, plasma gelsolin level in patients was substantially lower than that in healthy controls. A multivariate analysis selected plasma gelsolin level as an independent predictor for 1-year unfavorable outcome and mortality of patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed plasma gelsolin level predicted 1-year unfavorable outcome and mortality statistically significantly. The predictive value of the gelsolin concentration was thus similar to that of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. In a combined logistic-regression model, gelsolin did not statistically significantly improve the area under curve of GCS score., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma gelsolin level is a useful, complementary tool to predict functional outcome and mortality 1 year after TBI.

Impact of non-neurological complications in severe traumatic brain injury outcome.,"Corral, Luisa; Javierre, Casimiro F; Ventura, Josep L; Marcos, Pilar; Herrero, Jose I; Manez, Rafael","INTRODUCTION: Non-neurological complications in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequent, worsening the prognosis, but the pathophysiology of systemic complications after TBI is unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze non-neurological complications in patients with severe TBI admitted to the ICU, the impact of these complications on mortality, and their possible correlation with TBI severity., METHODS: An observational retrospective cohort study was conducted in one multidisciplinary ICU of a university hospital (35 beds); 224 consecutive adult patients with severe TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9) admitted to the ICU were included. Neurological and non-neurological variables were recorded., RESULTS: Sepsis occurred in 75% of patients, respiratory infections in 68%, hypotension in 44%, severe respiratory failure (arterial oxygen pressure/oxygen inspired fraction ratio (PaO2/FiO2) < 200) in 41% and acute kidney injury (AKI) in 8%. The multivariate analysis showed that Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at one year was independently associated with age, initial GCS 3 to 5, worst Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) first computed tomography (CT) scan and the presence of intracranial hypertension but not AKI. Hospital mortality was independently associated with initial GSC 3 to 5, worst TCDB first CT scan, the presence of intracranial hypertension and AKI. The presence of AKI regardless of GCS multiplied risk of death 6.17 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37 to 27.78) (P < 0.02), while ICU hypotension increased the risk of death in patients with initial scores of 3 to 5 on the GCS 4.28 times (95% CI: 1.22 to 15.07) (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Low initial GCS, worst first CT scan, intracranial hypertension and AKI determined hospital mortality in severe TBI patients. Besides the direct effect of low GCS on mortality, this neurological condition also is associated with ICU hypotension which increases hospital mortality among patients with severe TBI. These findings add to previous studies that showed that non-neurological complications increase the length of stay and morbidity in the ICU but do not increase mortality, with the exception of AKI and hypotension in low GCS (3 to 5).",2012,/,"Critical care (London, England)",16,2,R44,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc11243,22410278,#8858,Corral 2012,,yes

Brain injury biomarkers may improve the predictive power of the IMPACT outcome calculator.,"Czeiter, Endre; Mondello, Stefania; Kovacs, Noemi; Sandor, Janos; Gabrielli, Andrea; Schmid, Kara; Tortella, Frank; Wang, Kevin K W; Hayes, Ronald L; Barzo, Pal; Ezer, Erzsebet; Doczi, Tamas; Buki, Andras","Outcome prediction following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a widely investigated field of research. A major breakthrough is represented by the IMPACT prognostic calculator based on admission data of more than 8500 patients. A growing body of scientific evidence has shown that clinically meaningful biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), and alphaII-spectrin breakdown product (SBDP145), could also contribute to outcome prediction. The present study was initiated to assess whether the addition of biomarkers to the IMPACT prognostic calculator could improve its predictive power. Forty-five sTBI patients (GCS score<=8) from four different sites were investigated. We utilized the core model of the IMPACT calculator (age, GCS motor score, and reaction of pupils), and measured the level of GFAP, UCH-L1, and SBDP145 in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The forecast and actual 6-month outcomes were compared by logistic regression analysis. The results of the core model itself, as well as serum values of GFAP and CSF levels of SBDP145, showed a significant correlation with the 6-month mortality using a univariate analysis. In the core model, the Nagelkerke R(2) value was 0.214. With multivariate analysis we were able to increase this predictive power with one additional biomarker (GFAP in CSF) to R(2)=0.476, while the application of three biomarker levels (GFAP in CSF, GFAP in serum, and SBDP145 in CSF) increased the Nagelkerke R(2) to 0.700. Our preliminary results underline the importance of biomarkers in outcome prediction, and encourage further investigation to expand the predictive power of contemporary outcome calculators and prognostic models in TBI.",2012,/,Journal of neurotrauma,29,9,1770-8,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.2127,22435839,#8845,Czeiter 2012,,yes
Change in plasma gelsolin level after traumatic brain injury.,"Xu, Jin-Fang; Liu, Wei-Guo; Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Yang, Song-Bin; Fan, Jing","BACKGROUND: Plasma gelsolin depletion has been associated with poor outcome of critically ill patients. However, there is a paucity of data available on circulating plasma gelsolin concentration in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, we sought to investigate change in plasma gelsolin level after TBI and to evaluate its relation with disease outcome., METHODS: Fifty healthy controls and 94 patients with acute severe TBI were included. Plasma samples were obtained on admission and at days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Its concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (27.7%) died from TBI in a month. After TBI, plasma gelsolin level in patients decreased during the 6-hour period immediately, was at the nadir in 24 hours, increased gradually thereafter, and was substantially lower than that in healthy controls during the 7-day period. A multivariate analysis showed plasma gelsolin level was an independent predictor for 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 0.941; 95% confidence interval, 0.895- 0.989; p = 0.017) and positively associated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (t = 6.538, p 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve identified that a baseline plasma gelsolin level 52.7 mg/L predicted 1-month mortality with 88.5% sensitivity and 79.4% specificity (area under the curve, 0.869; 95%confidence interval, 0.783- 0.930). The predictive value of the gelsolin concentration was thus similar to that of GCS scores (p =0.185). However, gelsolin did not statistically significantly improve the area under the curve of GCS scores (p = 0.517)., CONCLUSIONS: Decreased plasma gelsolin level is associated with GCS scores and an independent prognostic marker of mortality after TBI. Reversing plasma gelsolin deficiency may be an effective treatment for TBI.

Pupil evaluation in addition to Glasgow Coma Scale components in prediction of traumatic brain injury and mortality.,"Hoffmann, M; Lefering, R; Rueger, J M; Kolb, J P; Izbicki, J R; Ruecker, A H; Rupprecht, M; Lehmann, W; Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery","BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and prediction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for determining treatment strategies and allocating resources. This study evaluated the predictive accuracy of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) verbal, motor and eye components alone, or in addition to pupil size and reactivity, for TBI., METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of data from 51 425 severely injured patients registered in the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery from 1993 to 2009 was undertaken. Only directly admitted patients alive on admission and with complete data on GCS, pupil size and pupil reactivity were included. The unadjusted predictive roles of GCS components and pupil parameters, alone or in combination, were modelled using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses and multivariable logistic regression regarding presence of TBI and death., RESULTS: Some 24 115 patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Best accuracy for outcome prediction was found for pupil reactivity (AUROC 0.770, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.761 to 0.779) and GCS motor component (AUROC 0.797, 0.788 to 0.805), with less accuracy for GCS eye and verbal components. The combination of pupil reactivity and GCS motor component (AUROC 0.822, 0.814 to 0.830) outmatched the predictive accuracy of GCS alone (AUROC 0.808, 0.800 to 0.815). Pupil reactivity and size were significantly correlated (r(s) = 0.56, P < 0.001). Patients displaying both unequal pupils and fixed pupils were most likely to have TBI (95.1 per cent of 283 patients). Good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or more) was documented for only 1929 patients (8.0 per cent) showing fixed and bilateral dilated pupils., CONCLUSION: The best predictive accuracy for presence of TBI was obtained using the GCS components.

Continuous monitoring of cerebrovascular reactivity using pulse waveform of intracranial pressure.,"Aries, Marcel J H; Czosnyka, Marek; Budohoski, Karol P; Kolias, Angelos G; Radolovich, Danila K; Lavinio, Andrea; Pickard, John D; Smielewski, Peter","BACKGROUND: Guidelines for the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) call for the development of accurate methods for assessment of the relationship between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral autoregulation and to determine the influence of quantitative indices of pressure autoregulation on outcome. We investigated the relationship between slow fluctuations of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse amplitude (an index called PAx) using a moving correlation technique to reflect the state of cerebral vasoreactivity and compared it to the index of pressure reactivity (PRx) as a moving correlation coefficient between averaged values of ABP and ICP., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospective 327 TBI patients (admitted on neurocritical care unit of a university hospital in the period 2003-2009) with continuous ABP and ICP monitoring., RESULTS: PAx was worse in patients who died compared to those who survived (-0.04 +/- 0.15 vs. -0.16 +/- 0.15, chi2 = 28, p < 0.001). In contrast to PRx, PAx was able to differentiate between fatal and non-fatal outcome in a group of 120 patients with ICP levels below 15 mmHg (-0.04 +/- 0.16 vs. -0.14 +/- 0.16, chi2 = 6, p = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: PAx is a new modified index of cerebrovascular reactivity which performs equally well as established PRx in long-term monitoring in severe TBI patients, but importantly is potentially more robust at lower values of ICP.

GFAP and S100B in the acute phase of mild traumatic brain injury.,"Metting, Z; Wilczak, N; Rodiger, L A; Schaaf, J M; van der Naalt, J","OBJECTIVE: The biomarkers glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and S100B are increasingly used as prognostic tools in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Data for mild TBI are scarce. This study aims to analyze the predictive value of GFAP and S100B for outcome in mild TBI and the relation with imaging., METHODS: In 94 patients biomarkers were determined directly after admission. Collected data included injury severity, patient characteristics, admission CT, and MRI 3 months postinjury. Six months postinjury outcome was determined with Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) and return to work (RTW)., RESULTS: Mean GFAP was 0.25 mug/L (SD 1.08) and S100B 0.54 mug/L (SD 1.18). In 63% GFAP was not discernible. GFAP was increased in patients with an abnormal CT (1.20 mug/L, SD 2.65) compared to normal CT (0.05 mug/L, SD 0.17, p < 0.05). Also in patients with axonal injury on MRI GFAP was higher (0.65 mug/L, SD 0.91 vs 0.07 mug/L, SD 0.2, p < 0.05). GFAP was increased in patients with incomplete RTW compared to complete RTW (0.69 mug/L, SD 2.11 vs 0.12 mug/L, SD 0.38, p < 0.05). S100B was not related to outcome or imaging studies. In multivariate analysis GFAP was not predictive for outcome determined by GOSE and RTW., CONCLUSIONS: A relation between GFAP with imaging studies and outcome (determined by RTW) was found in contrast to S100B.

The main objectives of this work are to correlate brain stem injuries detected at MR imaging with outcome at 6 months in patients with severe TBI, and to determine which MR imaging findings could be related to a worse prognosis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eight patients with severe TBI were studied by MR imaging in the first 30 days after trauma. Brain stem injury was categorized as anterior or posterior, hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic, and unilateral or bilateral. Outcome measures were GOSE and Barthel Index 6 months postinjury. The relationship between MR imaging findings of brain stem injuries, outcome, and disability was explored by univariate analysis. Prognostic capability of MR imaging findings was also explored by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve for poor and good outcome., RESULTS: Brain stem lesions were detected in 51 patients, of whom 66% showed a poor outcome, as expressed by the GOSE scale. Bilateral involvement was strongly associated with poor outcome (P < .05). Posterior location showed the best discriminatory capability in terms of outcome (OR 6.8, P < .05) and disability (OR 4.8, P < .01). The addition of nonhemorrhagic and anterior lesions or unilateral injuries showed the highest odds and best discriminatory capacity for good outcome., CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis worsens in direct relationship to the extent of traumatic injury.

A time trend of CPPopt was created using a moving 4-hr window, updated every minute. Identification of CPPopt was, on average, feasible during 55% of the whole recording period. Patient outcome correlated with the continuously updated difference between median CPP and CPPopt (chi-square=45, p<.001; outcome dichotomized into fatal and nonfatal). Mortality was associated with relative ""hypoperfusion"" (CPPCPPopt), and favorable outcome was associated with smaller deviations of CPP from the individualized CPPopt. While deviations from global target CPP values of 60 mm Hg and 70 mm Hg were also related to outcome, these relationships were less robust., CONCLUSIONS: Real-time CPPopt could be identified during the recording time of majority of the patients. Patients with a median CPP close to CPPopt were more likely to have a favorable outcome than those in whom median CPP was widely different from CPPopt. Deviations from individualized CPPopt were more predictive of outcome than deviations from a common target CPP.

Traditional systolic blood pressure targets underestimate hypotension-induced secondary brain injury.,"Brenner, Megan; Stein, Deborah M; Hu, Peter F; Aarabi, Bizhan; Sheth, Kevin; Scalea, Thomas M","BACKGROUND: Vital signs, particularly blood pressure, are often manipulated to maximize perfusion and optimize recovery from severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). We investigated the utility of automated continuously recorded vital signs to predict outcomes after sTBI., METHODS: Sixty patients with head Abbreviated Injury Scale score >= 3, age >14 years, ""isolated"" TBI, and need for intracranial pressure monitoring were prospectively enrolled at a single, large urban tertiary care facility. Outcome was measured by mortality and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 12 months. Continuous, automated, digital data were collected every 6 seconds for 72 hours after admission, and 5-minute means of systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded. We calculated SBP as pressure x time dose (PTD) to describe the cumulative amplitude and duration of episodes above and below clinical thresholds. The extent and duration of the insults were calculated as percent time (%time), PTD, and PTD per day (PTD/D) of defined thresholds (SBP: <90 mm Hg, <100 mm Hg, <110 mm Hg, and <120 mm Hg; mean arterial pressure: <60 mm Hg and <70 mm Hg; heart rate: >100 bpm and >120 bpm; and SpO(2): <88% and <92%) for the first 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours of intensive care unit admission. We analyzed their ability to predict mortality and GOSE by receiver operator characteristics., RESULTS: Mean age was 33.9 (range, 16-83) years, mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale score 6.4 +/- 3, and mean head Abbreviated Injury Scale score 4.2 +/- 0.72. The 30-day mortality rate was 13.3%. Of the 45 patients in whom GOSE at 12 months was available, 28 (62%) had good neurologic outcomes (GOSE score >4). Traditional markers of poor outcome (admission SBP, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, and Marshall score) were not different between groups with good or poor outcome. PTD, PTD/D, and %time SBP <110 mm Hg and SBP <120 mm Hg predicted mortality at 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours (p < 0.04). Percent time SBP <110 mm Hg in the first 24 hours was predictive of 12-month GOSE (p = 0.02). PTD/D SBP <120 mm Hg in the first 24 hours and PTD and PTD/D in the first 48 hours were also predictive of 12-month GOSE (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Within the first 48 hours of intensive care unit admission, hypotension was found to be predictive of mortality and functional outcomes at higher thresholds than traditionally defined. Systemic blood pressure targets closer to 120 mm Hg may be more efficacious in minimizing secondary insults and particularly useful in settings without invasive intracranial monitoring capabilities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, prognostic study.",2012,/,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,72,5,1135-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31824af90b,22673237,#8760,Brenner 2012,,yes
The first 72 hours of brain tissue oxygenation predicts patient survival with traumatic brain injury.,"Eriksson, Evert A; Barletta, Jeffrey F; Figueroa, Bryan E; Bonnell, Bruce W; Sloffer, Chris A; Vanderkolk, Wayne E; McAllen, Karen J; Ott, Mickey","BACKGROUND: Utilization of brain tissue oxygenation (pBtO(2)) is an important but controversial variable in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. We hypothesize that pBtO(2) values over the first 72 hours of monitoring are predictive of mortality., METHODS: Consecutive, adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury and pBtO(2) monitors were retrospectively identified. Time-indexed measurements of pBtO(2), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and intracranial pressure (ICP) were collected, and average values over 4-hour blocks were determined. Patients were stratified according to survival, and repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare pBtO(2), CPP, and ICP. The pBtO(2) threshold most predictive for survival was determined., RESULTS: There were 8,759 time-indexed data points in 32 patients. The mean age was 39 years +/- 16.5 years, injury severity score was 27.7 +/- 10.7, and Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6.6 +/- 3.4. Survival was 68%. Survivors consistently demonstrated higher pBtO(2) values compared with nonsurvivors including age as a covariate (F = 12.898, p < 0.001). Individual pBtO(2) was higher at the time points 8 hours, 12 hours, 20 hours to 44 hours, 52 hours to 60 hours, and 72 hours of monitoring (p < 0.05). There was no difference in ICP (F = 1.690, p = 0.204) and CPP (F = 0.764, p = 0.389) values between survivors and nonsurvivors including age as a covariate. Classification and regression tree analysis identified 29 mm Hg as the threshold at which pBtO(2) was most predictive for mortality., CONCLUSION: The first 72 hours of pBtO(2) neurologic monitoring predicts mortality. When the pBtO(2) monitor remains below 29 mm Hg in the first 72 hours of monitoring, mortality is increased.

Intraventricular hemorrhage on computed tomography and corpus callosum injury on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with isolated blunt traumatic brain injury.,"Matsukawa, Hidetoshi; Shinoda, Masaki; Fujii, Motoharu; Takahashi, Osamu; Murakata, Atsushi; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Sumiyoshi, Sosuke; Ishikawa, Ryoichi","OBJECT: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is widely regarded as one element of a complex involving severe blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI); corpus callosum injury (CCI) is recently considered to be one factor associated with poor outcome in patients with TBI. Although postmortem studies have focused on the relationship between IVH and CCI, there have been few investigations of IVH evidenced on CT scans as a predictor of CCI evidenced on MRI., METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from 371 patients with blunt TBI, without trauma to the face, chest, abdomen, extremities, or pelvic girdle, requiring immediate therapeutic intervention. Their aim was to investigate whether IVH found on CT predicts CCI on MRI. Clinical and radiological data were collected between June 2003 and February 2011. First, the authors classified patients into groups of those with CCI and those without CCI, and they compared clinical and radiological findings between them. Then, they investigated prognostic factors that were related to the development of disability at 6 months after injury. The outcomes at 6 months after injury were evaluated using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E). Finally, the authors evaluated the correlation between the severity of the IVH on CT and the number of CCI lesions on MRI. The severity of the IVH was defined by the number of ventricles in which IVH was seen, and the number of CCI lesions was counted on the MRI study., RESULTS: On multivariate logistic regression analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 (OR 2.70 [95% CI 1.10-6.27]), traffic accident (OR 2.59 [95% CI 1.37-4.93]), and IVH on CT (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.25-8.49]) were significantly related to CCI. Multivariate analysis also showed that older age (p = 0.0001), male sex (OR 3.26 [95% CI 1.46-8.08], p = 0.0065), Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 (OR 8.27 [95% CI 3.39-21.4], p < 0.0001), evidence of IVH on CT (OR 4.09 [95% CI 1.45-11.9], p = 0.0081), and evidence of CCI on MRI (OR 8.32 [95% CI 3.89-18.8], p < 0.0001) were associated with future development of disability (GOS-E score <= 6). Furthermore, simple regression analysis revealed the existence of a strong correlation between the severity of IVH and the number of CCI lesions (r = 0.0668, p = 0.0022)., CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that evidence of IVH on CT may indicate CCI, which can lead to disability in patients with isolated blunt TBI.",2012,/,Journal of neurosurgery,117,2,334-9,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2012.5.JNS112318,22702486,#8738,Matsukawa 2012,,yes

Patients with acute temporary or delayed coagulopathy had the worst TCDB CT classification scores, while mortality rates were the highest in patients with sustained or delayed coagulopathy., CONCLUSIONS: Not only the mere presence of coagulopathy, but also the course of haemostatic alterations following neurotrauma may hold predictive value for patient outcome, irrespective of the severity level of cerebral injury.",2012,/,Brain injury,26,12,1464-71,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.694566,22721350,#8735,Franschman 2012,,yes
Multiple indicators model of long-term mortality in traumatic brain injury.,"Gradisek, Primoz; Osredkar, Josko; Korsic, Marjan; Kremzar, Boriana","OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic ability of protein S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) for prediction of 1-year mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in relation to clinical and radiological characteristics of TBI., METHODS: Brain injury was quantified in 84 patients (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <= 12) using clinical (GCS, pupils), radiological (computed tomography [CT] classification and individual CT characteristics) and biochemical (S100B, NSE and GFAP) data at admission and in the acute post-injury period., RESULTS: Initial and peak S100B, NSE and GFAP concentrations were higher in non-survivors (n = 26) than in survivors (p-value range: <0.001-0.018). Cox regression showed that GFAP and S100B concentration and the temporal profile of S100B were more powerful independent predictors of mortality than baseline clinical and radiological characteristics or clinical and radiological indicators of neurological deterioration. The prognostic models containing admission variables and those available during the subsequent clinical course showed the same discrimination ability (area under receiver characteristic curve 0.92), but the model based on variables available in the acute post-injury period calibrated better (p = 0.428)., CONCLUSION: Mortality at 1-year post-TBI is accurately predicted by the combination of GFAP and S100B concentration and clinical and radiological characteristics at admission or in the acute post-injury period.",2012,/,Brain injury,26,12,1472-81,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.694567,22721420,#8734,Gradisek 2012,,yes

Intracranial pressure and arterial blood pressure waveforms were low-pass filtered to remove the respiratory and pulse components and then processed using a multiscale entropy algorithm to produce a complexity index. We identified significant differences across groups classified by the Glasgow Outcome Scale in intracranial pressure, pressure-reactivity index and complexity index of intracranial pressure (P < 0.0001; P = 0.001; P < 0.0001, respectively). Outcome was dichotomized as survival/death and also as favourable/unfavourable. The complexity index of intracranial pressure achieved the strongest statistical significance (F = 28.7; P < 0.0001 and F = 17.21; P < 0.0001, respectively) and was identified as a significant independent predictor of mortality and favourable outcome in a multivariable logistic regression model (P < 0.0001).

Predicting outcomes after traumatic brain injury: the development and validation of prognostic models based on admission characteristics.,"Yuan, Fang; Ding, Jun; Chen, Hao; Guo, Yan; Wang, Gan; Gao, Wen-Wei; Chen, Shi-Wen; Tian, Heng-Li","BACKGROUND: Early estimation of prognosis for the patient with traumatic brain injury is an important factor in making treatment decisions, resource allocation, classify patients, or communicating with family. We aimed to develop and validate practical prognostic models for mortality at 30 days and for 6 months unfavorable outcome after moderate and severe traumatic brain injury., METHODS: Retrospectively collected data from our department were used to develop prognostic models for outcome. We developed four prognostic models based on admission predictors with logistic regression analysis. The performance of models was assessed with respect to discrimination and calibration. Discriminative ability was evaluated with C statistic, equal to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Calibrative ability was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (H-L test). The internal validity of models was evaluated with the bootstrap re-sampling technique. We validated three of the models in an external series of 203 patients that collected from another research center. Discrimination and calibration were further assessed to indicate the performance of the models in external patients., RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that age, pupillary reactivity, motor Glasgow Coma Score, computed tomography characters, glucose, hemoglobin, D-dimer, serum calcium, and intracranial pressure were independent prognostic factors of outcome. The models discriminated well in the development patients (C statistic 0.709-0.939). We extensively validate three of the models. Internal validation showed no overoptimism in any of the models' predictive C statistics. External validity was much better (C statistic 0.844-0.902). Calibration was also good (H-L tests, p > 0.05). Computer-based calculator that based on prognostic models was developed for clinical use., CONCLUSION: Our validated prognostic models have good performance and are generalizable to be used to predict outcome of new patients.

'Long' pressure reactivity index (L-PRx) as a measure of autoregulation correlates with outcome in traumatic brain injury patients.,"Sanchez-Porras, Renan; Santos, Edgar; Czosnyka, Marek; Zheng, Zelong; Unterberg, Andreas W; Sakowitz, Oliver W","BACKGROUND: Cerebral autoregulation and, consequently, cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, can be disturbed after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Continuous monitoring of autoregulation has shown its clinical importance as an independent predictor of neurological outcome. The cerebral pressure reactivity index (PRx) reflects that changes in seconds of cerebrovascular reactivity have prognostic significance. Using an alternative algorithm similar to PRx, we investigate whether the utilization of lower-frequency changes of the order of minutes of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) could have a prognostic value in TBI patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Head-injured patients requiring continued advanced multimodal monitoring, including hemodynamic, ICP and microdialysis (MD) monitoring, were analyzed retrospectively. A low-frequency sample pressure reactivity index (L-PRx) was calculated, using 20-min averages of MAP and ICP data as a linear Pearson's correlation. The mean values per patient were correlated to outcome at 6 months after injury. Differences of monitoring parameters between non-survivors and survivors were compared., RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (mean age 37.2 years, 26 males) suffering from TBI were monitored for a mean of 109.6 h (16-236 h, SD +/- 60.4). Mean L-PRx was found to be of 0.1 (-0.2 to 0.6, SD +/- 0.20), six patients presented impaired (>0.2) values. The averaged L-PRx correlated significantly with ICP (r = 0.467, p = 0.011) and 6-month outcome (r = -0.556, p = 0.002). Significant statistical differences were found in L-PRx, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), lactate, and lactate-pyruvate ratio when comparing patients who died (n = 5) and patients who survived., CONCLUSIONS: L-PRx correlates with the 6-month outcome in TBI patients.

Plasma HMGB1 concentration of 106 healthy subjects and 106 patients with severe TBI was measured by ELISA. The correlation with 1-y mortality and unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) was analyzed., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (29.2%) died and 48 patients (45.3%) had an unfavorable outcome at 1 y after TBI. Plasma HMGB1 level was substantially higher in patients than in healthy controls. A multivariate analysis selected plasma HMGB1 level as an independent predictor for 1-y mortality and unfavorable outcome of patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed plasma HMGB1 level statistically significantly predicted 1-y mortality and unfavorable outcome. The prognostic value of HMGB1 was similar to that of Glasgow Coma Scale score for 1-y clinical outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma HMGB1 concentration emerges as a novel biomarker for predicting 1-y clinical outcomes of TBI.

Traumatic brain injury in the elderly: considerations in a series of 103 patients older than 70.,"Gaetani, P; Revay, M; Sciacca, S; Pessina, F; Aimar, E; Levi, D; Morenghi, E","AIM: Mortality and morbidity due to brain injury in the elderly population is a growing clinical problem: among older patients, those >70 years have a considerably higher risk both in terms of mortality and morbidity. Thereafter, the reasons influencing outcome have not been clearly examined: in the present study we addressed these questions considering the main clinical characteristics exerting a significant impact on the outcome of patients aged > 70, with emphasis for the severity of brain injury and anticoagulant (CAW) treatments., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 103 consecutive isolated head injury patients older than 70, admitted at our Department in the period November 2004-November 2009. The clinical variables considered were as follow: age, sex, type of TBI, GCS, pre-TBI use of anti-coagulants (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel), INR at admission (INR values were subdivided in values >1.25 as at risk for hemorrhagic events and <1.25 as normal), initial CT scan classification looking at the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (t-SAH) or mass lesions; the main outcome measure was the Glasgow Outcome Scale., RESULTS: The most frequent cause of TBI was accidental fall (65%): 39 were in CAW therapies and in 36 cases the cause of falling down injury was recorded due to a sincopal event (arterial hypotension, atrial fibrillation); in the older patients an accidental fall is significantly related to the TBI, while in the patients aged 70-75 years, TBI is related to a traffic accident (P=0.002). Moreover the cause of TBI correlates with the CAW treatment, the accidental fall being significantly more frequent in patients in CAW treatment (P=0.003). Overall mortality rate is significantly related to an elevated INR class, to presence of t-SAH (16/50 patients) and subdural hematoma (26/46)., CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that in a population of patients aged > 70, TBI is a high risk event if patient has concurrent treatment with CAW therapies and if an accidental fall is the cause of TBI. In these cases the finding of t-SAH represents a high-risk parameter for mortality but not for morbidity.",2012,/,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,56,3,231-7,,,22854591,#8682,Gaetani 2012,,yes
Determinants of mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Saadat, Soheil; Akbari, Hesam; Khorramirouz, Reza; Mofid, Roza; Rahimi-Movaghar, Vafa","BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine factors associated with mortality rates in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Registered data of a national trauma project conducted in eight major cities in Iran during a five-year period were used. Patients with a TBI were identified and both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed., RESULTS: 2274 brain-injured patients including 1794 males (78.9%) were identified. The mean age of the patients was 30.1 +/- 19.11 years. The age of 345 patients was less than 12, while 137 patients were older than 65. 383 patients (16.9%) died as a result of their injury. Univariate analysis showed a significant association between mortality and the following factors: age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (BP), and respiratory rate (RR) (p<0.05).

Functional survival after acute care for severe head injury at a designated trauma center in Hong Kong.,"Taw, Benedict B T; Lam, Alan C S; Ho, Faith L Y; Hung, K N; Lui, W M; Leung, Gilberto K K","BACKGROUND: Severe head injury is known to be a major cause of early mortalities and morbidities. Patients' long-term outcome after acute care, however, has not been widely studied. We aim to review the outcome of severely head-injured patients after discharge from acute care at a designated trauma center in Hong Kong., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data of patients admitted with severe head injuries between 2004 and 2008. Patients' functional status post-discharge was assessed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE)., RESULTS: Of a total of 1565 trauma patients, 116 had severe head injuries and 41 of them survived acute hospital care. Upon the last follow-up, 23 (56.1%) of the acute-care survivors had improvements in their GOSE, six (11.8%) experienced deteriorations, and 12 (23.5%) did not exhibit any change. The greatest improvement was observed in patients with GOSE of 5 and 6 upon discharge, but two of the 16 patients with GOSE 2 or 3 also had a good recovery. On logistic regression analysis, old age and prolonged acute hospital stay were found to be independent predictors of poor functional outcome after a mean follow-up duration of 42 months., CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation service is an important component of comprehensive trauma care. Despite significant early mortalities, a proportion of severely head-injured patients who survive acute care may achieve good long-term functional recovery.

Increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury treated without intracranial pressure monitoring.,"Farahvar, Arash; Gerber, Linda M; Chiu, Ya-Lin; Carney, Nancy; Hartl, Roger; Ghajar, Jamshid","OBJECT: Evidence-based guidelines recommend intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there is limited evidence that monitoring and treating intracranial hypertension reduces mortality. This study uses a large, prospectively collected database to examine the effect on 2-week mortality of ICP reduction therapies administered to patients with severe TBI treated either with or without an ICP monitor., METHODS: From a population of 2134 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] Score <9), 1446 patients were treated with ICP-lowering therapies. Of those, 1202 had an ICP monitor inserted and 244 were treated without monitoring. Patients were admitted to one of 20 Level I and two Level II trauma centers, part of a New York State quality improvement program administered by the Brain Trauma Foundation between 2000 and 2009. This database also contains information on known independent early prognostic indicators of mortality, including age, admission GCS score, pupillary status, CT scanning findings, and hypotension., RESULTS: Age, initial GCS score, hypotension, and CT scan findings were associated with 2-week mortality. In addition, patients of all ages treated with an ICP monitor in place had lower mortality at 2 weeks (p = 0.02) than those treated without an ICP monitor, after adjusting for parameters that independently affect mortality., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe TBI treated for intracranial hypertension, the use of an ICP monitor is associated with significantly lower mortality when compared with patients treated without an ICP monitor.

Role of early cell-free DNA levels decrease as a predictive marker of fatal outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Macher, Hada; Egea-Guerrero, Juan J; Revuelto-Rey, Jaume; Gordillo-Escobar, Elena; Enamorado-Enamorado, Judy; Boza, Antonio; Rodriguez, Ana; Molinero, Patrocinio; Guerrero, Juan M; Dominguez-Roldan, Jose Maria; Murillo-Cabezas, Francisco; Rubio, Amalia","INTRODUCTION: Circulating cell-free DNA levels are increased after trauma injury. This increase is higher since the first hours after trauma and may be related with primary outcome. A sensitive and reliable biomarker for patients at higher risk is needed to identify these patients to initiate early intervention. In this way, circulating DNA may be a possible biological marker after severe TBI., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated DNA plasma concentrations after severe traumatic brain injury and during the next 96 h in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by real time PCR. 65 patients suffering severe TBI were included in the study., RESULTS: Cell-free DNA levels were considerably higher in patients samples compared with voluntary control ones. After the following four days we observed a 51% decrease during the first 24h and a 71% fall from 48 h. TBI population was stratified for the primary outcome (survivors/non-survivor) and DNA levels decrease ratio was calculated for the first 48 h. A higher decrease in the survivors from 0 h to 24h compared with the non-survivors was found. A cut-off point of 1.95 ratio was established for the detection of the highest proportions of patients after the TBI that will not survive after the injury with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%., CONCLUSIONS: In summary we showed that severe TBI is associated with elevated cf-DNA levels and we propose that cf-DNA decrease during the first 24h may predict patient outcome.

A longitudinal MRI study of traumatic axonal injury in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.,"Moen, Kent Goran; Skandsen, Toril; Folvik, Mari; Brezova, Veronika; Kvistad, Kjell Arne; Rydland, Jana; Manley, Geoffrey T; Vik, Anne","OBJECTIVE: To study the evolution of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) detected by structural MRI in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the first year and relate findings to outcome., METHODS: 58 patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-13) were examined with MRI at a median of 7 days, 3 months and 12 months post injury. TAI lesions were evaluated blinded and categorised into three stages based on location: hemispheres, corpus callosum and brainstem. Lesions in T2* weighted gradient echo (GRE), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were counted and FLAIR lesion volumes were estimated. Inter-rater reliability score was calculated. Outcome was assessed 12 months post injury using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: In the initial MRI, 31% had brainstem lesions compared with 17% at 3 months (p=0.008). In the FLAIR sequences, number and volumes of lesions were reduced from early to 3 months (p<0.001). In T2*GRE sequences, the number of lesions persisted at 3 months but was reduced at 12 months (p=0.007). The number of lesions in DWI and volume of FLAIR lesions on early MRI predicted worse clinical outcome in adjusted analyses (p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate and quantify attenuation of non-haemorrhagic TAI lesions on structural MRI during the first 3 months after TBI; most importantly, the disappearance of brainstem lesions. Haemorrhagic TAI lesions attenuate first after 3 months. Only early MRI findings predicted clinical outcome after adjustment for other prognostic factors.

Detecting lesions after traumatic brain injury using susceptibility weighted imaging: a comparison with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and correlation with clinical outcome.,"Spitz, Gershon; Maller, Jerome J; Ng, Amanda; O'Sullivan, Richard; Ferris, Nicholas J; Ponsford, Jennie L","The development and utilization of newer neuroimaging modalities provides the capability to more accurately detect the extent of pathology after TBI. The current study examined the ability of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to detect lesions after TBI as well as the relationship to subsequent clinical outcome. The performance of SWI was compared to that of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). This study comprised 79 individuals with mild-to-severe TBI, 38 of whom completed neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory, processing speed, memory, and executive functions. SWI was found to quantify a greater lesion volume over the entire brain, specifically in frontal, central, limbic, subcortical gray, and parietal brain regions, than did FLAIR. Moreover, SWI was able to identify TBI-related lesions in almost one third of patients for whom FLAIR was unable to detect any lesions. Greater overall SWI volume, as well as frontal SWI volume, was found to relate to the severity of TBI. Conversely, no association was found between FLAIR lesion volume and injury severity. In addition, there was some evidence that higher lesion volume, for both SWI and FLAIR, were associated with poorer memory as well as processing speed impairment. This study suggests that SWI may provide additional sensitivity in the detection of lesions after TBI. Consequently, this imaging sequence may provide a more accurate representation of the severity of individuals' injuries and their subsequent neuropsychological outcomes.",2013,/,Journal of neurotrauma,30,24,2038-50,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.3021,23952803,#8124,Spitz 2013,,yes
The influence of hemocoagulation disorders on the development of posttraumatic cerebral infarction and outcome in patients with moderate or severe head trauma.,"Chen, Hao; Xue, Li-Xia; Guo, Yan; Chen, Shi-Wen; Wang, Gan; Cao, He-Li; Chen, Jiong; Tian, Heng-Li","Posttraumatic cerebral infarction (PTCI) is a severe secondary insult of head injury and often leads to a poor prognosis. Hemocoagulation disorder is recognized to have important effects on hemorrhagic or ischemic damages. We sought to assess if posttraumatic hemocoagulation disorders were associated with cerebral infarction, and evaluate their influence on outcome among patients with moderate or severe head trauma. In this study, PTCI was observed in 28 (10.57%) of the 265 patients within the first week after injury. In multivariate analysis, the thrombocytopenia (odds ratio (OR) 2.210, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.065-4.674), abnormal prothrombin time (PT) (OR 3.241, 95% CI 1.090-7.648), D-dimer (>2 mg/L) (OR 7.260, 95% CI 1.822-28.076), or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scores (>= 5) (OR 4.717, 95% CI 1.778-12.517) were each independently associated with an increased risk of PTCI. Admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen, and D-dimer (>2 mg/L) and DIC scores (>= 5) showed an independent predictive effect on poor outcome.

We developed two prognostic models based on admission predictors with logistic regression analysis to assess the significance of thoracic injuries in determining the 30-day mortality and outcome. The internal validity of the models was evaluated with the bootstrap re-sampling technique. We also validated the models in an external series of 165 patients that collected from our center. Discriminative ability was evaluated with C statistic. Calibrative ability was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (H-L test)., RESULTS: Among 505 TBI patients admitted, 102 (20.2%) had thoracic injuries. Patients with a PCS >= 6 had a 3.142 and 8.065 times higher odds of mortality and poor outcome compared with patients with a PCS <6, respectively. Any one-score increase of the TTS had a 1.193 times higher odds of a poor outcome (p = 0.017).

In this study, we measured endostatin/collagen XVIII concentrations serially for 1 week after hospitalization by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 30 patients with TBI and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less on admission. There was a significant trend toward increased CSF levels of endostatin after TBI versus control from 72 h after injury. In patients with GCS score of 3-5, CSF endostatin concentration was substantially higher at 72 h after injury than that in patients with GCS score of 6-8 (P < 0.05) and peaked rapidly at day 5 after injury, but decreased thereafter.

In a concomitant web-based survey with clinical vignettes, outcome prognostication comfort, treatment aggressiveness, and WOC recommendations were examined among 106 respondents from neurology, neurocritical care, neurosurgery, trauma and anesthesia/critical care., RESULTS: The average age of the study sample was 53 years, with a median Glasgow Coma Scale of 6. The in-hospital CFR was 36 and 68 % of patients had WOC. Factors independently associated with WOC were advanced age, pupillary reactivity, lower intensive care unit-length-of-stay, pre- and in-hospital cardiac arrest, herniation, intracranial pressure crisis, and pre-existing endocrine disease. Inclusion of WOC in our multivariable regression model predicting in-hospital CFRs negated all other variables. Survey results suggested that in younger patients, some clinicians prognosticated overly pessimistically based upon data available at the time of presentation., CONCLUSION: In our msTBI cohort, WOC was the most important predictor of in-hospital mortality. We identified several important independent predictors of WOC. Large within-center variability in msTBI outcome prognostication with varying levels of possible clinical nihilism exists, which may form the basis of self-fulfilling prophecies.",2013,/,Neurocritical care,19,3,347-63,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-013-9925-z,24132565,#8056,Izzy 2013,,yes
Long-term neurological and neuropsychological outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Gautschi, Oliver P; Huser, Melanie C; Smoll, Nicolas R; Maedler, Sven; Bednarz, Stephan; von Hessling, Alexander; Lussmann, Roger; Hildebrandt, Gerhard; Seule, Martin A","BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. The aim of the study was to evaluate predictors for neurological and neuropsychological long-term outcome in patients with severe TBI treated according to an intracranial pressure (ICP-) targeted therapy., METHODS: From 08/2005 to 12/2008, 46 patients with severe TBI and more than 12h of intensive care treatment were included in this study. Neurological outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Neuropsychological performance assessing 9 different domains was evaluated at long-term follow-up (median 20.5 months; range 10-46). Logistic regression was used to identify favourable outcomes according to the GOS and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify predictors of severe neuropsychological impairments at follow-up., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were available for neuropsychological assessment at long-term follow-up. Only 2 out of 29 patients presented normal or average neuropsychological findings throughout all 9 neuropsychological domains at long-term follow-up. The percentage of a favourable outcome (GOS 4-5) increased from 13.8% at hospital discharge to 75.8% at rehabilitation discharge to 79.3% at long-term follow-up, respectively. Age <=40 was found to be a strong predictor of favourable outcome at follow-up (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.41 25.00, p=0.015). The GOS at hospital discharge was not a predictor for severe impairments in any of the 9 different neuropsychological domains (all p-values were p>0.268). In contrast, the GOS at rehabilitation discharge was found to be a predictor of severe impairments at follow-up in all but one domain assessed (all p-values less than p<0.038)., CONCLUSIONS: The GOS at rehabilitation discharge should be regarded as a better predictor for neuropsychological impairments at long-term follow-up than the GOS at hospital discharge. Even in patients with favourable GOS after finishing a course of rehabilitation, three quarters of these patients may have at least one severe neuropsychological deficit. Therefore, it remains of paramount importance to provide long-term neuropsychological support to further improve outcome after TBI. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of intracranial pressure measurement on survival in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Krbila, S; Waczulikova, I; Sobona, V; Zahorec, R","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess (i) a group of patients with established intracranial pressure (ICP) sensor in severe brain injuries scoring 3 points of Glasgow Coma Scale, (ii) mortality and survival of the patients within periods of 7, 30, 180 and 270 days; and (iii) predictive value of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure for short and long-term survival of patients with traumatic brain injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group consisted of 61 patients with trauma brain injury scoring 3 points of Glasgow Coma Scale, continuously monitored for intracranial pressure cerebral perfusion pressure at the Intensive Care Unit setting in Nove Zamky. Follow-up period was between 7 and 270 days. Measured values and other recorded data were analysed using methods of descriptive and inferential statistics., RESULTS: ICP values below 20 mmHg were associated with a significantly lower risk of death of an individual patient at particular time. Accordingly, cerebral perfusion pressure values above 70 mmHg during 0-2 days were associated with a significantly higher long-term survival. Overall mortality rates within 30 days showed no peaks on survival curves. In the periods of 0-7 days, within 30 days, and between 30 and 180 days we recorded 24, 51 and 2 deaths, respectively. In the period between 180 and 270 days, mortality was zero., CONCLUSION: The survival of trauma brain injury patients depends on the speed and quality of pre-hospital care and adequate follow-up treatment at specialized intensive care units. High levels of intracranial pressure and low cerebral perfusion pressure values in the early period after brain injury are closely related to mortality of patients within 30 days. Intracranial pressure monitoring may help to avoid problems and allow intervention before they become life-threatening (Tab. 4, Fig. 4, Ref. 23).

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6 +/- 1.4. Plato waves developed in 24 patients (group 1), 74 patients (group 2) did not have plato waves. Median of plato waves in the 1st group was 7[3.5; 7]. They developed on 3rd [2;4.5] day. Maximum level of ICP during plato waves was 47.5 [40;53] mmHg, its duration was 8.5 [7;27] minutes. In the group 1 Prx was significantly lower during first day, than in the group 2. Duration of ICP monitoring was longer in the group I due to presence of plato waves in these patients. CPP did not differ in groups, because CPP was strictly controlled. Patients of the group I had preserved autoregulation and less severe trauma (predominance of closed trauma and Marshall I, II type of brain damage).

The prognostic value of brain extracellular fluid nitric oxide metabolites after traumatic brain injury.,"Tisdall, Martin M; Rejdak, Konrad; Kitchen, Neil D; Smith, Martin; Petzold, Axel","BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a compound with both protective and damaging effects on neurons. Quantification of NO metabolites in humans is limited by sample contamination with blood. In vivo cerebral microdialysis may offer an alternative approach as sampling of extracellular fluid (ECF) adjacent to neurons becomes possible. We investigate the prognostic value of brain ECF NO metabolites in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A prospective case cohort of 195 ECF samples collected from 11 cases over 4 days following TBI was collected. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations ([NO x ]) were quantified using a vanadium-based colorimetric assay., RESULTS: Early ECF [NO x ] (<48 h post TBI) were significantly higher in non-survivors (median 59.2 mumol/l, n = 7) compared to survivors (23.3 mumol/l, n = 4) (P = 0.04). Late (48-96 h) ECF [NO x ] remained higher in non-survivors (47.9 mumol/l) compared to survivors (23.0 mumol/l) but this was not significant (P = 0.29). Receiver operator characteristic analysis shows an optimized cutoff level for ECF [NO x ] of 26.5 mumol/l measured <48 h post TBI for predicting non-survival (sensitivity 100%, specificity 75%)., CONCLUSION: Early ECF NO x concentrations are of prognostic value after TBI.

Limited predictive power of hospitalization variables for long-term cognitive prognosis in adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"de Oliveira Thais, Maria Emilia Rodrigues; Cavallazzi, Gisele; Formolo, Douglas Afonso; de Castro, Lucas D'Avila; Schmoeller, Roseli; Guarnieri, Ricardo; Schwarzbold, Marcelo Liborio; Diaz, Alexandre Paim; Hohl, Alexandre; Prediger, Rui D S; Mader, Maria Joana; Linhares, Marcelo Neves; Staniloiu, Angelica; Markowitsch, Hans J; Walz, Roger","OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a main cause of mortality and morbidity. Association studies between hospitalization variables and cognitive impairment after TBI are frequently retrospective, including non-consecutive patients showing variable degrees of TBI severity, and poor management of missing (drop out) cases., METHODS: We assessed prospectively the demographic and hospitalization variables of 234 consecutive patients with severe TBI (admission Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <=8) and determined their independent association with cognitive performance in a representative sample (n = 46) of surviving patients (n = 172) evaluated 3 (+/-1.8) years after hospitalization., RESULTS: In all, 85% of patients were male and the mean age was 34 (SD +/-13) years. The education level was 9 (+/-4.7) years. As expected, education and age showed a moderately to strong linear relationship with the cognitive performance in 14 of 15 neuropsychological tests (R coefficient = 0.6-0.8). The cognitive test scores were not independently associated with gender, admission GCS, associated trauma, and Marshal CT classification. Admission-elevated blood glucose levels and the presence of sub-arachnoid haemorrhage were independently associated with lower scores on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning retention and Logical Memory-I tests, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: After correction for education and age distribution, the variables that are commonly associated with mortality or Glasgow Outcome Scale including admission pupils' examination, Marshal CT Classification, GCS, and serum glucose showed a limited predictive power for long-term cognitive prognosis. Identification of clinical, radiological, and laboratory variables as well as new biomarkers independently associated with cognitive outcome remains an important challenge for further work involving severe TBI patients.

The potential utility of blood-derived biochemical markers as indicators of early clinical trends following severe traumatic brain injury.,"DeFazio, Michael V; Rammo, Richard A; Robles, Jaime R; Bramlett, Helen M; Dietrich, W Dalton; Bullock, M Ross","OBJECTIVE: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a dynamic neuropathologic process in which a substantial proportion of patients die within the first 48-hours. The assessment of injury severity and prognosis are of primary concern in the initial management of severe TBI. Supplemental testing that aids in the stratification of patients at high risk for deterioration may significantly improve posttraumatic management in the acute setting., METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the utility of both single-marker and multimarker models as predictive indicators of acute clinical status after severe TBI. Forty-four patients who sustained severe TBI (admission Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score <= 8) were divided into two cohorts according to a dichotomized clinical outcome at 72 hours after admission: Poor status (death or GCS score <= 8) and improved status (GCS score improved to >8). Threshold values for clinical status prediction were calculated for serum S-100B, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and plasma D-dimer, upon admission and at 24 hours after TBI by the use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Performance characteristics of these single-marker predictors were compared with those derived from a multimarker logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Biomarkers with the greatest predictive value for poor status at 72 hours included serum S-100B on admission, as well as plasma D-dimer and serum S-100B at 24 hours, for which, associations were strongly significant. Multimarker analysis indicated no substantial improvement in prediction accuracy over the best single predictors during this time frame., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with other clinical, physical, and radiologic evidence, blood-derived biochemical markers may serve to enhance prediction of early clinical trends after severe TBI.

Acute biomarkers of traumatic brain injury: relationship between plasma levels of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein.,"Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Wang, Kevin K W; Papa, Linda; Sorani, Marco D; Yue, John K; Puccio, Ava M; McMahon, Paul J; Inoue, Tomoo; Yuh, Esther L; Lingsma, Hester F; Maas, Andrew I R; Valadka, Alex B; Okonkwo, David O; Manley, Geoffrey T; TRACK-TBI Investigators","Biomarkers are important for accurate diagnosis of complex disorders such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). For a complex and multifaceted condition such as TBI, it is likely that a single biomarker will not reflect the full spectrum of the response of brain tissue to injury. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are among of the most widely studied biomarkers for TBI. Because UCH-L1 and GFAP measure distinct molecular events, we hypothesized that analysis of both biomarkers would be superior to analysis of each alone for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI. Serum levels of UCH-L1 and GFAP were measured in a cohort of 206 patients with TBI enrolled in a multicenter observational study (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury [TRACK-TBI]). Levels of the two biomarkers were weakly correlated to each other (r=0.364). Each biomarker in isolation had good sensitivity and sensitivity for discriminating between TBI patients and healthy controls (area under the curve [AUC] 0.87 and 0.91 for UCH-L1 and GFAP, respectively). When biomarkers were combined, superior sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing TBI was obtained (AUC 0.94). Both biomarkers discriminated between TBI patients with intracranial lesions on CT scan and those without such lesions, but GFAP measures were significantly more sensitive and specific (AUC 0.88 vs. 0.71 for UCH-L1). For association with outcome 3 months after injury, neither biomarker had adequate sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.65-0.74, for GFAP, and 0.59-0.80 for UCH-L1, depending upon Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOS-E] threshold used). Our results support a role for multiple biomarker measurements in TBI research.

Mitochondrial polymorphisms impact outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Conley, Yvette P; Okonkwo, David O; Deslouches, Sandra; Alexander, Sheila; Puccio, Ava M; Beers, Sue R; Ren, Dianxu","Patient outcomes are variable following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the biological underpinnings explaining this variability are unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI is well documented, particularly in animal studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial polymorphisms on mitochondrial function and patient outcomes out to 1 year after a severe TBI in a human adult population. The Human MitoChip V2.0 was used to evaluate mitochondrial variants in an initial set of n=136 subjects. SNPs found to be significantly associated with patient outcomes [Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NRS), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), in-hospital mortality, and hospital length of stay] or neurochemical level (lactate:pyruvate ratio from cerebrospinal fluid) were further evaluated in an expanded sample of n=336 subjects. A10398G was associated with DRS at 6 and 12 months (p=0.02) and a significant time by SNP interaction for DRS was found (p=0.0013). The A10398 allele was associated with greater disability over time. There was a T195C by sex interaction for GOS (p=0.03) with the T195 allele associated with poorer outcomes in females. This is consistent with our findings that the T195 allele was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (p=0.01), but only in females. This is the first study associating mitochondrial DNA variation with both mitochondrial function and neurobehavioral outcomes after TBI in humans. Our findings indicate that mitochondrial DNA variation may impact patient outcomes after a TBI potentially by influencing mitochondrial function, and that sex of the patient may be important in evaluating these associations in future studies.",2014,/,Journal of neurotrauma,31,1,34-41,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.2855,23883111,#7992,Conley 2014,,yes

Can baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability predict late neurological outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury?.,"Henden, Pia Lowhagen; Sondergaard, Soren; Rydenhag, Bertil; Reinsfelt, Bjorn; Ricksten, Sven-Erik; Aneman, Anders","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that depressed heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) are associated with early mortality and morbidity in patients with acute brain injuries of various etiologies. The aim of the present study was to assess changes in HRV and BRS in isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI), with the hypothesis that measurement of autonomic nervous system dysfunction can provide prognostic information on late neurological outcome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with TBI, requiring mechanical ventilation, sedation and analgesia, and with arterial and intracranial pressure monitoring for at least 1 week, were included. Physiological and treatment variables were collected and power spectral analyses of HRV and BRS analyses in time domain were performed daily. HRV in the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) domains, as well as LF/HF ratio and total power, were investigated. The power of these variables to predict poor (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOSE] score <5), late (1 y) neurological outcome was assessed., RESULTS: Total power, LF, HF, and BRS were all significantly depressed in patients with GOSE score <5. This difference could not be explained by a more severe brain injury at admission or more extensive use of sedative or analgesic drugs. The autonomic variables predicted the late neurological outcome with areas under the receiver-operating curves between 0.78 and 0.83 (sensitivity: 0.63 to 0.88 and specificity: 0.73 to 0.82)., CONCLUSIONS: HRV and BRS measures in TBI patients during intensive care treatment, including sedative, analgesic, and vasoactive drugs, may identify patients with poor late neurological outcome.",2014,/,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,26,1,Sep-50,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0b013e3182a47b62,24064714,#7966,Henden 2014,,yes

Patient characteristics, haemoglobin, serum albumin levels at admission and their weekly changes till 21 days were noted along with daily assessment for presence of pressure ulcer. Mortality was assessed at 21 days and neurological outcome at three months through telephonic interview., RESULTS: Of 89 patients studied, pressure ulcer was observed in 6 (7%) and 14 (16%) at the end of two and three weeks, respectively. Pressure ulcer in univariate analysis was significantly associated with poorer GCS (p = 0.05), delayed enteral feeding (p = 0.005) and fall in haemoglobin at two weeks (p = 0.005). Only the latter two were found significant in multivariate analysis. Age, gender, surgical intervention, tracheostomy, prolonged fever and change in albumin had no significant association with pressure ulcer development. Presence of pressure ulcer was significantly associated with mortality at 21 days (p = 0.006) and unfavourable neurological outcome at three months (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The significant factors influencing pressure ulcer development in patients with TBI were delayed enteral feeding and fall in haemoglobin.

Secondary peaks of S100B in serum relate to subsequent radiological pathology in traumatic brain injury.,"Thelin, Eric P; Nelson, David W; Bellander, Bo-Michael","INTRODUCTION: Patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often develop secondary brain lesions that may worsen outcome. S100B, a biomarker of brain damage, has been shown to increase in response to secondary cerebral deterioration. The aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence of secondary increases in serum levels of S100B and their relation to potential subsequent radiological pathology present on CT/MRI-scans., METHODS: Retrospective study from a trauma level 1 hospital, neuro-intensive care unit. 250 patients suffering from TBI were included. Inclusion required a minimum of two radiological examinations and at least three serum samples of S100B, with at least one >48 h after trauma., RESULTS: Secondary pathological findings on CT/MRI, present in 39 % (n = 98) of the patients, were highly correlated to secondary increases of >=0.05 mug/L S100B (P < 0.0001, pseudo-R (2) 0.532). Significance remained also after adjusting for known important TBI predictors. In addition, secondary radiological findings were significantly correlated to outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score, GOS) in uni-(P < 0.0001, pseudo-R (2) 0.111) and multivariate analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting later secondary radiological findings was investigated at three S100B cut-off levels: 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mug/L. A secondary increase of >=0.05 mug/L had higher sensitivity (80 %) but lower specificity (89 %), compared with a secondary increase of >=0.5 mug/L (16 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity), to detect secondary radiological findings., CONCLUSIONS: Secondary increases in serum levels of S100B, even as low as >=0.05 mug/L, beyond 48 h after TBI are strongly correlated to the development of clinically significant secondary radiological findings.",2014,/,Neurocritical care,20,2,217-29,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-013-9916-0,24146416,#7955,Thelin 2014,,yes

This study aimed to determine whether being unemployed or on sick leave before injury influences long-term health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and functioning in patients with severe traumatic brain injury., SUBJECTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients were studied; aged 16-65 years, with severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, from 1999-2002., METHODS: The patients were assessed once, 2-11 years after trauma. Data from the time of injury were combined into a validated prognostic model to adjust for injury severity. Data on sick leave and unemployment before injury were gathered from the Swedish social insurance agency. Outcomes were measured with the Short Form-36 Health Survey, the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, and a self-report questionnaire specifically designed for this study to measure functioning., RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, a history of sick leave/unemployment predicted a worse long-term global outcome, more problems with personal activities of daily living and worse HRQoL., CONCLUSION: These results should be considered when refining outcome predictions and optimizing rehabilitation interventions for patients with severe traumatic brain injury.",2014,/,Brain injury,28,3,328-35,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2013.865274,24354522,#7914,Ulfarsson 2014,,yes
Cerebrospinal fluid cortisol and progesterone profiles and outcomes prognostication after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Santarsieri, Martina; Niyonkuru, Christian; McCullough, Emily H; Dobos, Julie A; Dixon, C Edward; Berga, Sarah L; Wagner, Amy K","Despite significant advances in the management of head trauma, there remains a lack of pharmacological treatment options for traumatic brain injury (TBI). While progesterone clinical trials have shown promise, corticosteroid trials have failed. The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize endogenous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) progesterone and cortisol levels after TBI, (2) determine relationships between CSF and serum profiles, and (3) assess the utility of these hormones as predictors of long-term outcomes. We evaluated 130 adults with severe TBI. Serum samples (n=538) and CSF samples (n=746) were collected for 6 days post-injury, analyzed for cortisol and progesterone, and compared with healthy controls (n=13). Hormone data were linked with clinical data, including Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 6 and 12 months. Group based trajectory (TRAJ) analysis was used to develop temporal hormone profiles delineating distinct subpopulations. Compared with controls, CSF cortisol levels were significantly and persistently elevated during the first week after TBI, and high CSF cortisol levels were associated with poor outcome. As a precursor to cortisol, progesterone mediated these effects. Serum and CSF levels for both cortisol and progesterone were strongly correlated after TBI relative to controls, possibly because of blood-brain barrier disruption. Also, differentially impaired hormone transport and metabolism mechanisms after TBI, potential de novo synthesis of steroids within the brain, and the complex interplay of cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokines may explain these acute hormone profiles and, when taken together, may help shed light on why corticosteroid trials have previously failed and why progesterone treatment after TBI may be beneficial.",2014,/,Journal of neurotrauma,31,8,699-712,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.3177,24354775,#7913,Santarsieri 2014,,yes
Activity of factor VII in patients with isolated blunt traumatic brain injury: association with coagulopathy and progressive hemorrhagic injury.,"Wu, Xing; Du, Zhuoying; Yu, Jian; Sun, Yirui; Pei, Bingbing; Lu, Xin; Tang, Zhengyu; Yin, Mao; Zhou, Liangfu; Hu, Jin","BACKGROUND: Given the importance of factor VII (FVII) in extrinsic pathway of coagulation cascade, we sought to elucidate the relationship between FVII and traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy and progressive hemorrhagic injury (PHI)., METHODS: Eighty-one patients with isolated traumatic brain injury, 16 years or older, were recruited between 2010 and 2012. Blood was collected on arrival in the emergency department and analyzed with activated partial thromboplastic time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and activity of FVII. Coagulopathy was defined as thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 120,000/muL) or elevated international normalized ratio of greater than 1.2 or prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time greater than 40 seconds at admission. PHI was present when the follow-up computed tomographic scan reported any increase in size or number of the hemorrhagic lesions. Logistic regression examined the risks for coagulopathy and PHI., RESULTS: Mean (SD) FVII activity in patients with coagulopathy was 85.69% (34.88%), which was significantly lower than patients without coagulopathy (99.57% [29.37%], p = 0.04). Isolated traumatic brain injury patients with FVII activity less than 77.5% have an odds ratio for coagulopathy of 5.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.82-16.68; p = 0.03) relative to patients with FVII activity of 77.5% or greater. Mean (SD) FVII activity in patients with PHI was 70.76% (18.21%), which was significantly lower than patients without PHI (105.76% [32.27%], p < 0.001).

Acquired coagulopathy of traumatic brain injury defined by routine laboratory tests: which laboratory values matter?.,"Joseph, Bellal; Aziz, Hassan; Zangbar, Bardiya; Kulvatunyou, Narong; Pandit, Viraj; O'Keeffe, Terence; Tang, Andrew; Wynne, Julie; Friese, Randall S; Rhee, Peter","BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy is a major determinant of disability and death in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. However, the correlation between coagulopathy defined by routine coagulation tests and clinical outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not well defined. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of coagulopathy diagnosed by routine laboratory tests on outcomes in TBI patients., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all isolated TBI patients exclusive of prehospital antiplatelet and anticoagulants with coagulation tests, namely, international normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and partial thromboplastin time at admission. We defined coagulopathy by an INR of 1.5 or greater, partial thromboplastin time of 35 or greater, or platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/microL or less. Outcome measures were progression on repeat head computed tomography (RHCT), need for neurosurgical intervention, and mortality., RESULTS: A total of 591 patients were enrolled, with a mean (SD) age of 47.4 (26.5) years and 67% being male. Of the patients, 13.3% were coagulopathic at admission. Platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/microL or less was an independent predictor of progression on RHCT (odd ratio [OR], 4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-10), need for neurosurgical intervention (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-6.1), and mortality (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8). INR was an independent predictor of progression on RHCT (OR, 2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3)., CONCLUSION: Routine bedside coagulation parameters at admission play an important role in predicting outcomes in blunt TBI.

Agitation after traumatic brain injury and predictors of outcome.,"Singh, Rajiv; Venkateshwara, Guru; Nair, Krishnan P S; Khan, Muhammed; Saad, Rafat","OBJECTIVES: To measure the incidence of agitation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an inpatient population and to identify any features associated with an adverse outcome., DESIGN: Prospective study of TBI admissions over 30 months in consecutive admissions with TBI to a regional neurorehabilitation unit. Outcome of agitation was compared to patient, injury and treatment features and any associations were sought. The presence of agitation was measured by the Agitation Behaviour Score. A good outcome for agitation was defined as a return to independent living with minimal care requirement at 6 months using an Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score >4., RESULTS: Over 30 months, there were 146 TBI admissions, of whom 53 cases had agitation (36.3%). Achieving 100% follow-up, 27 (51%) had a good outcome. On a multivariable logistic regression analysis, a good outcome was associated with the type of lesions seen on CT scan, the severity of agitation and the duration of the behaviour.

Prehospital risk factors of mortality and impaired consciousness after severe traumatic brain injury: an epidemiological study.,"Tohme, Sophia; Delhumeau, Cecile; Zuercher, Mathias; Haller, Guy; Walder, Bernhard","BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health concern and a major burden for society. The period between trauma event and hospital admission in an emergency department (ED) could be a determinant for secondary brain injury and early survival. The aim was to investigate the relationship between prehospital factors associated with secondary brain injury (arterial hypotension, hypoxemia, hypothermia) and the outcomes of mortality and impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days., METHODS: A multicenter, prospective cohort study was performed in dedicated trauma centres of Switzerland. Adults with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale score of head region (HAIS) >3) were included. Main outcome measures were death and impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <=13) at 14 days. The associations between risk factors and outcome were assessed with univariate and multivariate regression models., RESULTS: 589 patients were included, median age was 55 years (IQR 33, 70). The median GCS in ED was 4 (IQR 3-14), with abnormal pupil reaction in 167 patients (29.2%). Median ISS was 25 (IQR 21, 34). Three hundred seven patients sustained their TBI from falls (52.1%) and 190 from a road traffic accidents (32.3%). Median time from Out-of-hospital Emergency Medical Service (OHEMS) departure on scene to arrival in ED was 50 minutes (IQR 37-72); 451 patients had a direct admission (76.6%). Prehospital hypotension was observed in 24 (4.1%) patients, hypoxemia in 73 (12.6%) patients and hypothermia in 146 (24.8%). Prehospital hypotension and hypothermia (apart of age and trauma severity) was associated with mortality. Prehospital hypoxemia (apart of trauma severity) was associated with impaired consciousness; indirect admission was a protective factor., CONCLUSION: Mortality and impaired consciousness at 14 days do not have the same prehospital risk factors; prehospital hypotension and hypothermia is associated with mortality, and prehospital hypoxemia with impaired consciousness.",2014,/,"Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",22,101477511,1,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1757-7241-22-1,24393519,#7892,Tohme 2014,,yes
The FOUR score and GCS as predictors of outcome after traumatic brain injury.,"McNett, Molly; Amato, Shelly; Gianakis, Anastasia; Grimm, Dawn; Philippbar, Sue Ann; Belle, Josie; Moran, Cristina","BACKGROUND: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a routine component of a neurological exam for critically ill traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, yet has been criticized for not accurately depicting verbal status among intubated patients or including brain stem reflexes. Preliminary research on the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) Scale suggests it overcomes these limitations. Research is needed to determine correlations with patient outcomes. The aims of this study were to: (1) examine correlations between 24 and 72 h FOUR and GCS scores and functional/cognitive outcomes; (2) determine relationship between 24 and 72 h FOUR scores and mortality., METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Data gathered on adult TBI patients at a Level I trauma center. FOUR scores assigned at 24, 72 h. Functional outcome measured by functional independence measure scores at rehabilitation discharge; cognitive status measured by Weschler Memory Scale scores 3 months post-injury., RESULTS: n = 136. Mean age 53.1. 72 h FOUR and GCS scores correlated with functional outcome (r s = 0.34, p = 0.05; r s = 0.39, p = 0.02), but not cognitive status.

Comparative evaluation of MRS and SPECT in prognostication of patients with mild to moderate head injury.,"Dhandapani, Sivashanmugam; Sharma, Anurag; Sharma, Karamchand; Das, Lakshman","Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have only been individually studied in patients with head injury. This study aimed to comparatively assess both in patients with mild to moderate head injury. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9-14 who underwent MRS and/or SPECT were evaluated in relation to various clinical factors and neurological outcome at 3months. There were 56 SPECT (Tc99m-ethylcysteinate dimer [ECD]) studies and 41 single voxel proton MRS performed in 53 patients, with 41 patients having both. Of the 41 who underwent MRS, 13 had a lower N-acetyl-aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio, 14 had a higher choline (Cho)/Cr ratio, 19 were normal, and nine had bilateral MRS abnormalities. Of the 56 who underwent SPECT, 22 and 19 had severe and moderate hypoperfusion, respectively. Among those in Traumatic Coma Data Bank CT scan category 1 and 2, 50% had MRS abnormalities, whereas 64% had SPECT hypoperfusion, suggesting greater incremental validity of SPECT over MRS. In univariate analyses, GCS, moderate/severe hypoperfusion and bilateral SPECT changes were found to have significant association with unfavorable outcome (odds ratio 13.2, 15.9, and 4.4, and p values <0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively). Patients with lower NAA/Cr ratio in MRS had more unfavorable outcomes, however this was not significant. In multivariate analysis employing binary logistic regression, GCS and severe hypoperfusion on SPECT were noted to have significant association with unfavorable outcome, independent of age, CT scan category, and MRS abnormalities (p values=0.02 and 0.04, respectively). To conclude, ECD-SPECT seems to have greater sensitivity, incremental validity and prognostic value than single voxel proton MRS in select patients with head injury, with only severe hypoperfusion in SPECT significantly associated with unfavorable outcome independent of other confounding factors.

The impact of preinjury anticoagulants and prescription antiplatelet agents on outcomes in older patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Peck, Kimberly A; Calvo, Richard Y; Schechter, Mark S; Sise, C Beth; Kahl, Jessica E; Shackford, Meghan C; Shackford, Steven R; Sise, Michael J; Blaskiewicz, Donald J","BACKGROUND: Anticoagulants and prescription antiplatelet (ACAP) agents widely used by older adults have the potential to adversely affect traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. We hypothesized that TBI patients on preinjury ACAP agents would have worse outcomes than non-ACAP patients., METHODS: This was a 5.5-year retrospective review of patients 55 years and older admitted to a Level I trauma center with blunt force TBI. Patients were categorized as ACAP (warfarin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole/aspirin, enoxaparin, subcutaneous heparin, or multiple agents) or non-ACAP. ACAP patients were further stratified by class of agent (anticoagulant or antiplatelet). Initial and subsequent head computerized tomographic results were examined for type and progression of TBI. Patient preadmission living status and discharge destination were identified. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were progression of initial TBI, development of new intracranial hemorrhage (remote from initial), and the need for an increased level of care at discharge., RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met inclusion criteria: 273 non-ACAP (77%) and 80 ACAP (23%). Upon exclusion of three patients taking a combination of agents, 350 were available for advanced analyses. ACAP status was significantly related to in-hospital mortality. After adjustment for patient and injury characteristics, anticoagulant users were more likely than non-ACAP patients to show progression of initial hemorrhage and develop a new hemorrhagic focus. However, compared with non-ACAP users, antiplatelet users were more likely to die in the hospital. Among survivors to discharge, anticoagulant users were more likely to be discharged to a care facility, but this finding was not robust to adjustment., CONCLUSION: Older TBI patients on preinjury ACAP agents experience a comparatively higher rate of inpatient mortality and other adverse outcomes caused by the effects of antiplatelet agents.

Additional samples were obtained on day 4 and day 7. Results showed that plasma nDNA and mtDNA on admission were significantly increased in patients with TBI compared with controls. Plasma nDNA, but not plasma mtDNA, levels in patients with acute TBI significantly correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and Injury Severity Score (ISS) on presentation. Plasma nDNA increased significantly from day 1 to day 7 in patients with poor outcome. Its levels on presentation were independently associated with outcome and higher levels (cutoff value >72.95 ng/mL) were associated with poorer outcomes.

Longitudinal and prognostic evaluation of mild traumatic brain injury: A 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.,"George, Elijah O; Roys, Steve; Sours, Chandler; Rosenberg, Joseph; Zhuo, Jiachen; Shanmuganathan, Kathirkamanthan; Gullapalli, Rao P","In the majority of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), brain tissue impairment is undetectable by computed tomography and/or structural magnetic resonance imaging. Even in confirmed cases of head injury, conventional neuroimaging methods lack sensitivity in predicting neuropsychological outcomes of patients. The objectives of this study were to (1) cross-sectionally determine deviations in the neurometabolic profile of patients with mTBI from healthy controls at different stages of mTBI using tightly controlled examination windows, and (2) determine associations between acute neurometabolic markers of mTBI and chronic neurocognitive performance. Patients were examined at the early subacute (n=43; 5.44 +/- 3.15 days post-injury (DPI)), late subacute (n=33; 37.00 +/- 12.26 DPI) and chronic (n=27; 195.30 +/- 19.60 DPI) stages of mTBI. Twenty-one neurologically intact subjects were used as controls. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging ((1)H-MRSI) was used to obtain metabolic measurements from different brain regions. The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) was used for cognitive evaluation of patients at the chronic stage of mTBI. Measurements in the thalamus and centrum semiovale (CSV) emerged as the most indicative of injury and were used to predict neurocognitive outcome. The major findings of this study are (1) decreases in Cho/Cre (choline-to-creatine ratio) measured in the thalamus (p=0.042) and CSV (p=0.017) at the late subacute stage of mTBI; (2) positive associations of early subacute Cre measurements in the CSV with chronic ANAM scores measuring performance in delayed (r=0.497, p=0.019) and immediate (r=0.391, p=0.072) code substitution.

Should the neurointensive care management of traumatic brain injury patients be individualized according to autoregulation status and injury subtype?.,"Johnson, Ulf; Lewen, Anders; Ronne-Engstrom, Elisabeth; Howells, Tim; Enblad, Per","INTRODUCTION: The status of autoregulation is an important prognostic factor in traumatic brain injury (TBI), and is important to consider in the management of TBI patients. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) is a measure of autoregulation that has been thoroughly studied, but little is known about its variation in different subtypes of TBI. In this study, we examined the impact of PRx and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) on outcome in different TBI subtypes., METHODS: 107 patients were retrospectively studied. Data on PRx, CPP, and outcome were collected from our database. The first CT scan was classified according to the Marshall classification system. Patients were assigned to ""diffuse"" (Marshall class: diffuse-1, diffuse-2, and diffuse-3) or ""focal"" (Marshall class: diffuse-4, evacuated mass lesion, and non-evacuated mass lesion) groups. 2 x 2 tables were constructed calculating the proportions of favorable/unfavorable outcome at different combinations of PRx and CPP., RESULTS: Low PRx was significantly associated with favorable outcome in the combined group (p = 0.002) and the diffuse group (p = 0.04), but not in the focal group (p = 0.06). In the focal group higher CPP values were associated with worse outcome (p = 0.02). In diffuse injury patients with disturbed autoregulation (PRx >0.1), CPP >70 mmHg was associated with better outcome (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: TBI patients with diffuse injury may differ from those with mass lesions. In the latter higher levels of CPP may be harmful, possibly due to BBB disruption. In TBI patients with diffuse injury and disturbed autoregulation higher levels of CPP may be beneficial.",2014,/,Neurocritical care,21,2,259-65,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-014-9954-2,24515639,#7851,Johnson 2014,,yes

Sustained elevated ICP significantly increased all in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.15 [1.11, 8.91], P = .031) and death because of cerebral herniation (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 9.25 [1.19, 10.48], P = .035). Decreased CPP had no impact on mortality., CONCLUSIONS: A single episode of sustained increased ICP is an accurate predictor of poor outcomes. Decreased CPP did not affect survival.

External validation of the CRASH and IMPACT prognostic models in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Han, Julian; King, Nicolas K K; Neilson, Sam J; Gandhi, Mihir P; Ng, Ivan","An accurate prognostic model is extremely important in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) for both patient management and research. Clinical prediction models must be validated both internally and externally before they are considered widely applicable. Our aim is to independently externally validate two prediction models, one developed by the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head injury (CRASH) trial investigators, and the other from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) group. We used a cohort of 300 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] <=8) consecutively admitted to the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), Singapore, between February 2006 and December 2009. The CRASH models (base and CT) predict 14 day mortality and 6 month unfavorable outcome. The IMPACT models (core, extended, and laboratory) estimate 6 month mortality and unfavorable outcome. Validation was based on measures of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test and Cox calibration regression analysis. In the NNI database, the overall observed 14 day mortality was 47.7%, and the observed 6 month unfavorable outcome was 71.0%. The CRASH base model and all three IMPACT models gave an underestimate of the observed values in our cohort when used to predict outcome. Using the CRASH CT model, the predicted 14 day mortality of 46.6% approximated the observed outcome, whereas the predicted 6 month unfavorable outcome was an overestimate at 74.8%. Overall, both the CRASH and IMPACT models showed good discrimination, with AUCs ranging from 0.80 to 0.89, and good overall calibration. We conclude that both the CRASH and IMPACT models satisfactorily predicted outcome in our patients with severe TBI.",2014,/,Journal of neurotrauma,31,13,1146-52,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.3003,24568201,#7829,Han 2014,,yes
Prognostic value of somatosensory-evoked potentials and CT scan evaluation in acute traumatic brain injury.,"Bosco, Enrico; Zanatta, Paolo; Ponzin, Diego; Marton, Elisabetta; Feletti, Alberto; Scarpa, Bruno; Longatti, Pierluigi; Paolin, Adolfo","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to assess whether a complete analysis of all early cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) components and computed tomography (CT) scan features can provide a better prognostic measure than the early cortical component N20/P25 alone, in patients with severe head injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 81 consecutive patients admitted to intensive care unit with diagnosis of severe head injury. All patients underwent neurophysiological assessment with SEPs and electroencephalography within the first 6 days after trauma. The marginal effect of each variable on Glasgow Outcome Scale score was evaluated by using univariate measures of association. We fit a cumulative logit model by maximum likelihood, and the partial effect of each variable was assessed by likelihood ratio test. We performed variable selection by forward stepwise, according to the Akaike information criterion., RESULTS: Our final cumulative logit model including SEPs primary complex (pN20/fP20/cP22), SEPs middle latency (N30/P45/N60), and CT scan hypodensity values showed a significantly increased predictive power of Glasgow Outcome Scale, compared with pN20 alone (P<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant (P<0.0001) improvement in outcome prediction when the model includes a pool of amplitudes and latencies referred to different early-evoked components pN20, pP25, fP20, cP22, N30, P45, and N60, associated to CT scan hypodensity values, compared with the use of the cortical parietal N20/P25 alone.",2014,/,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,26,4,299-305,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0000000000000040,24577428,#7825,Bosco 2014,,yes

We included published, peer-reviewed studies with more than 30 adult cases., STUDY SELECTION: Controlled trials and cohort and case-control studies were selected according to predefined criteria. Studies had to assess subjective, self-reported outcomes. After 77,914 titles and abstracts were screened, 299 articles were eligible and reviewed for scientific quality. This includes 3 original International Collaboration on MTBI Prognosis (ICoMP) research studies., DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies were critically appraised using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Two reviewers independently reviewed each study and tabled data from accepted articles. A third reviewer was consulted for disagreements., DATA SYNTHESIS: Evidence from accepted studies was synthesized qualitatively into key findings, and prognostic information was prioritized according to design as exploratory or confirmatory. Of 299 reviewed studies, 101 (34%) were accepted and form our evidence base of prognostic studies. Of these, 23 addressed self-reported outcomes in adults, including 2 of the 3 original ICoMP research studies. These studies show that common postconcussion symptoms are not specific to MTBI/concussion and occur after other injuries as well. Poor recovery after MTBI is associated with poorer premorbid mental and physical health status and with more injury-related stress. Most recover over 1 year, but persistent symptoms are more likely in those with more acute symptoms and more emotional stress., CONCLUSIONS: Common subjective symptoms after MTBI are not necessarily caused by brain injury per se, but they can be persistent in some patients. Those with more initial complaints and psychological distress recover slower. We need more high-quality research on these issues. Copyright Â© 2014 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Ventricular CSF was sampled within 24-h of injury and analyzed for seven candidate biomarkers (UCH-L1, MAP-2, SBDP150, SBDP145, SBDP120, MBP, and S100B). The International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) scores (Core, Extended, and Lab) were calculated for each patient to determine risk of 6-months mortality.

Association between serum malondialdehyde levels and mortality in patients with severe brain trauma injury.,"Lorente, Leonardo; Martin, Maria M; Abreu-Gonzalez, Pedro; Ramos, Luis; Argueso, Monica; Caceres, Juan J; Sole-Violan, Jordi; Lorenzo, Jose M; Molina, Ismael; Jimenez, Alejandro","There is a hyperoxidative state in patients with trauma brain injury (TBI). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an end-product formed during oxidative stress, concretely lipid peroxidation. In small studies (highest sample size 50 patients), higher levels of MDA have been found in nonsurviving than surviving patients with TBI. An association between serum MDA levels and mortality in patients with TBI, however, has not been reported. Thus, the objective of this prospective, observational, multicenter study, performed in six Spanish intensive care units, was to determine whether MDA serum levels are associated with early mortality in a large series of patients with severe TBI. Serum MDA levels were measured in 100 patients with severe TBI on day 1 and in 75 healthy controls. The end-point of the study was 30-day mortality. We found higher serum MDA levels in patients with severe TBI than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Nonsurviving patients with TBI (n = 27) showed higher serum MDA levels (p < 0.001) than survivors (n = 73). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 4.662; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.466-14.824; p = 0.01), controlling for Glasgow Coma Score, age, and computed tomography findings. Survival analysis showed that patients with serum MDA levels higher than 1.96 nmol/mL presented increased 30-day mortality than patients with lower levels (hazard ratio = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.43-8.47; p < 0.001).

"Variation in the BDNF gene interacts with age to predict mortality in a prospective, longitudinal cohort with severe TBI.","Failla, Michelle D; Kumar, Raj G; Peitzman, Andrew B; Conley, Yvette P; Ferrell, Robert E; Wagner, Amy K","BACKGROUND: Mortality predictions following traumatic brain injury (TBI), and our understanding of TBI pathology, may be improved by including genetic risk in addition to traditional prognostic variables. One promising target is the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a ubiquitous neurotrophin important for neuronal survival and neurogenesis., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized the addition of BDNF genetic variation would improve mortality prediction models and that BDNF Met-carriers (rs6265) and C-carriers (rs7124442) would have the highest mortality rates post-TBI., METHODS: This study examined BDNF functional single nucleotide polymorphisms rs6265 (val66met) and rs7124442 (T>C) in relation to mortality in a prospective, longitudinal cohort with severe TBI. We examined 315 individuals receiving care for a closed head injury within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, aged 16 to 74 years. Mortality was examined acutely (0-7 days postinjury) and postacutely (8-365 days postinjury). A gene risk score (GRS) was developed to examine both BDNF loci. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios for survivability post-TBI while controlling for covariates., RESULTS: BDNF GRS was significantly associated with acute mortality, regardless of age. Interestingly, subjects in the hypothesized no-risk allele group had the lowest survival probability. Postacutely, BDNF-GRS interacted with age such that younger participants in the no-risk group had the highest survival probability, while older participants in the hypothesized no-risk group had the lowest probability of survival., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest complex relationships between BDNF and TBI mortality that interact with age to influence survival predictions beyond clinical variables alone. Evidence supporting dynamic, temporal balances of pro-survival/pro-apoptotic target receptors may explain injury and age-related gene associations.

Prevalence of severe hypokalaemia in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Wu, Xing; Lu, Xin; Lu, Xiangqiong; Yu, Jian; Sun, Yirui; Du, Zhuoying; Wu, Xuehai; Mao, Ying; Zhou, Liangfu; Wu, Sirong; Hu, Jin","INTRODUCTION: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are more vulnerable to develop hypokalaemia, we sought to investigate the prevalence, and the relationship between severe hypokalaemia and the mortality of traumatic brain injury patients., METHODS: Isolated traumatic brain patients who had hypokalaemia (serum potassium <3.5mmol/L) and age>=14yrs were recruited into the study between January 2008 and March 2013. Hypokalaemia was defined as potassium level in the blood <3.5mmol/L during the hospitalisation, which was classified by severity: mild (3.0mmol/L<=K<3.5mmol/L), moderate (2.5mmol/L<=K<3.0mmol/L) and severe (K<2.5mmol/L). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to find the impact of hypokalaemia on mortality., RESULTS: A total 375 cases were included in analysis. The peak incidence of severe hypokalaemia occurred in the first 24-96h. TBI patients with severe hypokalaemia had significantly higher serum sodium and lower serum phosphorus than those patients with mild or moderate hypokalaemia (p<0.001). Compare to other groups, the severe hypokalaemia group had the worst outcome. Moreover, the patients (n=15) who had severe hypokalaemia, hypernatraemia (Na>160mmol/L), and hypophosphataemia (P<0.3mmol/L) all died in hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis resulted in decrease of GCS (OR=1.27; 95% CI=1.15-1.41; p<0.001) and potassium (OR=4.35; 95% CI=2.04-9.26; p<0.001) being associated with significant increased risk of mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The peak incidence of severe hypokalaemia occurred in the first 24-96h. TBI patients with severe hypokalaemia are more vulnerable to develop hypophosphataemia and hypernatraemia than patients with mild and moderate hypokalaemia.

Variable neuroendocrine-immune dysfunction in individuals with unfavorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Santarsieri, M; Kumar, R G; Kochanek, P M; Berga, S; Wagner, A K","Bidirectional communication between the immune and neuroendocrine systems is not well understood in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to characterize relationships between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cortisol and inflammation after TBI, and to determine how these relationships differ by outcome. CSF samples were collected from 91 subjects with severe TBI during days 0-6 post-injury, analyzed for cortisol and inflammatory markers, and compared to healthy controls (n=13 cortisol, n=11 inflammatory markers). Group-based trajectory analysis (TRAJ) delineated subpopulations with similar longitudinal CSF cortisol profiles (high vs. low cortisol). Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 6months served as the primary outcome measure reflecting global outcome. Inflammatory markers that displayed significant bivariate associations with both GOS and cortisol TRAJ (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, soluble Fas [sFas], soluble intracellular adhesion molecule [sICAM]-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF]-alpha) were used to generate a cumulative inflammatory load score (ILS). Subsequent analysis revealed that cortisol TRAJ group membership mediated ILS effects on outcome (indirect effect estimate=-0.253, 95% CI (-0.481, -0.025), p=0.03). Correlational analysis between mean cortisol levels and ILS were examined separately within each cortisol TRAJ group and by outcome. Within the low cortisol TRAJ group, subjects with unfavorable 6-month outcome displayed a negative correlation between ILS and mean cortisol (r=-0.562, p=0.045). Conversely, subjects with unfavorable outcome in the high cortisol TRAJ group displayed a positive correlation between ILS and mean cortisol (r=0.391, p=0.006). Our results suggest that unfavorable outcome after TBI may result from dysfunctional neuroendocrine-immune communication wherein an adequate immune response is not mounted or, alternatively, neuroinflammation is prolonged. Importantly, the nature of neuroendocrine-immune dysfunction differs between cortisol TRAJ groups. These results present a novel biomarker-based index from which to discriminate outcome and emphasize the need for evaluating tailored treatments targeting inflammation early after injury.

Systematic review of multivariable prognostic models for mild traumatic brain injury.,"Silverberg, Noah D; Gardner, Andrew J; Brubacher, Jeffrey R; Panenka, William J; Li, Jun Jian; Iverson, Grant L","Prognostic models can guide clinical management and increase statistical power in clinical trials. The availability and adequacy of prognostic models for mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is uncertain. The present study aimed to (1) identify and evaluate multivariable prognostic models for MTBI, and (2) determine which pre-, peri-, and early post-injury variables have independent prognostic value in the context of multivariable models. An electronic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for English-language MTBI cohort studies from 1970-2013 was supplemented by Web of Science citation and hand searching. This search strategy identified 7789 articles after removing duplicates. Of 182 full-text articles reviewed, 26 met eligibility criteria including (1) prospective inception cohort design, (2) prognostic information collected within 1 month post-injury, and (3) 2+variables combined to predict clinical outcome (e.g., post-concussion syndrome) at least 1 month later. Independent reviewers extracted sample characteristics, study design features, clinical outcome variables, predictor selection methods, and prognostic model discrimination, calibration, and cross-validation. These data elements were synthesized qualitatively. The present review found no multivariable prognostic model that adequately predicts individual patient outcomes from MTBI. Suboptimal methodology limits their reproducibility and clinical usefulness. The most robust prognostic factors in the context of multivariable models were pre-injury mental health and early post-injury neuropsychological functioning. Women and adults with early post-injury anxiety also have worse prognoses. Relative to these factors, the severity of MTBI had little long-term prognostic value.

Glasgow coma scale motor score and pupillary reaction to predict six-month mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury: comparison of field and admission assessment.,"Majdan, Marek; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Nieboer, Daan; Mauritz, Walter; Rusnak, Martin; Lingsma, Hester F","The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and pupillary reactivity are well-known prognostic factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to compare the GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity assessed in the field and at hospital admission and assess their prognostic value for 6-month mortality in patients with moderate or severe TBI. We studied 445 patients with moderate or severe TBI from Austria enrolled to hospital in 2009-2012. The area under the curve (AUC) and Nagelkerke's R(2) were used to evaluate the predictive ability of GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity assessed in the field and at admission. Uni- and multi-variable analyses-adjusting for age, other clinical, and computed tomography findings-were performed using combinations of field and admission GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity. Motor scores generally deteriorated from the field to admission, whereas pupillary reactivity was similar. GCS motor score assessed in field (AUC=0.754; R(2)=0.273) and pupillary assessment at admission (AUC=0.662; R(2)=0.214) performed best as predictors of 6-month mortality in the univariate analysis. This combination also showed best performance in the adjusted analyses (AUC=0.876; R(2)=0.508), but the performance of both predictors assessed at admission was not much worse (AUC=0.857; R(2)=0.460). Field GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity at hospital admission, compared to other combinations of these parameters, possess the best prognostic value to predict 6-month mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Given that differences in prognostic performance are only small, both the field and admission values of GCS motor score and pupillary reaction may be reasonable to use in multi-variable prediction models to predict 6-month outcome.",2015,/,Journal of neurotrauma,32,2,101-8,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2014.3438,25227136,#7427,Majdan 2015,,yes
Improved sensitivity of 3.0 Tesla susceptibility-weighted imaging in detecting traumatic bleeds and its use in predicting outcomes in patients with mild traumatic brain injury.,"Liu, Guobing; Ghimire, Prasanna; Pang, Haopeng; Wu, Guangyao; Shi, Hongcheng","BACKGROUND: The efficacy of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for detecting intracranial bleeds (ICBs) in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) has not been directly compared to that of T2*-weighted gradient-recalled-echo imaging (T2*WI). Further, its prognostic value for MTBI patients remains unproven., PURPOSE: To compare the sensitivity of ICB identification between SWI and T2*WI and examine the prognostic value of SWI for MTBI patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: T2*WI, SWI, and clinical information of 63 MTBI patients were collected. Sensitivity was compared between T2*WI and SWI for ICB identification, and statistical analysis was conducted to understand the correlations between SWI and clinical characteristics., RESULTS: ICBs were detected in more patients (47 vs. 35, P < 0.001) and more ICBs were detected (276 vs. 147, P < 0.001) on SWI than T2*WI. On SWI, patients with conscious disturbance showed higher ICBs prevalence (84.6% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.020), and more patients from the post-concussive syndrome (PCS)(+) group than the PCS(-)group were ICBs positive (86.1% vs. 59.3%, P = 0.015). The numbers of ICBs were significantly higher in the PCS(+) group than the PCS(-) group (P < 0.001). Significant correlation was found between PCS and ICBs number (r = 0.510, P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ICB number was an independent variable predicting occurrence of PCS., CONCLUSION: SWI is more sensitive than T2*WI in detecting hemorrhagic foci in MTBI patients and may offer valuable prognostic information regarding these patients, for example, information on PCS. Further, cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage may affect long-term outcomes in MTBI patients.

Distribution and characteristics of severe traumatic brain injury at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda.,"Tran, Tu M; Fuller, Anthony T; Kiryabwire, Joel; Mukasa, John; Muhumuza, Michael; Ssenyojo, Hussein; Haglund, Michael M","OBJECTIVE: Road traffic accidents are a leading cause of injury in low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates are disproportionately higher. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) tend to have very poor outcomes. To reduce the burden from severe TBI, we describe its distribution at Mulago National Referral Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) and identify the associations between outcomes and patient characteristics, offering insights into prevention and future research efforts to improve clinical care., METHODS: This is a single-institution, retrospective chart review including patients of all ages with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less (measured upon admission).

Descriptive statistics and univariable and multivariable regression models were fitted to identify significant associations with outcome (died or discharged)., RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients were identified between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2009. The cumulative incidence of admissions is 89 per 100,000. Thirty-one patients died in the hospital, yielding a 25.8% mortality rate. Motorcycle road traffic accident was the leading mechanism of injury, and males ages 15-29 years comprised the predominant demographic (42.5% of patients). Initial GCS, change in GCS score during hospital stay, and the presence of hematoma were strongest predictors of outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was a common condition for injury-related hospital admissions at Mulago Hospital. The capacity for neurosurgery may have explained the relatively lower mortality rate than previously reported from Sub-Saharan Africa. Further investigations are needed. Targeted prevention programs focused on motorcycle users and helmet law enforcement should decrease the incidence of severe TBI. Copyright Â© 2015.

"Acute CSF interleukin-6 trajectories after TBI: associations with neuroinflammation, polytrauma, and outcome.","Kumar, R G; Diamond, M L; Boles, J A; Berger, R P; Tisherman, S A; Kochanek, P M; Wagner, A K","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a significant inflammatory burden that perpetuates the production of inflammatory mediators and biomarkers. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to be elevated after trauma, and a major contributor to the inflammatory response following TBI. Previous studies have investigated associations between IL-6 and outcome following TBI, but to date, studies have been inconsistent in their conclusions. We hypothesized that cohort heterogeneity, temporal inflammatory profiles, and concurrent inflammatory marker associations are critical to characterize when targeting subpopulations for anti-inflammatory therapies. Toward this objective, we used serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to generate temporal acute IL-6 trajectory (TRAJ) profiles in a prospective cohort of adults with severe TBI (n=114). We examined the impact of injury type on IL-6 profiles, and how IL-6 profiles impact sub-acute (2weeks-3months) serum inflammatory marker load and long-term global outcome 6-12months post-injury. There were two distinct acute CSF IL-6 profiles, a high and low TRAJ group. Individuals in the high TRAJ had increased odds of unfavorable Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 6months (adjusted OR=3.436, 95% CI: 1.259, 9.380). Individuals in the high TRAJ also had higher mean acute CSF inflammatory load compared to individuals in the low TRAJ (p0.05). The two groups did not differ with respect acute serum profiles; however, individuals in the high CSF IL-6 TRAJ also had higher mean sub-acute serum IL-1beta and IL-6 levels compared with the low TRAJ group (p0.05). Lastly, injury type (isolated TBI vs. TBI+polytrauma) was associated with IL-6 TRAJ group (chi(2)=5.31, p=0.02). Specifically, there was 70% concordance between those with TBI+polytrauma and the low TRAJ; in contrast, isolated TBI was similarly distributed between TRAJ groups. These data provide evidence that sustained, elevated levels of CSF IL-6 are associated with an increased inflammatory load, and these increases are associated with increased odds for unfavorable global outcomes in the first year following TBI. Future studies should explore additional factors contributing to IL-6 elevations, and therapies to mitigate its detrimental effects on outcome. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Identifying posttraumatic amnesia in individuals with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Meares, Susanne; Shores, E Arthur; Smyth, Tracy; Batchelor, Jennifer; Murphy, Margaret; Vukasovic, Matthew","OBJECTIVE: To examine the utility of the Abbreviated Westmead Post-traumatic Amnesia Scale, which includes the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and 3 picture cards used to measure amnesia, in identifying the presence or absence of posttraumatic amnesia in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)., DESIGN: Prospective study using data from the Abbreviated Westmead Post-traumatic Amnesia Scale., SETTING: Trauma hospital., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with possible mTBI who presented between April and September 2011 (N=252; age range, 18-65y; mean age, 37.4+/-13.9y; 77% men)., INTERVENTION: Administration of the Abbreviated Westmead Post-traumatic Amnesia Scale., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GCS and Abbreviated Westmead Post-traumatic Amnesia Scale pass/fail rates., RESULTS: Of the individuals, 169 (mean age, 35.1+/-13.6y; 77% men) received the scale. A pass/fail performance was achieved a median 121 minutes (interquartile range, 89-205min) after triage. Of the 45 who failed, 31 (69%) had a GCS score of 15. The likelihood of failing was associated with being older (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.06; P<.05), having consumed alcohol (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.42-6.74; P<.01), and the scale being administered closer to the time of the injury (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P<.05). Nineteen (42%) of those who failed had consumed alcohol, 11 had a GCS score of 15, and 8 had a GCS score of 14., CONCLUSIONS: A GCS score of 15 does not always signify return to normative cognitive function. Individuals with a GCS score of 15 who are acutely cognitively impaired are at risk of not being accurately identified. The addition of an amnesia score to the GCS in the Abbreviated Westmead Post-traumatic Amnesia Scale will assist in making a diagnosis of mTBI.

Predicting long-term outcome after traumatic brain injury using repeated measurements of Glasgow Coma Scale and data mining methods.,"Lu, Hsueh-Yi; Li, Tzu-Chi; Tu, Yong-Kwang; Tsai, Jui-Chang; Lai, Hong-Shiee; Kuo, Lu-Ting","Previous studies have identified some clinical parameters for predicting long-term functional recovery and mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, data mining methods were combined with serial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and clinical and laboratory parameters to predict 6-month functional outcome and mortality in patients with TBI. Data of consecutive adult patients presenting at a trauma center with moderate-to-severe head injury were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical parameters including serial GCS measurements at emergency department, 7th day, and 14th day and laboratory data were included for analysis (n = 115). We employed artificial neural network (ANN), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, and logistic regression to predict mortality and functional outcomes at 6 months after TBI. Favorable functional outcome was achieved by 34.8% of the patients, and overall 6-month mortality was 25.2%. For 6-month functional outcome prediction, ANN was the best model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 96.13%, sensitivity of 83.50%, and specificity of 89.73%. The best predictive model for mortality was NB with AUC of 91.14%, sensitivity of 81.17%, and specificity of 90.65%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated GCS measurements on the 7th and 14th day and difference between emergency room and 14th day GCS score as the most influential attributes both in mortality and functional outcome prediction models.

Outcomes in traumatic brain injury for patients presenting on antiplatelet therapy.,"Cull, John David; Sakai, Lauren M; Sabir, Imran; Johnson, Brent; Tully, Andrew; Nagy, Kimberly; Dennis, Andrew; Starr, Frederic L; Joseph, Kimberly; Wiley, Dorion; Moore, Henry R 3rd; Oliphant, Uretz J; Bokhari, Faran","An increasing number of patients are presenting to trauma units with head injuries on antiplatelet therapy (APT). The influence of APT on these patients is poorly defined. This study examines the outcomes of patients on APT presenting to the hospital with blunt head trauma (BHT). Registries of two Level I trauma centers were reviewed for patients older than 40 years of age from January 2008 to December 2011 with BHT. Patients on APT were compared with control subjects. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and need for neurosurgical intervention (NI). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was a secondary outcome measure. Multivariate analysis was used and adjusted models included antiplatelet status, age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Glasgow coma scale (GCS). Patients meeting inclusion criteria and having complete data (n = 1547) were included in the analysis; 422 (27%) patients were taking APT. Rates of ICH, NI, and in-hospital mortality of patients with BHT in our study were 45.4, 3.1, and 5.8 per cent, respectively. Controlling for age, ISS, and GCS, there was no significant difference in ICH (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1.16), NI (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.60 to 2.67), or mortality (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.89 to 3.59) associated with APT. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with ISS 20 or greater on APT had increased in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.03 to 5.31). LOS greater than 14 days was more likely in the APT group than those in the non-APT group (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.12).

Side of pupillary mydriasis predicts the cognitive prognosis in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"DE Souza, R L; Thais, M E; Cavallazzi, G; Paim Diaz, A; Schwarzbold, M L; Nau, A L; Rodrigues, G M; Souza, D S; Hohl, A; Walz, R","BACKGROUND: Pupils' abnormalities are associated to bad prognosis in traumatic brain injury. We investigated the association between the side of pupil mydriasis and the long-term cognitive performance of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: We analyzed the cognitive performance of patients admitted at the intensive care unit with isochoric pupils (IP, n = 28), left mydriasis (LM, n = 10), right mydriasis (RM, n = 9) evaluated in mean 2.5 years after the severe TBI and controls (n = 26) matched for age, sex and education level., RESULTS: Patients and controls had similar scores in the four WAIS-III investigated subtests. In comparison with controls, LM patients had lower scores in Letters and Category Fluency and IP patients in Category Fluency. Among the 10 evaluated memory tests, LM patients had lower scores than controls in eight, RM patients in two and IP in three memory tests. IP and RM were 3.5 to nine times more associated to significant impairment (cognitive scores under the percentile 10 of controls) in six of 16 investigated cognitive tests. LM was six to 15 times more associated to significant impairment in 10 of 16 cognitive tests. The association among the pupil abnormalities and cognitive performances remained significant after the multiple linear regression analysis controlling for age, gender, admission coma Glasgow scale and serum glucose, presence of associated trauma, and cranial computed tomography abnormalities., CONCLUSION: Side of admission pupil abnormalities may be a useful variable to improve prognostic models for long-term cognitive performance in severe TBI patients.

Mortality following Traumatic Brain Injury Inpatient Rehabilitation.,"Spitz, Gershon; Downing, Marina G; McKenzie, Dean; Ponsford, Jennie L","The aim of this study was to examine the rate and causes of mortality following mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation and to develop a multivariate prognostic model of mortality. We conducted a cohort study of 3341 individuals with mild to severe TBI followed-up from a post-acute inpatient rehabilitation center. Rate of death and survival between one and 26 years following injury were examined using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and prognostic models developed using Cox regression. A mortality rate of 9.3% was observed and an overall SMR of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.05). A statistically significant elevated SMR of 1.20 (95% CI=1.06-1.37) was observed for males, and both males and females had an elevated risk of death from external causes. Females also were found to have a significantly elevated SMR of 5.02 (95% CI=1.36-12.80) for intentional self-harm. Individuals ages 15-44 had a two-fold increase in mortality, compared with the general population. The multivariate Cox model indicated that increased risk of mortality was associated with older age, being male, being unemployed prior to injury, having a history of stroke, alcohol use, mental health issues, and back injury sustained in the accident. Premorbid lifestyle factors exerted a greater influence on mortality following TBI, compared with injury-related factors. This risk was especially prominent for younger individuals, who died primarily due to external causes. These findings highlight the need for interventions that address premorbid issues, such as substance abuse and mental health issues.",2015,/,Journal of neurotrauma,32,16,1272-80,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2014.3814,25706104,#7315,Spitz 2015,,yes
Acute Traumatic Brain Injury: Mortality in the Elderly.,"Herou, Erik; Romner, Bertil; Tomasevic, Gregor","OBJECTIVE: Despite recent progress, prognosis for the elderly (defined as aged >=70 years) afflicted by traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unfavorable and surgical intervention remains controversial. Research during the past decade on the mortality rates or prognostic factors for survival in the elderly is limited., METHODS: We analyzed 97 patients aged >=70 years who were treated surgically for closed TBI at our neurosurgical unit between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2012. In addition, we analyzed 22 patients aged >=70 years who had sustained a closed TBI and on whom no neurosurgical intervention was performed. Outcome in both groups was measured as 30-, 90- and 180-day mortality., RESULTS: Surgically treated patients: median age, 76 years' 30-day overall mortality rate, 36%. Higher mortality was seen with lower level of consciousness, high energy trauma, one pupil fixed and dilated, and more extensive intracranial pathology. Presence of warfarin, more advanced age, or degree of midline shift were not associated with worsened outcome. Patients not treated neurosurgically: median age. 81.5 years; 30-day overall mortality rate, 23%. Mortality for patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 10-15 was 6%, GCS 6-9 67%, and GCS 3-5 100%., CONCLUSIONS: Selected patients aged >=70 years can benefit from surgical intervention for closed TBI. Level of consciousness, radiologic type of injury, mechanism of injury, and pupil abnormalities should be carefully evaluated. There also seems to exist a group of patients in whom surgical intervention offers little benefit, as mortality rate is low without surgical intervention. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a common complication in TBI. Limited information exists regarding the significance of infectious complications on long-term outcomes after TBI. We sought to characterize risks associated with HAP on outcomes 5 years after TBI., METHODS: This study involved data from the merger of an institutional trauma registry and the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems outcome data. Individuals with severe head injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score >= 4) who survived to rehabilitation were analyzed. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) at 1, 2, and 5 years. GOSE was dichotomized into low (GOSE score < 6) and high (GOSE score >= 6). Logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds of low GOSE score associated with HAP after controlling for age, sex, head and overall injury severity, cranial surgery, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ventilation days, and other important confounders. A general estimating equation model was used to analyze all outcome observations simultaneously while controlling for within-patient correlation., RESULTS: A total of 141 individuals met inclusion criteria, with a 30% incidence of HAP. Individuals with and without HAP had similar demographic profiles, presenting vitals, head injury severity, and prevalence of cranial surgery. Individuals with HAP had lower presenting GCS score. Logistic regression demonstrated that HAP was independently associated with low GOSE scores at follow-up (1 year: odds ratio [OR], 6.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-23.14; p = 0.005) (2 years: OR, 7.30; 95% CI, 1.87-27.89; p = 0.004) (5-years: OR, 6.89; 95% CI, 1.42-33.39; p = 0.017). Stratifying by GCS score of 8 or lower and early intubation, HAP remained a significant independent predictor of low GOSE score in all strata. In the general estimating equation model, HAP continued to be an independent predictor of low GOSE score (OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.82-11.60; p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: HAP is independently associated with poor outcomes in severe TBI extending 5 years after injury.

The protein cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), present in epithelial cells, is cleaved by the action of caspases during apoptosis, and the resulting fragments are released into the blood as caspase-cleaved CK (CCCK)-18. Circulating levels of CCCK-18, as biomarker of apoptosis, have been determined in patients with different processes; however, it has not been explored in TBI patients. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between serum CCCK-18 levels and mortality and whether such levels could be used as a biomarker to predict outcomes in TBI patients., METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicenter study carried out in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. We included patients with severe TBI defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lower than 9; and were excluded those patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) in non-cranial aspects higher than 9. We measured serum CCCK-18 levels at admission.

Genetic Variation of ApoE Gene in Ethnic Kashmiri Population and Its Association with Outcome After Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Yousuf, Adfar; Khursheed, Nayil; Rasool, Ishrat; Kundal, Vijay; Jeelani, Humira; Afroze, Dil","The outcome from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is variable and only partly explained by known prognostic factors. Genetic factors may influence the brain's susceptibility to injury or capacity for repair and regeneration. ApoE has been implicated in modifying neurological outcome after TBI, although the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly defined. Apolipoprotein E is an apparently multifunctional protein involved in the response of the brain to injury and in subsequent repair processes. Several studies have shown that patients with APOE e4 have a poorer outcome after TBI. This study was aimed to analyse the genotypes of ApoE in Kashmiri population and to examine the association of APOE genotype with outcome after TBI. A total of 450 subjects (300 healthy controls and 150 TBI patients) were recruited for the study. Genotyping was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Our study indicated Apoe3/e3 to be the most common genotype in this study group. The allele frequency of the Apo E gene in these study subjects was observed to be 0.07 for the e2 allele, 0.82 for the e3 allele and 0.11 for the e4 allele. However, no association between the presence of APOe4 allele and outcome after head injury was observed in this study [p = 0.92].

Persistent Sleep Disturbances Independently Predict Poorer Functional and Social Outcomes 1 Year After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Chan, Lai Gwen; Feinstein, Anthony","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sleep disturbances on functional and social outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury., SETTING: Outpatient traumatic brain injury clinic in a tertiary trauma center., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 374 mild traumatic brain injury patients were assessed within 3 months of injury and followed up every 3 months for 1 year., DESIGN: Analysis of a historical cohort in a naturalistic clinical setting., MAIN MEASURES: At each visit, symptoms of concussion and psychological distress and indices of functional and social outcomes were measured with the Rivermead Postconcussion Questionnaire, 28-item General Health Questionnaire, and Rivermead Head Injury Follow-up Questionnaire, respectively. Changes in outcome scores over time were explored using repeated measures analysis of variance and compared between subjects with persistent (SD) and recovered (SR) sleep disturbances. Predictors of functional/social outcome were determined using linear regression., RESULTS: The percentages of subjects reporting sleep disturbances at each time point were 71.9%, 57.2%, 55.1%, and 53.7%, respectively. For functional and social outcomes, significant effects of time (F3,315 = 9.54; P < .001), group (SD vs SR) F1,317 = 5.32; P = .022, and time X group interaction F3,315 = 4.14; P = .007 were found. Persistent sleep disturbance (P = 0.011) and higher symptom burden at 6 months postinjury (P < .0001) were independent predictors of poorer outcome., CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbance, independent of psychological distress, is an important prognostic factor of functional and social outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury.",2015,/,The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation,30,6,E67-75,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000119,25931180,#7240,Chan 2015,,yes
Global Outcome and Late Seizures After Penetrating Versus Closed Traumatic Brain Injury: A NIDRR TBI Model Systems Study.,"Walker, William C; Ketchum, James S 3rd; Marwitz, Jennifer H; Kolakowsky-Hayner, Stephanie A; McClish, Donna K; Bushnik, Tamara","BACKGROUND: If and how much dural penetration influences long-term outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is understudied, especially within the civilian population., OBJECTIVES: Using the large TBI Model Systems cohort, this study assessed and compared penetrating TBI (PTBI) and closed TBI with respect to global outcome and late seizures 2 years after injury., METHODS: After performing unadjusted PTBI versus closed TBI comparisons, multivariate regression models were built and analyzed for both outcomes by including the following additional predictors: length of unconsciousness, posttraumatic amnesia duration, hospital length of stay, age, gender, race, marital status, education level, problem substance abuse, and preinjury employment status., RESULTS: The collapsed Glasgow Outcome Scale model (n = 6111) showed significant secondary effects of PTBI with employment status. When employed before injury, individuals with PTBI were 2.62 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.92-3.57) to have a lower Glasgow Outcome Scale category.

Subacute complications during recovery from severe traumatic brain injury: frequency and associations with outcome.,"Godbolt, Alison K; Stenberg, Maud; Jakobsson, Jan; Sorjonen, Kimmo; Krakau, Karolina; Stalnacke, Britt-Marie; Nygren DeBoussard, Catharina","BACKGROUND: Medical complications after severe traumatic brain injury (S-TBI) may delay or prevent transfer to rehabilitation units and impact on long-term outcome., OBJECTIVE: Mapping of medical complications in the subacute period after S-TBI and the impact of these complications on 1-year outcome to inform healthcare planning and discussion of prognosis with relatives., SETTING: Prospective multicentre observational study. Recruitment from 6 neurosurgical centres in Sweden and Iceland., PARTICIPANTS AND ASSESSMENTS: Patients aged 18-65 years with S-TBI and acute Glasgow Coma Scale 3-8, who were admitted to neurointensive care. Assessment of medical complications 3 weeks and 3 months after injury. Follow-up to 1 year. 114 patients recruited with follow-up at 1 year as follows: 100 assessed, 7 dead and 7 dropped out., OUTCOME MEASURE: Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended., RESULTS: 68 patients had >=1 complication 3 weeks after injury. 3 weeks after injury, factors associated with unfavourable outcome at 1 year were: tracheostomy, assisted ventilation, on-going infection, epilepsy and nutrition via nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastroscopy (PEG) tube (univariate logistic regression analyses). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tracheostomy and epilepsy retained significance even after incorporating acute injury severity into the model. 3 months after injury, factors associated with unfavourable outcome were tracheostomy and heterotopic ossification (Fisher's test), infection, hydrocephalus, autonomic instability, PEG feeding and weight loss (univariate logistic regression). PEG feeding and weight loss at 3 months were retained in a multivariate model., CONCLUSIONS: Subacute complications occurred in two-thirds of patients. Presence of a tracheostomy or epilepsy at 3 weeks, and of PEG feeding and weight loss at 3 months, had robust associations with unfavourable outcome that were incompletely explained by acute injury severity.

A Systematic Review of the Effects of Body Temperature on Outcome After Adult Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Madden, Lori Kennedy; DeVon, Holli A","OBJECTIVE: This systematic review describes effects of body temperature alterations defined as fever, controlled normothermia, and spontaneous or induced hypothermia on outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adults., DATA SOURCES: A search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science in July 2013 with no back date restriction except for induced hypothermia (2009)., STUDY SELECTION: Of 1366 titles identified, 712 were reviewed. Sixteen articles met inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials in hypothermia since 2009 (last Cochrane review) or cohort studies of temperature in TBI, measure core and/or brain temperature, neurologic outcome reporting, primarily adult patients, and English language publications. Exclusion criteria were as follows: most patients with non-TBI diagnosis, primarily pediatric patients, case reports, or laboratory/animal studies., DATA SYNTHESIS: Most studies found that fever avoidance resulted in positive outcomes including decreased length of stay in the intensive care unit; mortality; and incidence of hypertension, elevated intracranial pressure, and tachycardia. Hypothermia on admission correlated with poor outcomes. Controlled normothermia improved surrogate outcomes. Prophylactic induced hypothermia is not supported by the available evidence from randomized controlled trial., CONCLUSION: Setting a goal of normothermia, avoiding fever, and aggressively treating fever may be most important after TBI. Further research is needed to characterize the magnitude and duration of temperature alteration after TBI, determine if temperature alteration influences or predicts neurologic outcome, determine if rate of temperature change influences or predicts neurologic outcome, and compare controlled normothermia versus standard practice or hypothermia.",2015,/,The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,47,4,190-203,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JNN.0000000000000142,25951311,#7232,Madden 2015,,yes

Sixty-one patients with mTBI (mean age=27.08; standard deviation [SD], 8.55) underwent scanning at an average of 10 h (SD, 4.26) post-trauma along with assessment of their neuropsychological performance at an average of 4.35 h (SD, 7.08) upon full Glasgow Coma Scale recovery. Results were then compared to 19 healthy control participants (mean age=29.05; SD, 5.84), both in the acute stage and 6 months post-trauma. DTI and neuropsychological measures between acute and chronic phases were compared, and significant differences emerged. Specifically, chronic-phase fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity values showed significant group differences in the corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, and genu of corpus callosum. Findings also demonstrated associations between DTI indices and neuropsychological outcome across two time points.

Community integration 2 years after moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.,"Sandhaug, Maria; Andelic, Nada; Langhammer, Birgitta; Mygland, Aase","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine community integration by the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) 2 years after injury in a divided TBI sample of moderately and severely injured patients. The second aim was to identify social-demographic, injury-related and rehabilitation associated predictors of CIQ., DESIGN: A cohort study., SETTING: Outpatient follow-up., PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-seven patients with moderate (n = 21) or severe (n = 36) TBI were examined with the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) at 2 years after injury. Possible predictors were analysed in a regression model using CIQ total score at 2 years as the outcome measure., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Community Integration Questionnaire., RESULTS: At 2 years follow-up, there was significant difference between the moderately and severely injured patients in the productivity scores (p < 0.003), while difference in the total CIQ scores approached the significance level (p = 0.074). Significant predictors of a higher CIQ score were living with a spouse, higher Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in the acute phase, shorter Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA), longer rehabilitation stay (LOS) and use of rehabilitation service. Use of rehabilitation service (B = 7.766) and living with a spouse (B = 4.251) had the largest influence. This means that living with a spouse, better score on the GCS scale, shorter PTA, longer LOS and use of rehabilitation service after discharge equated to better community integration 2 years after TBI Conclusions: Two years after TBI the moderately injured patients have a higher productivity level than the severely injured patients.

Activation of the kynurenine pathway and increased production of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid following traumatic brain injury in humans.,"Yan, Edwin B; Frugier, Tony; Lim, Chai K; Heng, Benjamin; Sundaram, Gayathri; Tan, May; Rosenfeld, Jeffrey V; Walker, David W; Guillemin, Gilles J; Morganti-Kossmann, Maria Cristina","UNLABELLED: During inflammation, the kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolises the essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP) potentially contributing to excitotoxicity via the release of quinolinic acid (QUIN) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK). Despite the importance of excitotoxicity in the development of secondary brain damage, investigations on the KP in TBI are scarce. In this study, we comprehensively characterised changes in KP activation by measuring numerous metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from TBI patients and assessing the expression of key KP enzymes in brain tissue from TBI victims. Acute QUIN levels were further correlated with outcome scores to explore its prognostic value in TBI recovery., METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with severe TBI (GCS <= 8, three patients had initial GCS = 9-10, but rapidly deteriorated to <=8) were recruited. CSF was collected from admission to day 5 post-injury. TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), QUIN, anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) were measured in CSF. The Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score was assessed at 6 months post-TBI. Post-mortem brains were obtained from the Australian Neurotrauma Tissue and Fluid Bank and used in qPCR for quantitating expression of KP enzymes (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), kynurenase (KYNase), kynurenine amino transferase-II (KAT-II), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3HAO) and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRTase) and IDO1 immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In CSF, KYN, KYNA and QUIN were elevated whereas TRP, AA and 3HAA remained unchanged. The ratios of QUIN:KYN, QUIN:KYNA, KYNA:KYN and 3HAA:AA revealed that QUIN levels were significantly higher than KYN and KYNA, supporting increased neurotoxicity. Amplified IDO1 and KYNase mRNA expression was demonstrated on post-mortem brains, and enhanced IDO1 protein coincided with overt tissue damage. QUIN levels in CSF were significantly higher in patients with unfavourable outcome and inversely correlated with GOSE scores., CONCLUSION: TBI induced a striking activation of the KP pathway with sustained increase of QUIN. The exceeding production of QUIN together with increased IDO1 activation and mRNA expression in brain-injured areas suggests that TBI selectively induces a robust stimulation of the neurotoxic branch of the KP pathway. QUIN's detrimental roles are supported by its association to adverse outcome potentially becoming an early prognostic factor post-TBI.",2015,/,Journal of neuroinflammation,12,101222974,110,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0328-2,26025142,#7206,Yan 2015,,yes
Long-term survival after traumatic brain injury part I: external validity of prognostic models.,"Brooks, Jordan C; Shavelle, Robert M; Strauss, David J; Hammond, Flora M; Harrison-Felix, Cynthia L","OBJECTIVES: To develop prognostic models for long-term survival in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess their external validity in 2 independent populations., DESIGN: Survival analysis., SETTING: Post-discharge from rehabilitation units and long-term follow-up at regional centers., PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of long-term survivors of TBI (N=12,481): the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) cohort comprised 7365 persons who were admitted to a TBIMS facility and were assessed at >=1 years postinjury, and the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) cohort comprised 5116 persons who sustained a TBI and received long-term services from the CDDS., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival/mortality., RESULTS: Older age, male sex, and severity of disability in walking and feeding were significant predictors of increased long-term mortality rates (all P<.05, both databases). The CDDS model predicted 623 deaths for persons in the TBIMS cohort, with an observed-to-expected ratio of .94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.02). The TBIMS model predicted a total of 525 deaths for persons in the CDDS cohort, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99-1.17). Regression calibration statistics were satisfactory, and both models ranked survival times well from shortest to longest (TBIMS: C index, .78; 95% CI, .76-.80; CDDS: C index, .80; 95% CI, .78-.82)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival prognosis in TBI is related to age, sex, and severity of disability. When compared on the basis of these factors, the survival estimates derived from the TBIMS and CDDS cohorts are found to be similar. The close agreement between model predictions and actual mortality rates confirm the external validity of the prognostic models presented herein.

Use of multisequence 3.0-T MRI to detect severe traumatic brain injury and predict the outcome.,"Yuan, L; Wei, X; Xu, C; Jin, Y; Wang, G; Li, Y; Tian, H; Chen, S","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate multisequence 3.0-T MRI in the detection of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and in predicting the outcome., METHODS: 32 patients with sTBI were prospectively enrolled, and multisequence 3.0-T MRI was performed 4-8 weeks post injury. Quantitative data were recorded on each sequence. The ability to display the parenchymal lesions was compared with that of 64-slice spiral CT. The clinical and radiological results were correlated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended scores 6 months after injury., RESULTS: 3.0-T MRI could display more lesions than CT, especially when the lesion was deeply located. The lesion volumes and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) scores were different between good and poor outcome groups on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (p < 0.05). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the splenium of the corpus callosum and brain stem were also different (p < 0.05). Patients with unfavourable outcome showed a significantly higher volume of haemorrhage on susceptibility-weighted imaging than those with favourable outcomes and had haemorrhages generally located more deeply. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the location of haemorrhage and the ADC values of the splenium of the corpus callosum were independent risk factors for poor outcome, with an overall predictive accuracy of 91.4%., CONCLUSION: The joint use of conventional and advanced sequences of 3.0-T MRI can comprehensively detect the pathological changes occurring after sTBI.

Prognostic value of FOUR and GCS scores in determining mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Saika, Amrit; Bansal, Sonia; Philip, Mariamma; Devi, Bhagavatula Indira; Shukla, Dhaval P","BACKGROUND: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is considered the gold standard for assessment of unconsciousness in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) against which other scales are compared. To overcome the disadvantages of GCS, the Full Outline Of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score was proposed. We aimed to compare the predictability of FOUR score and GCS for early mortality, after moderate and severe TBI., METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of patients with moderate and severe TBI.

Evaluation of White Matter Injury Patterns Underlying Neuropsychiatric Symptoms after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Alhilali, Lea M; Delic, Joseph A; Gumus, Serter; Fakhran, Saeed","PURPOSE: To determine if a central axonal injury underlies neuropsychiatric symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by using tract-based spatial statistics analysis of diffusion-tensor images., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, with waiver of informed consent. Diffusion-tensor imaging and serial neurocognitive testing with the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing evaluation were performed in 45 patients with mTBI (38 with irritability, 32 with depression, and 18 with anxiety). Control subjects consisted of 29 patients with mTBI without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps were analyzed by using tract-based spatial statistics with a multivariate general linear model. Diffusion-tensor imaging findings were correlated with symptom severity, neurocognitive test scores, and time to recovery with the Pearson correlation coefficient., RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, patients with mTBI and depression had decreased fractional anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (P = .006), white matter around the nucleus accumbens (P = .03), and anterior limb of the internal capsule (P = .02). Patients with anxiety had diminished fractional anisotropy in the vermis (P = .04). No regions of significantly decreased fractional anisotropy were seen in patients with irritability relative to control subjects. Injury in the region of the nucleus accumbens inversely correlated with recovery time in patients with depression (r = -0.480, P = .005)., CONCLUSION: Unique white matter injury patterns were seen for two major posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Does base deficit predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury?.,"Shallwani, Hussain; Waqas, Muhammad; Waheed, Shahan; Siddiqui, Mubbashira; Froz, Asher; Bari, Muhammad Ehsan","OBJECTIVE: Base Deficit (BD) is a marker of tissue hypoxia in polytrauma patients. It guides resuscitative measures, and predicts outcomes, complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of BD in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to assess if it correlates with the outcomes in these patients., METHOD: This was a retrospective observational study. All patients over the age of 16 years presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital from 2009 to 2013 with isolated TBI, were included. Data was extracted from 2009 to 2013. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 4 and 5 at last follow up was categorized as favorable outcome. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 19 and receiver operative curve (ROC) was generated for BD as a predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome., RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients were analyzed. Ninety-eight (90.7%) were males. Mean age was 36.69 +/- 17.65. Eighty-eight (81.5%) patients had BD, while 20 (18.5%) patients had base excess. 62 (58.5%) of the patients had unfavorable outcomes. BD on admission had a statistically significant negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation (r = -0.239, p = 0.025) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (r = -0.214, p = 0.046). However, there was no statistically significant difference in means of BD between survivors and non survivors. Area under receiver operator curve (ROC) for BD as a predictor of mortality statistically non-significant., CONCLUSION: Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.

Serum Total Cholinesterase Activity on Admission Is Associated with Disease Severity and Outcome in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Zhang, Qing-Hong; Li, An-Min; He, Sai-Lin; Yao, Xu-Dong; Zhu, Jing; Zhang, Zhi-Wen; Sheng, Zhi-Yong; Yao, Yong-Ming","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of neurological disability. In this retrospective study, serum total cholinesterase (ChE) activities were analyzed in 188 patients for diagnostic as well as predictive values for mortality., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Within 72 hours after injury, serum ChE activities including both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were measured. Disease severity was evaluated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Glasgow Coma Score, length of coma, post-traumatic amnesia and injury feature. Neurocognitive and functional scores were assessed using clinical records. Of 188 patients, 146 (77.7%) survived and 42 (22.3%) died within 90 days. Lower ChE activities were noted in the non-survivors vs. survivors (5.94+/-2.19 vs. 7.04+/-2.16 kU/L, p=0.023), in septic vs. non-infected patients (5.93+/-1.89 vs. 7.31+/-2.45 kU/L, p=0.0005) and in patients with extremely severe injury vs. mild injury (6.3+/-1.98 vs. 7.57+/-2.48 kU/L, p=0.049). The trajectories of serum ChE levels were also different between non-survivors and survivors, septic and non-infected patients, mild and severely injured patients, respectively. Admission ChE activities were closely correlated with blood cell counts, neurocognitive and functional scores both on admission and at discharge. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve for ChE was inferior to that for either APACHE II or white blood cell (WBC) count. However, at the optimal cutoff value of 5 kU/L, the sensitivity of ChE for correct prediction of 90-day mortality was 65.5% and the specificity was 86.4%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lower ChE activity (<5 kU/L) was more closely correlated with poor survival than higher ChE activity (>5 kU/L) (p=0.04). After adjusting for other variables, ChE was identified as a borderline independent predictor for mortality as analyzed by Binary logistic regression (P=0.078)., CONCLUSIONS: Lowered ChE activity measured on admission appears to be associated with disease severity and outcome for TBI patients.",2015,/,PloS one,10,6,e0129082,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129082,26107885,#7172,Zhang 2015,,yes

Patients were then stratified into four levels based on admission BAC: None (0 mg/dL), low (0-100 mg/dL), moderate (100-230 mg/dL), and high (>=230 mg/dL). Demographics, patient characteristics, and outcomes were compared across levels. In evaluating 3794 patients, the mortality rate decreased with increasing BAC levels (linear trend P < 0.0001). In determining the relationship between BAC and mortality, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated a high BAC level was significantly protective (adjusted odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.8; P = 0.002). In the largest study to date, a high (>=230 mg/dL) admission BAC was independently associated with improved survival in patients with isolated moderate to severe TBI. Additional research is warranted to investigate the potential therapeutic implications.",2011,/,The American surgeon,77,10,1416-9,,,22127102,#9069,Berry 2011,,yes
The association between skull bone fractures and outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Tseng, Wei-Chun; Shih, Hong-Mo; Su, Yi-Chun; Chen, Hong-Wen; Hsiao, Kuang-Yu; Chen, I-Chuan","BACKGROUND: In traumatic brain injury (TBI), computed tomography (CT) provides a good assessment of anatomic pathologic findings and the prognostic value of CT characteristics has been well discussed. However, few studies have focused on skull bone fracture and its clinical prognostic importance. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effects of skull bone fracture on patients with severe TBI admitted to the emergency unit., METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with isolated severe TBI admitted to the emergency unit of a university hospital from July 2003 to June 2008. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of skull bone fracture identified by the CT scan while in the emergency unit. Mann-Whitney U test and a Student's t test were used to identify the differences between the two groups, whereas logistic regression was applied to determine any significant differences found in the statistical analysis., RESULTS: A total of 197 patients were signed up in our study. Based on the presence of skull bone fracture on CT scan at emergency department, 92 patients (46.7%) comprised the skull bone fracture group and 59 patients (64.1%) of these died. One hundred five patients (53.3%) comprised the nonskull bone fracture group, of which 33 patients (31.4%) died. There is significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.004)., CONCLUSION: This study shows that skull bone fracture is a mortality risk factor for patients with isolated severe blunt TBI.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,71,6,1611-1614,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31823a8a60,22182871,#9058,Tseng 2011,,yes
Acute serum hormone levels: characterization and prognosis after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Wagner, Amy K; McCullough, Emily H; Niyonkuru, Christian; Ozawa, Haishin; Loucks, Tammy L; Dobos, Julie A; Brett, Christopher A; Santarsieri, Martina; Dixon, C Edward; Berga, Sarah L; Fabio, Anthony","Experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) studies report the neuroprotective effects of female sex steroids on multiple mechanisms of injury, with the clinical assumption that women have hormonally mediated neuroprotection because of the endogenous presence of these hormones. Other literature indicates that testosterone may exacerbate injury. Further, stress hormone abnormalities that accompany critical illness may both amplify or blunt sex steroid levels. To better understand the role of sex steroid exposure in mediating TBI, we 1) characterized temporal profiles of serum gonadal and stress hormones in a population with severe TBI during the acute phases of their injury; and 2) used a biological systems approach to evaluate these hormones as biomarkers predicting global outcome. The study population was 117 adults (28 women; 89 men) with severe TBI. Serum samples (n=536) were collected for 7 days post-TBI for cortisol, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Hormone data were linked with clinical data, including acute care mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 6 months. Hormone levels after TBI were compared to those in healthy controls (n=14). Group based trajectory analysis (TRAJ) was used to develop temporal hormone profiles that delineate distinct subpopulations in the cohort. Structural equations models were used to determine inter-relationships between hormones and outcomes within a multivariate model. Compared to controls, acute serum hormone levels were significantly altered after severe TBI. Changes in the post-TBI adrenal response and peripheral aromatization influenced hormone TRAJ profiles and contributed to the abnormalities, including increased estradiol in men and increased testosterone in women. In addition to older age and greater injury severity, increased estradiol and testosterone levels over time were associated with increased mortality and worse global outcome for both men and women. These findings represent a paradigm shift when thinking about the role of sex steroids in neuroprotection clinically after TBI.",2011,/,Journal of neurotrauma,28,6,871-88,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1586,21488721,#9262,Wagner 2011,,yes
Severe traumatic brain injury: consequences of early adverse events.,"Brorsson, C; Rodling-Wahlstrom, M; Olivecrona, M; Koskinen, L-O D; Naredi, S","BACKGROUND: Several factors associated with an unfavourable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been described: prolonged pre-hospital time, secondary referral to a level 1 trauma centre, the occurrence of secondary insults such as hypoxia, hypotension or low end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)). To determine whether adverse events were linked to outcome, patients with severe TBI were studied before arrival at a level 1 trauma centre., METHODS: Prospective, observational study design. Patients with severe TBI (n = 48), admitted to Umea University Hospital between January 2002 to December 2005 were included. All medical records from the site of the accident to arrival at the level 1 trauma centre were collected and evaluated., RESULTS: A pre-hospital time of >60 min, secondary referral to a level 1 trauma centre, documented hypoxia (oxygen saturation <95%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg), hyperventilation (ETCO(2) <4.5 kPa) or tachycardia (heart rate >100 beats/min) at any time before arrival at a level 1 trauma centre were not significantly related to an unfavourable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1-3)., CONCLUSION: Early adverse events before arrival at a level 1 trauma centre were without significance for outcome after severe TBI in the trauma system studied.

Impact of socioethnic factors on outcomes following traumatic brain injury.,"Heffernan, Daithi S; Vera, Roberto M; Monaghan, Sean F; Thakkar, Rajan K; Kozloff, Matthew S; Connolly, Michael D; Gregg, Shea C; Machan, Jason T; Harrington, David T; Adams, Charles A Jr; Cioffi, William G","BACKGROUND: Ethnic minorities and low income families tend to be in poorer health and have worse outcomes for a spectrum of diseases. Health care provider bias has been reported to potentially affect the distribution of care away from poorer communities, minorities, and patients with a history of substance abuse. Trauma is perceived as a disease of the poor and medically underserved. Minorities are overrepresented in low income populations and are also less likely to possess health insurance leading to a potential overlapping effect. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a predominant cause of mortality and long-term morbidity, which imposes a considerable social and financial burden. We therefore sought to determine the independent effect on outcome after TBI from race, insurance status, intoxication on presentation, and median income., METHODS: A 5-year retrospective chart review of admitted trauma patients aged 18 years and older to a Level I trauma center. Zip code of residency was a surrogate marker for socioeconomic status, because median income for each zip code is available from the US Census. Charts review included race, insurance status, mechanisms of trauma, and injuries sustained. Outcomes were placement of tracheostomy, hospital length of stay (HLOS), leaving Against Medical Advice (AMA), and discharge to home versus rehabilitation and mortality., RESULTS: A total of 3,101 TBI patients were included in the analyses. Multivariable logistic and proportional hazard regression analyses were undertaken adjusting for age, gender, Injury Severity Score, and mechanism. Rates of tracheostomy placement were unaffected by race, median income, or insurance status. Race and median income did not affect HLOS, but private insurance was associated with shorter HLOS and intoxication was associated with longer HLOS. Neither race nor intoxication affected rates of AMA, but higher income and private insurance was associated with lower rates of AMA. Non-Caucasian race and lack of insurance had significantly lower likelihood of placement in a rehabilitation center. Mortality was unaffected by race, increased in intoxicated patients, was variably affected by median income, and was lowest in patients with private insurance., CONCLUSIONS: An extremely complex interplay exists between socioethnic factors and outcomes after TBI. Few physicians would claim overt discrimination. Tracheostomy, the factor most directed by the surgeon, was unbiased by race, income, or insurance status. The likelihood of placement in a rehabilitation center was significantly impacted by both race and insurance status. Future prospective studies are needed to better address causation.

Dynamic three-dimensional scoring of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure provides a brain trauma index that predicts outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Kahraman, Sibel; Hu, Peter; Stein, Deborah M; Stansbury, Lynn G; Dutton, Richard P; Xiao, Yan; Hess, John R; Scalea, Thomas M","BACKGROUND: Data on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) guide therapy in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but current linear analytic methods are insufficiently sensitive and specific for prognosis in dynamic situations over time., METHODS: We have developed algorithms incorporating continuous, automated, digital ICP and CPP monitoring data into a pressure times time ""dose"" function. In this study, we calculated cumulative doses using thresholds of ICP >20 mm Hg and CPP <60 mm Hg and graphed these as a Brain Trauma Index (BTI or CPP/ICP). Using receiver operator characteristics analysis, we examined BTI <3 and BTI <2 and various threshold levels of pressure times time doses of ICP and CPP as predictors of 30-day mortality and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) <5 at 6 months and 12 months. Using the data processing and analysis tools underlying this work, we are also piloting a real-time bedside and telemetric display system as a means of indentifying and monitoring critical changes in physiologic metrics, including BTI, CPP, and ICP., RESULTS: Sixty subjects yielded 8678.1 hours of data (5,206,860 data points). BTI <2 was better than CPP <60 mm Hg in predicting unfavorable Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months (p <0.05). An example of linear and graphically processed BTI, CPP, and ICP data from a representative TBI patient is provided., CONCLUSION: Calculation of a BTI from continuous digital data predicts outcome in severe TBI and has potential for the design of real-time bedside early warning systems.

Relationship of serum and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers with intracranial hypertension and cerebral hypoperfusion after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Stein, Deborah M; Lindell, Allison; Murdock, Karen R; Kufera, Joseph A; Menaker, Jay; Keledjian, Kaspar; Bochicchio, Grant V; Aarabi, Bizhan; Scalea, Thomas M","BACKGROUND: There is little that can be done to treat or reverse the primary injury that occurs at the time of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Initial management of the patient with severe TBI focuses on prevention of subsequent secondary insults, namely, intracranial hypertension (ICH) and cerebral hypoperfusion (CH). Currently, there is no reliable way to predict which patients will develop ICH and CH other than clinical acumen; therefore, indicators of impending secondary intracranial insults may be useful in predicting these events and allowing for prevention and early intervention. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship of cytokine levels with intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with severe TBI., METHODS: Patients at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center were prospectively enrolled for a 6-month period. Inclusion criteria were older than 17 years, admission within the first 6 hours after injury, Glasgow Coma Scale<9 on admission, and placement of a clinically indicated ICP monitor. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid, when available, were collected on admission and twice daily for 7 days. Cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were analyzed by multiplex bead array assays. Hourly values for ICP and CPP were recorded, and means, minimum (for CPP) or maximum (for ICP) values, percentage time ICP>20 mm Hg (%ICP20) and CPP<60 mm Hg (%CPP60), and cumulative Pressure Times Time Dose (PTD; mm Hg.h) for ICP>20 mm Hg (PTD ICP20) and CPP<60 mm Hg (PTD CPP60) were compared with the serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels that were drawn before 12-hour time periods (PRE) and after 12-hour time periods (POST) of monitoring., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. In-hospital mortality was 12.5%, and good functional outcome was noted in 58%. Two hundred and seventy-five serum samples were taken and analyzed. IL-6 levels in the serum were found in the highest concentration of the cytokines measured. PTD ICP20 and PTD CPP60 were moderately correlated with increased PRE IL-8 levels (r=0.34, p<0.001; r=0.53, p<0.001). PTD ICP20 was also correlated with PRE TNF-alpha levels (r=0.27, p<0.001) as was PTD CPP60 (r=0.25, p<0.001). POST IL-8 levels were found to be correlated with PTD ICP20 (r=0.46, p<0.001) and PTD CPP60 (r=0.54, p<0.001). POST TNF-alpha was associated with PTD ICP20 (r=0.45, p<0.001). PTD CPP60 was also moderately correlated with POST TNF-alpha levels (r=0.26, p<0.001). When comparing patients with good versus poor outcome, median daily serum IL-8 levels were associated with poor outcome., CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha demonstrated the most promise in this study to be candidate serum markers of impending ICH and CH. The clinical relevance of this is the suggestion that we may be able to predict impending secondary insults after TBI before the clinical manifestation of these events. Given the known morbidity of ICH and CH, early intervention and prevention may have a significant impact on outcome. This becomes even more important when decisions must be made about timing of interventions. Increased levels of IL-8 and TNF-alpha in the serum during episodes of ICH and CH imply there are significant systemic effects of these events. These serum biomarkers are promising as diagnostic targets. In addition, further study of the precise role of these molecules may have significant implications for inflammatory system manipulation in the management of severe TBI.",2011,/,The Journal of trauma,70,5,1096-103,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e318216930d,21610426,#9215,Stein 2011,,yes
Diabetic patients with traumatic brain injury: insulin deficiency is associated with increased mortality.,"Ley, Eric J; Srour, Marissa K; Clond, Morgan A; Barnajian, Moshe; Tillou, Areti; Mirocha, James; Salim, Ali","BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an independent predictor of mortality. Insulin deficiency, as opposed to elevated blood glucose, might be the reason for increased mortality. TBI patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were analyzed to determine how insulin deficiency affects mortality after TBI., METHODS: NTDB version 7 was queried for patients with isolated moderate to severe TBI (head abbreviated injury score [AIS]>=3 with AIS<=3 for other body regions). Demographics and outcomes were compared between TBI patients with insulin-dependent DM (IDDM), noninsulin-dependent DM (NIDDM), and those without DM. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between mortality and DM., RESULTS: Overall, 51,585 patients with isolated moderate to severe TBI were analyzed. Mortality was 14.4% and 8.2% in patients with and without DM, respectively (p<0.0001). Although head AIS scores were similar, patients with DM had a statistically higher Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at presentation compared with patients without DM (GCS score 12.4 vs. GCS score 10.9; p<0.0001). After multivariable logistic regression analysis, DM was an independent predictor for mortality (odds ratio 1.5, confidence interval 1.29-1.74, p<0.0001). When comparing TBI patients with IDDM to NIDDM, mortality was 17.1% for IDDM and 13.0% for NIDDM (p=0.025)., CONCLUSION: DM is a significant predictor for mortality after moderate to severe TBI.

Severity and outcome was evaluated using chosen direct and indirect indicators., RESULTS: The most severe trauma occurred in the traffic-related group followed by falls and injuries with other causes. On the other hand, patients with traffic-related TBI had the best outcome. Age improves the outcome in the traffic-related group significantly. However, in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for age (and other important predictors including level of care) the odds for favourable long-term outcome stayed significantly higher in the traffic-related group., CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the causes of TBI should be considered by both clinicians and public health professionals as a lead in prognosis of outcome and policy planning.",2011,/,Brain injury,25,9,797-805,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2011.581642,21631184,#9209,Majdan 2011,,yes

"Epidemiology, severity classification, and outcome of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective multicenter study.","Andriessen, Teuntje M J C; Horn, Janneke; Franschman, Gaby; van der Naalt, Joukje; Haitsma, Iain; Jacobs, Bram; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Vos, Pieter E","Changes in the demographics, approach, and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients require regular evaluation of epidemiological profiles, injury severity classification, and outcomes. This prospective multicenter study provides detailed information on TBI-related variables of 508 moderate-to-severe TBI patients. Variability in epidemiology and outcome is examined by comparing our cohort with previous multicenter studies. Additionally, the relation between outcome and injury severity classification assessed at different time points is studied. Based on the emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 339 patients were classified as having severe and 129 as having moderate TBI. In 15%, the diagnosis differed when the accident scene GCS was used for classification. In-hospital mortality was higher if severe TBI was diagnosed at both time points (44%) compared to moderate TBI at one or both time points (7-15%, p<0.001). Furthermore, 14% changed diagnosis when a threshold (>=6 h) for impaired consciousness was used as a criterion for severe TBI: In-hospital mortality was<5% when impaired consciousness lasted for<6 h. This suggests that combining multiple clinical assessments and using a threshold for impaired consciousness may improve the classification of injury severity and prediction of outcome. Compared to earlier multicenter studies, our cohort demonstrates a different case mix that includes a higher age (mean=47.3 years), more diffuse (Traumatic Coma Databank [TCDB] I-II) injuries (58%), and more major extracranial injuries (40%), with relatively high 6 month mortality rates for both severe (46%) and moderate (21%) TBI.

Pulsatile intracranial pressure and cerebral autoregulation after traumatic brain injury.,"Radolovich, D K; Aries, M J H; Castellani, G; Corona, A; Lavinio, A; Smielewski, P; Pickard, J D; Czosnyka, M","BACKGROUND: Strong correlation between mean intracranial pressure (ICP) and its pulse wave amplitude (AMP) has been demonstrated in different clinical scenarios. We investigated the relationship between invasive mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) and AMP to explore its potential role as a descriptor of cerebrovascular pressure reactivity after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients suffering from TBI with brain monitoring. Transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity, ABP, ICP were recorded digitally. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and AMP were derived. A new index-pressure-amplitude index (PAx)-was calculated as the Pearson correlation between (averaged over 10 s intervals) ABP and AMP with a 5 min long moving average window. The previously introduced transcranial Doppler-based autoregulation index Mx was evaluated in a similar way, as the moving correlation between blood flow velocity and CPP. The clinical outcome was assessed after 6 months using the Glasgow outcome score., RESULTS: 293 patients were studied. The mean PAx was -0.09 (standard deviation 0.21). This negative value indicates that, on average, an increase in ABP causes a decrease in AMP and vice versa. PAx correlated strong with Mx (R (2) = 0.46, P < 0.0002). PAx also correlated with age (R (2) = 0.18, P < 0.05).

Data on crash, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Data sets from patients who had isolated TBI were selected. Six-month outcomes were classified as ""favorable"" if Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were 5 or 4 and were classified as ""unfavorable"" if Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were 3 or less. The Rotterdam score was used to classify computed tomography (CT) findings. Univariate statistics (Fisher's exact test, t test, chi2 test) and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with hospital mortality and favorable outcome., RESULTS: There were 134 female and 305 male patients.

We investigated the persistence of PCS by using the ""Problem Checklist"" questionnaire. We also assessed their quality of life using a visual analogue scale, and noted the changes in employment status, social activities and family relationships. Then, we examined whether there were significant relationships between these different data., RESULTS: More than half of the patients (n=23, 54.8%) were found with persistent post-concussion symptoms at one year post-injury.

This study reports results from the first of two study visits., PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 147) were recruited within 3 months following presentation to a concussion clinic or an emergency department setting., METHODS: Clinical and demographic information was collected and participants completed a range of questionnaires (Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, Brief COPE, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, Rivermead Follow-Up Questionnaire and HADS). Associations between independent variables and outcome were examined using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals., RESULTS: Preliminary results suggested participants endorsing stronger beliefs about the injury identity (p < 0.05) and emotional impact (p < 0.01) had significantly greater odds of poor outcome at 3 months. There were also associations between higher educational attainment (p < 0.05), using active coping strategies (p < 0.06) and poor outcome., CONCLUSIONS: These variables appeared important determinants of outcome early after MTBI and may help identify those at risk for slow recovery.

Injury severity and outcome: a meta-analysis of prospective studies on TBI outcome.,"Cappa, Kimberly A; Conger, Judith C; Conger, Anthony J","OBJECTIVE: The recent movement to apply evidenced-based approaches to medical and rehabilitation care has increased the importance of approximating outcomes as early in the recovery process as possible. The relationship between injury severity and outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI), however, has remained unclear due to the variety of predictor and criterion variables used throughout the literature., METHOD: A meta-analysis of eligible prospective studies that assessed the bivariate association between injury severity and outcome at 1-year postinjury was conducted., RESULTS: Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria (total N = 21,050 patients). Injury severity was a significant predictor of outcome at 1-year postinjury (r = .257). Homogeneity testing by means of the Q test, Q(n), indicated that injury severity measurement, Q(68) = 1140.76, p < .00001, outcome measurement, Q(42) = 516.63, p < .00001, and outcome measurement construct, Q(4) = 14.65, p = .006, were significant moderators of the injury severity/outcome link. Further, the magnitude of the effect between injury severity and outcome resulted from a significant interaction between the measure of injury severity and the outcome construct., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, measures of injury severity were most significantly associated with measures of global outcome and most poorly associated with measures of satisfaction with life. Additionally, a significant interaction was found between the measure of injury severity and the outcome construct indicating that different measures of injury severity more precisely predict one outcome construct over another.

We measured: a) clinical: exitus yes/no; age and gender, traumatic mechanism, polytraumatism yes/no, GCS score, unconsciousness duration, amnesia duration, neurological focality, and surgical interventions; b) radiological: CT scan for radiological lesions; c) biochemical: serum SB100B at 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after TBI and drug abuse detected in the urine; d) GOS on hospital discharge., RESULTS: N: 149 TBI patients, independent of polytraumatism, mean serum S100B at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours: 2.1, 1.3, 1.2, and 0.6 microg/L, respectively; N: 124 without associated polytraumatism, S100B at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours: 2.0, 1.4, 1.3, and 0.6 microg/L; N: 50 control I S100B 24 hours: 0.17 microg/L (0.04 - 0.56) and 25 healthy subjects S100B 0.057 microg/L (0.02-0.094)., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher S100B levels are observed on exitus, with excellent TBI prognosis and evolution performance. Hospital stay in the NICU produces significant increases in S100B compared to healthy subjects, without invalidating it as a biomarker. Polytraumatism associated to TBI does not significantly alter S100B levels. S100B at 24 hours > or = 0.90 microg/L appears to predict unfavourable TBI evolution with a NPV: 94.2% and PPV: 54.9%.

Thromboelastometric (ROTEM) findings in patients suffering from isolated severe traumatic brain injury.,"Schochl, Herbert; Solomon, Cristina; Traintinger, Stefan; Nienaber, Ulrike; Tacacs-Tolnai, Astrid; Windhofer, Christian; Bahrami, Soheyl; Voelckel, Wolfgang","Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is often accompanied by coagulopathy and an increased risk of bleeding. To identify and successfully treat bleeding disorders associated with sTBI, rapid assessment of coagulation status is crucial. This retrospective study was designed to assess the potential role of whole-blood thromboelastometry (ROTEM( R), Tem International, Munich, Germany) in patients with isolated sTBI (abbreviated injury scale [AIS](head) >=3 and AIS(extracranial) <3). Blood samples were obtained immediately following admission to the emergency room of the Trauma Centre Salzburg in Austria. ROTEM analysis (EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM tests) and standard laboratory coagulation tests (prothrombin time index [PTI, percentage of normal prothrombin time], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen concentration, and platelet count) were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Out of 88 patients with sTBI enrolled in the study, 66 survived and 22 died. PTI, fibrinogen, and platelet count were significantly higher in survivors (p<0.005). Accordingly, aPTT was shorter in this group (p<0.0001). ROTEM analysis revealed shorter clotting times in extrinsically activated thromboelastometric test (EXTEM) and intrinsically activated thromboelastometric test (INTEM) (p<0.001), shorter clot formation times in EXTEM and INTEM (p<0.0001), and higher maximum clot firmness in EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM (p<0.01) in survivors compared with non-survivors. Logistic regression analysis revealed extrinsically activated thromboelastometric test with cytochalasin D (FIBTEM) MCF and aPTT to have the best predictive value for mortality. According to the degree of coagulopathy, non-survivors received more RBC (p=0.016), fibrinogen concentrate (p=0.01), and prothrombin complex concentrate (p<0.001) within 24 h of arrival in the emergency room.

The content of antibodies to basic myelin protein (BMP) and phospholipids (PL) significantly differed from that in the control group (patients with soft tissue head injuries without TBI) and was significantly higher in patients with severe TBI. The level of antibodies to BMP in the CSF was strongly correlated with scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale in the 1st day after TBI and the degree of recovery of neurological status in the 21st day. The level of antibodies to PL was strongly correlated with the severity of cytosis, content of CSF erythrocytes and proteins. The correlation between antibodies to BMP and antibodies to PL was weak. The different diagnostic value of antibodies to BMP and to PL in the most acute period of TBI was found. In conclusion, content of antibodies to BMP may be used as a marker of TBI severity and outcome while the significant elevation of antibodies to PL indicates the severity of vascular complications of trauma.",2011,/,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

However, there is no data on their combined use. ICP measure by ophtalmodynamometry (ODM) of central retinal vein (CR V) never was used for outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of combined use of ICP and SjvO2 measures for outcome prediction in patients with severe TBI. 80 cases of severe TBI with GCS score 8 and lower were studied. In addition to the standard monitoring and intensive therapy SjvO2 and ICP by ODM during acute period of TBI were measured. Positive outcome of acute TBI can be predicted if SjvO2 rate ranges from 55% to 75%. Poor outcome can be predicted if SjvO2 rate is lower than 55%. Patients with normal ICP in this group died from secondary intracranial complications and patients with high ICP died from primary and secondary intracranial injury. Patients with high SjvO2 ( > 75%) also have poor prognostic outcome. The main risks for them are extracerebral complications. It is necessary to use complex monitoring that includes ICP and SjvO2 for accurate prediction of the outcome of TBI.

Correlations between clinical symptoms, CT signs of diffuse and focal traumatic lesions, intracranial hemorrhage, indices of cerebral blood flow (CBF) according to perfusion CT study, intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were assessed. Main mechanism of injury in 27 of 40 (67.5%) patients was acceleration-deceleration due to traffic accidents which usually leads to diffuse axonal injury (DAI) of different severity. In the other 13 (32.5%) cases injury was associated with coup-countercoup mechanism which caused focal contusions mostly. Not only GCS score but CT-signs of DAI severity, intracranial hemorrhage and minimal levels of CPP had significant prognostic value. Results of perfusion CT studies demonstrated that in 37 of 40 (92.5%) patients cerebral blood flow decreased (below 28.6 ml/100 g/min) in one or more arterial blood distribution areas. Increase of CBF was registered in 9 cases (over 69 ml/100 g/min), in 6 of them elevation of CBF in one arterial distribution area was associated with reduction in the other. Generally, mean CBF values were higher in the middle cerebral artery circulation than in the other. The lowest CBF levels (16.3 +/- 6 ml/100 g/min) were observed in cortical and subcortical hemorrhagic foci while these values were significantly higher in the same contralateral intact zones (36.0 +/- 10.0 ml/100 g/min; p < 0.01). In 3 patients with DAI the CBF in the midbrain varied from 12.5 to 30.1 ml/100 g/min with the lowest levels in hemorrhagic focus in cerebral peduncle. It corresponded to cystic-atrophic alterations found on subsequent follow-up MRI.

The value of serum biomarkers in prediction models of outcome after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Topolovec-Vranic, Jane; Pollmann-Mudryj, Mary-Ann; Ouchterlony, Donna; Klein, David; Spence, Julie; Romaschin, Alexander; Rhind, Shawn; Tien, Homer C; Baker, Andrew J","BACKGROUND: To determine, using a civilian model of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), the added value of biomarker sampling upon prognostication of outcome at 1 week and 6 weeks postinjury., METHODS: The Galveston Orientation and Amnesia test was administered, and blood samples for serum protein S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were collected from 141 emergency department patients within 4 hours of a suspected mild TBI (mTBI). The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) was administered via telephone 3 days postinjury. Patients were assessed by a physician at 1 week (n = 113; 80%) and 6 weeks (n = 95; 67%) postinjury. Neurocognitive and postural stability measures were also administered at these follow-ups., RESULTS: Levels of S100B and NSE were found to be abnormally elevated in 49% and 65% of patients with TBI, respectively. Sixty-eight percent and 38% of the patients were considered impaired at 1 week and 6 weeks postinjury, respectively. Stepwise logistic regression modeling identified admission Galveston Orientation and Amnesia test score, S100B level, and RPQ score at day 3 postinjury to be predictive of poor outcome at 1 week postinjury (c-statistic 0.877); female gender, loss of consciousness, NSE level, and RPQ score at day 3 postinjury were predictive of poor outcome at 6 weeks postinjury (c-statistic 0.895). The discriminative power of the biomarkers alone was limited., CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers, in conjunction with other readily available determinants of outcome assessed in the acute period after injury, add value in the early prognostication of patients with mTBI.

Association between blood glucose levels and Glasgow Outcome Score in patients with traumatic brain injury: secondary analysis of a randomized trial,Yuan T.; He H.; Liu Y.; Wang J.; Kang X.; Fu G.; Xie F.; Li A.; Chen J.; Wang W. ,"Background: Blood glucose levels that are too high or too low after traumatic brain injury (TBI) negatively affect patient prognosis. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between blood glucose levels and the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) in TBI patients. Method(s): This study was based on a randomized, dual-center, open-label clinical trial. A total of 208 patients who participated in the randomized controlled trial were followed up for 5 years. Information on the disease, laboratory examination, insulin therapy, and surgery for patients with TBI was collected as candidate variables according to clinical importance. Additionally, data on 5-year and 6-month GOS were collected as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. For multivariate analysis, a generalized additive model (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between blood glucose levels and GOS. The results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We further applied a two- piecewise linear regression model to examine the threshold effect of blood glucose level and GOS. Result(s): A total of 182 patients were included in the final analysis. Multivariate GAM analysis revealed that a bell-shaped relationship existed between average blood glucose level and 5-year GOS score or 6-month GOS score. The inflection points of the average blood glucose level were 8.81 (95% CI: 7.43-9.48) mmol/L considering 5-year GOS as the outcome and were 8.88 (95% CI 7.43-9.74) mmol/L considering 6-month GOS score as the outcome. The same analysis revealed that there was also a bell relationship between average blood glucose levels and the favorable outcome group (GOS score >= 4) at 5 years or 6 months. Conclusion(s): In a population of patients with traumatic brain injury, blood glucose levels were associated with the GOS. There was also a threshold effect between blood glucose levels and the GOS.

Chinese Admission Warning Strategy for Predicting the Hospital Discharge Outcome in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury,Zheng R.; Zhuang Z.; Zhao C.; Zhao Z.; Yang X.; Zhou Y.; Pan S.; Chen K.; Li K.; Huang Q.; Wang Y.; Ma Y. ,"Objective: To develop and validate an admission warning strategy that incorporates the general emergency department indicators for predicting the hospital discharge outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in China. Method(s): This admission warning strategy was developed in a primary cohort that consisted of 605 patients with TBI who were admitted within 6 h of injury. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to develop the early warning strategy of selected indicators. Two sub-cohorts consisting of 180 and 107 patients with TBI were used for the external validation. Result(s): Indicators of the strategy included three categories: baseline characteristics, imaging and laboratory indicators. This strategy displayed good calibration and good discrimination. A high C-index was reached in the internal validation. The multicenter external validation cohort still showed good discrimination C-indices. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed the actual needs of this strategy when the possibility threshold was 0.01 for the primary cohort, and at thresholds of 0.02-0.83 and 0.01-0.88 for the two sub-cohorts, respectively. In addition, this strategy exhibited a significant prognostic capacity compared to the traditional single predictors, and this optimization was also observed in two external validation cohorts. Conclusion(s): We developed and validated an admission warning strategy that can be quickly deployed in the emergency department. This strategy can be used as an ideal tool for predicting hospital discharge outcomes and providing objective evidence for early informed consent of the hospital discharge outcome to the family members of TBI patients.Copyright Â© 2022 by the authors.

Design(s): Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Follow-up at 3 and 12 months postinjury. Setting(s): A level 1 trauma center and an emergency outpatient clinic. Participant(s): Patients with MTBI (n=358), trauma controls (n=75), and community controls (n=78). Main Outcome Measure(s): Symptoms were assessed with the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). Participants were categorized as having moderate to severe PPCS (msPPCS) when reporting >=3 moderate/severe symptoms or a BC-PSI total score of >=13. BC-PSI total scores were compared between the groups and were further used to create cutoffs for reliable change by identifying uncommon and very uncommon change in symptoms in the community control group. Associations between symptom reporting and 25 injury-related and personal factors were examined. Result(s): The MTBI group had a similar prevalence of msPPCS at 3 and 12 months (21%) and reported more symptoms than the control groups. Analyses of individual trajectories, however, revealed considerable change in both msPPCS and BC-PSI total scores in the MTBI group, where both worsening and improvement was common. Intracranial lesions on computed tomography were associated with a greater likelihood of improving from 3 to 12 months. Those with msPPCS at both assessments were more likely to be women and to have these personal preinjury factors: reduced employment, pain, poor sleep, low resilience, high neuroticism and pessimism, and a psychiatric history. Conclusion(s): Group analyses suggest a stable prevalence of msPPCS the first year postinjury. However, there was considerable intraindividual change.

We intended to discern the relationship between serum C1q levels and severity in addition to prognosis following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): In this prospective, observational study, serum C1q levels were quantified in 188 TBI patients and 188 healthy controls. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and Rotterdam computed tomography (CT) classification were used as clinical and radiological indicators of severity. Patients with extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE) score of 1-4 at 6 months after trauma were considered to have a poor outcome. Multiple logistic regression model was built to ascertain the independent association of serum C1q levels with 6-month poor outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was configured for analysis of prognostic capability with respect to serum C1q levels. Result(s): TBI patients exhibited substantially higher serum C1q levels than controls (median, 223.9 mg/l versus 75.4 mg/l).

CT anthropometric analysis of the prognosis of traumatic brain injury: A retrospective study to compare between psoas muscle and abdominal skeletal muscle,Cho H.J.; Hwang Y.; Yang S.-Y.; Kim M. ,"Background: Recent studies have suggested that skeletal muscle area (SMA) and psoas muscle area (PMA), markers for sarcopenia, are associated with the prognosis of many diseases. However, it remains unclear which of the two is a superior prognostic marker. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyse these markers in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): Patients with TBI [abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score of 4 or 5] were selected. Those with an AIS score of 4 or 5 for chest, abdomen, or extremity lesion were excluded. Clinical data, including Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), mortality, and anthropometric data, were collected. SMA and PMA were measured. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and psoas muscle index (PMI) were calculated for each muscle area divided by height squared. The good prognosis group was defined as patients with a GOS score of 4 to 5. The poor prognosis group was defined as those with a GOS score of 1-3. Data of both groups were analysed for the overall prognosis. After excluding patients with a hospital stay of 1 or 2 days, the modified prognosis and mortality of patients were analysed. Result(s): A total of 212 patients were enrolled in the statistical analysis. Patients with good prognosis showed a larger PMA (17.4 cm2 vs. 15.0 cm2, P = 0.002) and PMI (6.1 cm2/ m2 vs. 5.3 cm2/ m2, P = 0.001). After modification, patients with good prognosis showed a larger PMA (17.4 cm2 vs. 14.9 cm2, P = 0.002) and PMI (6.1 cm2/ m2 vs. 5.3 cm2/ m2, P = 0.01). On binary logistic regression analysis, PMI was found to be a significant risk factor for the modified prognosis (Odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 0.763 (0.633 - 0.921), P = 0.005) and modified mortality (OR (95% CI): 0.740 (0.573 - 0.957), P = 0.022). Conclusion(s): Less amount of psoas muscle (PM) was found to be a significant risk factor for the prognosis of patients with TBI. PM was a better prognostic marker than skeletal muscle (SM) in patients with TBI. Further studies are needed to increase our understanding of sarcopenia and TBI.Copyright Â© 2022",2022,/,Injury,,"(Cho, Kim) Department of Trauma Surgery, Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 271, Cheonbo-ro, Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Seoul 11765, South Korea(Hwang) Department of Radiology, Myongji St.Mary's Hospital,",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2022.02.043,2017071924,#18897,Cho 2022,,yes
Machine Learning for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality After Traumatic Brain Injury in Both High-Income and Low- and Middle-Income Countries,Warman P.I.; Seas A.; Satyadev N.; Adil S.M.; Kolls B.J.; Haglund M.M.; Dunn T.W.; Fuller A.T. ,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) holds promise as a tool to guide clinical decision making by predicting in-hospital mortality for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous models such as the international mission for prognosis and clinical trials in TBI (IMPACT) and the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) prognosis calculators can potentially be improved with expanded clinical features and newer ML approaches. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop ML models to predict in-hospital mortality for both the high-income country (HIC) and the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. METHOD(S): We used the Duke University Medical Center National Trauma Data Bank and Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH) registry to predict in-hospital mortality for the HIC and LMIC settings, respectively. Six ML models were built on each data set, and the best model was chosen through nested cross-validation. The CRASH and IMPACT models were externally validated on the MNRH database. RESULT(S): ML models built on National Trauma Data Bank (n = 5393, 84 predictors) demonstrated an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97) while models constructed on MNRH (n = 877, 31 predictors) demonstrated an AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81-0.97). Direct comparison with CRASH and IMPACT models showed significant improvement of the proposed LMIC models regarding AUROC (P = .038). CONCLUSION(S): We developed high-performing well-calibrated ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality for both the HIC and LMIC settings that have the potential to influence clinical management and traumatic brain injury patient trajectories.Copyright Â© Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2022.

Performance of the Hull Salford Cambridge Decision Rule (HSC DR) for early discharge of patients with findings on CT scan of the brain: A CENTER-TBI validation study,Marincowitz C.; Gravesteijn B.; Sheldon T.; Steyerberg E.; Lecky F. ,"Background There is international variation in hospital admission practices for patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and injuries on CT scan. Only a small proportion of patients require neurosurgical intervention, while many guidelines recommend routine admission of all patients. We aim to validate the Hull Salford Cambridge Decision Rule (HSC DR) and the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) criteria to select low-risk patients for discharge from the emergency department. Method A cohort from 18 countries of Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15 patients with injuries on CT imaging was identified from the multicentre Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) Study (conducted from 2014 to 2017) for secondary analysis. A composite outcome measure encompassing need for ongoing hospital admission was used, including seizure activity, death, intubation, neurosurgical intervention and neurological deterioration. We assessed the performance of our previously derived prognostic model, the HSC DR and the BIG criteria at predicting deterioration in this validation cohort. Results Among 1047 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 267 (26%) deteriorated. Our prognostic model achieved a C-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.84). The HSC DR achieved a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%) and specificity of only 4.7% (95% CI: 3.3% to 6.5%) for deterioration. Using the BIG criteria for discharge from the ED achieved a higher specificity (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.9% to 16.1%) and lower sensitivity (94.6%, 95% CI: 90.5% to 97%), with 12/105 patients recommended for discharge subsequently deteriorating, compared with 0/34 with the HSC DR. Conclusion Our decision rule would have allowed 3.5% of patients to be discharged, none of whom would have deteriorated. Use of the BIG criteria may select patients for discharge who have too high a risk of subsequent deterioration to be used clinically. Further validation and implementation studies are required to support use in clinical practice.Copyright Â©",2022,/,Emergency Medicine Journal,39,3,213-219,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210975,635597656,#18887,Marincowitz 2022,,yes
Deep Learning to Predict Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes in the Low-Resource Setting,Adil S.M.; Elahi C.; Patel D.N.; Seas A.; Warman P.; Fuller A.T.; Haglund M.M.; Dunn T.W. ,"OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, accurate patient prognostication is both difficult and essential for high-quality patient care. With the ultimate goal of enhancing TBI triage in LMICs, we aim to develop the first deep learning model to predict outcomes after TBI and compare its performance to that of less complex algorithms. METHOD(S): TBI patients' data were prospectively collected in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2020. To predict good versus poor outcome at hospital discharge, we created deep neural network (DNN), shallow neural network (SNN), and elastic-net regularized logistic regression (LRnet) models. Predictors included 13 easily acquirable clinical variables. We assessed model performance with 5-fold cross-validation to calculate areas under both the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and precision-recall curve (AUPRC), in addition to standardized partial AUPRC (spAUPRC) to focus on comparisons at clinically-relevant operating points. RESULT(S): We included 2164 patients for model training, of which 12% had poor outcomes. The DNN performed best as measured by AUROC (0.941) and spAUPRC in region maximizing recall (0.291), whereas the SNN was best by AUPRC (0.770). In several other comparisons, the LRnet was non-inferior to the neural networks. CONCLUSION(S): We present the first use of deep learning for TBI prognostication, with an emphasis on LMICs, where there is great need for decision support to allocate limited resources. Optimal algorithm selection depends on the specific clinical setting; deep learning is not a panacea, though it may have a role in these efforts.Copyright Â© 2022.

Predicting Neurological Deterioration after Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury: Development and Validation of a Prediction Model Based on Data Collected on Admission,Chen M.; Li Z.; Yan Z.; Ge S.; Zhang Y.; Yang H.; Zhao L.; Liu L.; Zhang X.; Cai Y.; Qu Y. ,"Moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a heterogeneous entity that is poorly defined in the literature. Patients with mTBI have a high rate of neurological deterioration (ND), which is usually accompanied by poor prognosis and no definitive methods to predict. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a prediction model that estimates the ND risk in patients with mTBI using data collected on admission. Data for 479 patients with mTBI collected retrospectively in our department were analyzed by logistic regression models. Bivariable logistic regression identified variables with a p < 0.05. Multi-variable logistic regression modeling with backward stepwise elimination was used to determine reduced parameters and establish a prediction model. The discrimination efficacy, calibration efficacy, and clinical utility of the prediction model were evaluated. The prediction model was validated using data for 176 patients collected from another hospital. Eight independent prognostic factors were identified: hypertension, Marshall scale (types III and IV), subdural hemorrhage (SDH), location of contusion (frontal and temporal contusions), Injury Severity Score >13, D-dimer level >11.4 mg/L, Glasgow Coma Scale score <=10, and platelet count <=152 x 109/L. A prediction model was established and was shown as a nomogram. Using bootstrapping, internal validation showed that the C-statistic of the prediction model was 0.881 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.849-0.909). The results of external validation showed that the nomogram could predict ND with an area under the curve of 0.827 (95% CI: 0.763-0.880). The present model, based on simple parameters collected on admission, can predict the risk of ND in patients with mTBI accurately. The high discriminative ability indicates the potential of this model for classifying patients with mTBI according to ND risk.Â© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",2022,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,39,06-May,371-378,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.0360,637450268,#18860,Chen 2022,,yes
Transcranial Doppler in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Cross-Sectional Study,Khan M.; Ghilzai S.; Waheed A.; Rasan A.; Nasrulla; Rahim F. ,"Aim: To assess the role of transcranial Doppler in patients with severe traumatic brain injury Study design: A cross-sectional study Place and duration: This study was conducted at Mekran Medical college Turbat Pakistan. Methodology: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed on 255 patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 or less on admission. All the patients were on a ventilator. TCD was performed on the first, second, third, and seventh days of the hospital stay. Two out of three of the following were used to define hypoperfusion: 1. A mean velocity of less than 35 cm/sec in the middle cerebral artery 2. The diastolic velocity of the middle cerebral artery is seen to be lesser than 20 cm/sec and 3. A pulsatility index of more than 1.4 was recorded. The following criteria were used to identify vasospasm: Mean velocity of the middle cerebral artery more than 120 cm/sec and Landegaarde index greater than 3. The Lindegaard index is the ratio of middle cerebral artery blood flow to internal carotid artery blood flow. Result(s): The results showed that 141 people (45 percent) had normal readings. Out of the 141 patients, 55 were admitted to a long-term care facility, 43 patients were discharged. Ten of the patients were unconscious or vegetative, and their relatives pleaded for their loved ones to be removed from them. Four people died as a result of brain death, while two others died as a result of injuries. Seventy-two patients (28%) had hypoperfusion, and 71 died, 65 through brain death, 6 from stopping care, and one with mild disability. Vasospasm was present in 69 individuals (27%). Conclusion(s): Patients with normal measures should have a good chance of survival. Hypoperfusion patients had a bad prognosis. The use of nimodipine in patients with vasospasm should be examined, but further research is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness. TCD is helping to assess early prognosis.Copyright Â© 2022 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

Prognosis in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury in a Swedish cohort and external validation of the IMPACT models,Rostami E.; Gustafsson D.; Hanell A.; Howells T.; Lenell S.; Lewen A.; Enblad P. ,"Background: A major challenge in management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to assess the heterogeneity of TBI pathology and outcome prediction. A reliable outcome prediction would have both great value for the healthcare provider, but also for the patients and their relatives. A well-known prediction model is the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) prognostic calculator. The aim of this study was to externally validate all three modules of the IMPACT calculator on TBI patients admitted to Uppsala University hospital (UUH). Method(s): TBI patients admitted to UUH are continuously enrolled into the Uppsala neurointensive care unit (NICU) TBI Uppsala Clinical Research (UCR) quality register. The register contains both clinical and demographic data, radiological evaluations, and outcome assessments based on the extended Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE) performed at 6 months to 1 year. In this study, we included 635 patients with severe TBI admitted during 2008-2020. We used IMPACT core parameters: age, motor score, and pupillary reaction. Result(s): The patients had a median age of 56 (range 18-93), 142 female and 478 male. Using the IMPACT Core model to predict outcome resulted in an AUC of 0.85 for mortality and 0.79 for unfavorable outcome. The CT module did not increase AUC for mortality and slightly decreased AUC for unfavorable outcome to 0.78. However, the lab module increased AUC for mortality to 0.89 but slightly decreased for unfavorable outcome to 0.76. Comparing the predicted risk to actual outcomes, we found that all three models correctly predicted low risk of mortality in the surviving group of GOSE 2-8. However, it produced a greater variance of predicted risk in the GOSE 1 group, denoting general underprediction of risk. Regarding unfavorable outcome, all models once again underestimated the risk in the GOSE 3-4 groups, but correctly predicts low risk in GOSE 5-8. Conclusion(s): The results of our study are in line with previous findings from centers with modern TBI care using the IMPACT model, in that the model provides adequate prediction for mortality and unfavorable outcome. However, it should be noted that the prediction is limited to 6 months outcome and not longer time interval.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",2022,/,Acta Neurochirurgica,164,3,615-624,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-021-05040-6,2014559485,#18842,Rostami 2022,,yes
Controlling nutritional status score and prognostic nutrition index predict the outcome after severe traumatic brain injury,Li Y.; Liu C.; Luo X.; He Q.; Cheng Y.; Shen W.; Xie Z. ,"Objectives: Immune-nutritional status is correlated with a clinical outcome in critical illness. Recently, controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and prognostic nutrition index (PNI) has been reported to predict prognosis following cancer and other diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the CONUT score and PNI and 6-month outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 78 patients with STBI, including the CONUT score and PNI. Patients were divided into high CONUT group and low CONUT group. Patients were also divided into high PNI and low PNI group respectively. The 6-month outcome was evaluated by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS score >=3. Result(s): The unfavorable outcome group had lower Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores, serum albumin, total cholesterol, PNI, and higher CONUT scores (P < 0.05). Both CONUT scores and PNI were strongly correlated with mRS (r = 0.429, P < 0.05; r = -0.590, P < 0.05, respectively). After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios of CONUT scores and PNI for predicting unfavorable outcome were 10.478 (95% CI: 2.793-39.301) and -0.039 (95% CI: 0.008-0.204), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of CONUT scores for predicting unfavorable outcome was 0.777 (95% CI: 0.674-0.880, P < 0.01), which was similar to PNI (0.764, 95% CI: 0.657-0.87, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Both CONUT scores and PNI might be novel independent predictors of the poor outcome in STBI.Copyright Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,/,Nutritional Neuroscience,25,4,690-697,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2020.1804097,2005816068,#18826,Li 2022,,yes
Mixture Model Framework for Traumatic Brain Injury Prognosis Using Heterogeneous Clinical and Outcome Data,Kaplan A.D.; Cheng Q.; Mohan K.A.; Nelson L.D.; Jain S.; Levin H.; Torres-Espin A.; Chou A.; Huie J.R.; Ferguson A.R.; McCrea M.; Giacino J.; Sundaram S.; Markowitz A.J.; Manley G.T. ,"Prognoses of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) outcomes are neither easily nor accurately determined from clinical indicators. This is due in part to the heterogeneity of damage inflicted to the brain, ultimately resulting in diverse and complex outcomes. Using a data-driven approach on many distinct data elements may be necessary to describe this large set of outcomes and thereby robustly depict the nuanced differences among TBI patients' recovery. In this work, we develop a method for modeling large heterogeneous data types relevant to TBI. Our approach is geared toward the probabilistic representation of mixed continuous and discrete variables with missing values. The model is trained on a dataset encompassing a variety of data types, including demographics, blood-based biomarkers, and imaging findings. In addition, it includes a set of clinical outcome assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The model is used to stratify patients into distinct groups in an unsupervised learning setting. We use the model to infer outcomes using input data, and show that the collection of input data reduces uncertainty of outcomes over a baseline approach. In addition, we quantify the performance of a likelihood scoring technique that can be used to self-evaluate the extrapolation risk of prognosis on unseen patients.Copyright Â© 2013 IEEE.",2022,/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,26,3,1285-1296,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3099745,635669404,#18823,Kaplan 2022,,yes
The predictive value of a new brief cognitive test for long-term functional outcome in acute TBI,Potvin M.-J.; Brayet P.; Paradis V.; Overbeek C.; Therrien E.; Dion L.-A.; Bernard F.; Gosselin N.; Rouleau I.; Boucher O.; Giguere J.-F. ,"OBJECTIVE: To determine how results on the EXACT (EXAmen Cognitif abrege en Traumatologie), a new test specifically designed to briefly assess global cognitive functioning during the acute phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI), can predict long-term functional outcome compared to length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), a well-established predictor. DESIGN: Inception cohort. SETTINGS: Level 1 trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 90 patients hospitalized for a moderate or severe TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Performance on the EXACT in the first three months after injury and results on the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) at follow-up one to two years later. RESULT(S): EXACT scores were all correlated with length of PTA and DRS result. Compared to length of PTA, the EXACT added significantly to the regression and improved prediction of functional outcome. More specifically, a total score of <= 80 on the EXACT was associated with a higher rate of long-term disability due to more severe TBI consequences. Behavioral regulation and executive functions were the cognitive domain that showed the most impairment, followed by attention and working memory, and episodic memory. Except for length of PTA and hospital stay, the DRS score was not correlated with other demographic (age, education) or clinical variables (Glasgow Coma Scale and maximum score on the Therapy Intensity Level Scale). CONCLUSION(S): The EXACT can be administered to most patients early in the acute phase of TBI and results could be used, along with other predictors like PTA, to estimate their long-term functional sequelae. The EXACT may be a promising brief cognitive instrument for future studies investigating recovery after TBI.Copyright Â© 2022.

Recurrent Neural Network based Time-Series Modeling for Long-term Prognosis Following Acute Traumatic Brain Injury,Nayebi A.; Tipirneni S.; Foreman B.; Ratcliff J.; Reddy C.K.; Subbian V. ,"We developed a prognostic model for longer-term outcome prediction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) using an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN). The model was trained on admission and time series data obtained from a multi-site, longitudinal, observational study of TBI patients. We included 110 clinical variables as model input and Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOSE) at six months after injury as the outcome variable. Designed to handle missing values in time series data, the RNN model was compared to an existing TBI prognostic model using 10-fold cross validation. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the RNN model is 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) for binary outcomes, whereas the AUC of the comparison model is 0.69 (95% CI 0.67-0.71).

Methods We analyzed images of 30 healthy controls to extract normal fractional anisotropy ranges along 18 white-matter tracts. Then, we analyzed images of 33 patients, compared their fractional anisotropy values with normal ranges extracted from controls, and computed severity of injury to white-matter tracts. We also asked 2 neuroradiologists to rate severity of injury to different brain regions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and susceptibility-weighted imaging. Finally, we built 3 models: (1) fed with neuroradiologists' ratings, (2) fed with white-matter injury measures, and (3) fed with both input types. Results The 3 models respectively predicted survival at 1 year with accuracies of 70%, 73%, and 88%. The accuracy with both input types was significantly better (P < 0.05).

Prognostic value of global deep white matter DTI metrics for 1-year outcome prediction in ICU traumatic brain injury patients: an MRI-COMA and CENTER-TBI combined study,Puybasset L.; Perlbarg V.; Unrug J.; Cassereau D.; Galanaud D.; Torkomian G.; Battisti V.; Lefort M.; Velly L.; Degos V.; Citerio G.; Bayen E.; Pelegrini-Issac M. ,"Purpose: A reliable tool for outcome prognostication in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) would improve intensive care unit (ICU) decision-making process by providing objective information to caregivers and family. This study aimed at designing a new classification score based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion metrics measured in the deep white matter between day 7 and day 35 after TBI to predict 1-year clinical outcome. Method(s): Two multicenter cohorts (29 centers) were used. MRI-COMA cohort (NCT00577954) was split into MRI-COMA-Train (50 patients enrolled between 2006 and mid-2014) and MRI-COMA-Test (140 patients followed up in clinical routine from 2014) sub-cohorts. These latter patients were pooled with 56 ICU patients (enrolled from 2014 to 2020) from CENTER-TBI cohort (NCT02210221). Patients were dichotomised depending on their 1-year Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE) score: GOSE 1-3, unfavorable outcome (UFO); GOSE 4-8, favorable outcome (FO). A support vector classifier incorporating fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measured in deep white matter, and age at the time of injury was developed to predict whether the patients would be either UFO or FO. Result(s): The model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 on MRI-COMA-Train training dataset, and 49% sensitivity for 96.8% specificity in predicting UFO and 58.5% sensitivity for 97.1% specificity in predicting FO on the pooled MRI-COMA-Test and CENTER-TBI validation datasets.

Early predictors of unfavourable outcome in subjects with moderate head injury in the emergency department.,"Fabbri, A; Servadei, F; Marchesini, G; Stein, S C; Vandelli, A","BACKGROUND: Subjects with moderate head injury are a particular challenge for the emergency physician. They represent a heterogeneous population of subjects with large variability in injury severity, clinical course and outcome. We aimed to determine the early predictors of outcome of subjects with moderate head injury admitted to an Emergency Department (ED) of a general hospital linked via telemedicine to the Regional Neurosurgical Centre., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed, prospectively, 12,675 subjects attending the ED of a General Hospital between 1999 and 2005 for head injury. A total of 309 cases (2.4%) with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9-13 were identified as having moderate head injury. The main outcome measure was an unfavourable outcome at 6 months after injury. The predictive value of a model based on main entry variables was evaluated by logistic regression analysis., FINDINGS: 64.7% of subjects had a computed tomographic scan that was positive for intracranial injury, 16.5% needed a neurosurgical intervention, 14.6% had an unfavourable outcome at 6 months (death, permanent vegetative state, permanent severe disability). Six variables (basal skull fracture, subarachnoid haemorrhage, coagulopathy, subdural haematoma, modified Marshall category and GCS) predicted an unfavourable outcome at 6 months. This combination of variables predicts the 6-month outcome with high sensitivity (95.6%) and specificity (86.0%)., INTERPRETATION: A group of selected variables proves highly accurate in the prediction of unfavourable outcome at 6 months, when applied to subjects admitted to an ED of a General Hospital with moderate head injury.",2008,/,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",79,5,567-73,,,17766433,#10503,Fabbri 2008,,yes
Early prediction of outcome in very severe closed head injury.,"Jain, Sandeep; Dharap, Satish B; Gore, Madhuri A","BACKGROUND: People with severe head injury and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < or =5 have a poor outcome and greatly strain limited resources., AIM: To identify patients with the best chances of survival, using routine clinical measures., METHODS: People attending the trauma intensive care unit, who had isolated blunt head injury and GCS or =4h, were included in the study, resuscitated and clinically assessed. The GCS score was followed serially after admission. Bivariate analysis of various parameters with outcome was performed using the chi-square test. Serial GCS scores were compared with admission GCS by paired t-testing., RESULTS: Of the 102 patients who were studied prospectively, 78 (76.5%) died and 24 (23.5%) survived. Age, gender, pre-hospital delay and admission GCS scores were comparable between the two groups. Adequate spontaneous respiration, brisk pupillary light reactivity on admission and increase in GCS by at least 2 at 24h after admission significantly affected the outcome (p<0.05). In the presence of all these factors, the survival rate increased from 6.1% to 57.1% (p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: People with GCS score < or =5 still have a reasonable chance of survival, so all patients should be aggressively managed initially. Better survival was observed among those with adequate spontaneous respiration, good pupillary reaction and improvement in GCS of at least 2 at 24h. These clinical parameters can help to predict survival and thus make best use of limited resources.",2008,/,Injury,39,5,598-603,,,17884053,#10500,Jain 2008,,yes
"Comparison of indices of traumatic brain injury severity: Glasgow Coma Scale, length of coma and post-traumatic amnesia.","Sherer, M; Struchen, M A; Yablon, S A; Wang, Y; Nick, T G","BACKGROUND: Classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity guides management and contributes to determination of prognosis. Common indicators of TBI severity include Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, length of coma (LOC) and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)., OBJECTIVE: To compare GCS, LOC and PTA by examining distributions and intercorrelations and develop multivariable linear regression models for estimating LOC and PTA duration., METHODS: Prospective study of 519 of 614 consecutive patients with TBI. Indices of TBI severity studied were GCS, LOC, PTA and PTA-LOC (the interval from return of command-following to return of orientation). Candidate predictor variables for estimation of LOC, PTA and PTA-LOC intervals were age, years of education, year of injury (before 1997 vs 1997 or later), GCS, LOC (for PTA and PTA-LOC), pupillary responsiveness, type of injury, CT pathology and intracranial operations., RESULTS: Although there was a severity/response relationship between GCS and LOC, PTA and PTA-LOC intervals, there was overlap in these intervals between GCS severity categories. Age, year of injury, GCS, pupillary responsiveness and CT pathology were predictive of LOC. Age, years of education, year of injury, GCS, LOC, pupillary responsiveness and intracranial operations were predictive of PTA duration. Age, years of education, year of injury, GCS, LOC and pupillary responsiveness were predictive of PTA-LOC. GCS and LOC effects were influenced by age., CONCLUSIONS: Predictors for estimating LOC, PTA and PTA-LOC intervals were determined and simple equations were developed.

Early prediction of favourable recovery 6 months after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Stulemeijer, M; van der Werf, S; Borm, G F; Vos, P E","BACKGROUND: Predicting outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is notoriously difficult. Although it is recognised that milder head injuries do not necessarily mean better outcomes, less is known about the factors that do enable early identification of patients who are likely to recover well., OBJECTIVE: To develop and internally validate two prediction rules for identifying patients who have the highest chance for good 6 month recovery., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among patients with MTBI admitted to the emergency department. Apart from MTBI severity indices, a range of pre-, peri- and early post-injury variables were considered as potential predictors, including emotional and physical functioning. Logistic regression modelling was used to predict the absence of postconcussional symptoms (PCS) and full return to work (RTW)., RESULTS: At follow-up, 64% of the 201 participating patients reported full recovery. Based on our prediction rules, patients without premorbid physical problems, low levels of PCS and post-traumatic stress early after injury had a 90% chance of remaining free of PCS. Patients with over 11 years of education, without nausea or vomiting on admission, with no additional extracranial injuries and only low levels of pain early after injury had a 90% chance of full RTW. The discriminative ability of the prediction models was satisfactory, with an area under the curve >0.70 after correction for optimism., CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of patients with MTBI who are likely to have good 6 month recovery was feasible on the basis of relatively simple prognostic models.

Early surgery was necessary for 221 cases, and standard medical therapy [sedation, mannitol, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawal, PaCO2 30-35 mmHg] was used in 135 patients. Reinforced treatment (PaCO2 25-29 mmHg, induced arterial hypertension, muscle relaxants) was used in 179 cases (44%), and second-tier therapies in 80 (20%). Surgical decompression and/or barbiturates were used in 28 of 407 cases (7%). Six-month outcome was recorded in 367 cases using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). The outcome was favorable (good recovery or moderate disability) in 195 cases (53%) and unfavorable (all the other categories) in 172 (47%). HICP was associated with worse outcome. Outcome for cases who had received second-tier therapies was significantly worse (43% favorable at 6 months, p=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: HICP is frequent and is associated with worse outcome. ICP was controlled by early surgery and first-tier therapies in the majority of cases.

Multivariable logistic regression revealed that after adjustment for all other predictors, time to follow commands, and confusion severity predicted employability at discharge and age and confusion severity predicted productivity status at 1 year. Each symptom showed an unadjusted effect on discharge employability. All symptoms except nighttime sleep disturbance or daytime decreased arousal had effects on productivity at 1 year.

This association has not been well documented in traumatic brain injury (TBI)., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association and prognostic significance of cTnI elevation in severe TBI. To evaluate the role of beta-blocker (BB) therapy in TBI patients with elevated cTnI., METHODS: Retrospective review of all blunt trauma patients with severe TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale score [AIS] >/=3) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with serial TnI measurements at a Level I trauma center from January 1998 to December 2005. Patients with AIS score >/=3 to other body regions were excluded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine prognostic significance of TnI elevation., RESULTS: There were 420 severe blunt TBI patients who had serial cTnI measurements during the study period. One hundred twenty-five (29.8%) had an elevated admission cTnI. TBI patients with an elevated cTnI had a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (7.5 vs. 8.7, p < 0.05), higher Injury Severity Score (27.4 vs. 24.8, p < 0.01), and increased hospital mortality (44% vs. 29%, p < 0.05), compared with TBI patients with a normal cTnI. Increasing severity of head injury was associated with an increasing cTnI (TnI level 0.8 mug/L for head AIS score = 3 vs. TnI Level I 0.3 mug/L for head AIS score = 4, 5, p = 0.09). After adjusting for injury severity, elevated cTnI was an independent predictor for mortality (Odds ratio [OR[: 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.46, 22.15, p < 0.0001). BB therapy was associated with a significant survival advantage (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.87, p = 0.03) in TBI patients with any elevation of cTnI., CONCLUSION: Elevated TnI is frequently observed after severe TBI.

"Serum levels of S100B, S100A1B and S100BB are all related to outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.","Nylen, K; Ost, M; Csajbok, L Z; Nilsson, I; Hall, C; Blennow, K; Nellgard, B; Rosengren, L","OBJECTIVES: S100B is an established marker of brain damage. Used in the context as a biochemical marker, S100B denotes a measurement of all S100 proteins, including at least one S100B monomer, i.e. the sum of the two dimers S100A1B and S100BB. Almost all published studies are based on this ""sum concentration"". However, the brain specificity of S100B has been questioned and increased serum levels have also been reported after trauma without head injury. Since the S100B monomer dominates in the brain, we hypothesised that the S100BB dimer should be better related to outcome after severe traumatic brain injury than S100A1B or the ""sum concentration""., METHODS: Daily serum samples were collected from 59 patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Three different ELISA methods were used for measurements of S100B, S100A1B and S100BB respectively. Outcome was assessed after one year and categorised according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale., RESULTS: Serum levels of S100B, S100A1B and S100BB followed the same temporal course, with early maximum and rapidly decreasing values over the first days after the trauma. Maximum serum concentrations of each of the parameters were increased in the patient group with an unfavourable outcome compared with those with a favourable outcome (p = 0.01, 0.006 and 0.004, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Both S100A1B and S100BB were related to outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.

The relationship between abnormal electrophysiology and post-intervention return to work status was also examined., MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Participants with mTBI showed a statistically significant (p<0.05) amplitude reduction for cognitive ERPs and delayed latencies for texture (p<0.05) and cognitive paradigms (p<0.005) compared to controls. Furthermore, participants with mTBI presenting texture or cognitive ERP latency delays upon admission were at significantly (p<0.01) greater risk of negative vocational outcome than mTBI participants with normal electrophysiology., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that individuals with symptomatic mTBI can present selective deficits in complex visual information processing that could interfere with vocational outcome.

"Cerebral apoptosis in severe traumatic brain injury patients: an in vitro, in vivo, and postmortem study.","Minambres, Eduardo; Ballesteros, Maria Angeles; Mayorga, Marta; Marin, Maria Jose; Munoz, Pedro; Figols, Javier; Lopez-Hoyos, Marcos","One of the most important recent observations in traumatic brain injury (TBI) relates to the potential role of apoptosis in secondary brain injury. We aimed to analyze the presence of apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in brain samples from patients with TBI. We also tried to find any association between the in situ results and the in vitro observations in a neuronal model of induced-apoptosis. Brain tissue from the pericontusional zone (PCZ) of patients with traumatic contusions and from post-mortem samples was analyzed. Immunohistochemical analyses of apoptosis-related proteins and the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method to determine the presence of apoptotic cells were performed. Apoptotic rates on neuronal cells induced by jugular bulb vein sera was determined by flow cytometry. TUNEL-positive cells were detected in all PCZ of traumatic contusions and in most of PCZ in post-mortem specimens (none in control; p = 0.026). In vivo samples showed higher expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 (p = 0.027) and Bcl-XL (p = 0.014) than post-mortem samples. In autopsies, the expression of Fas and Bim (p < 0.05) were higher in PCZ than in the zone distal from the contusion. In vitro studies showed that apoptotic rate was an independent factor associated with mortality at 6 months (p = 0.014). In the receiving operator curve (ROC) curve, a cut-off point of 66.5% showed a sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 66.7% in the prediction of patients' death.

DRS scores were comparable across age groups at admission to a rehabilitation center. The oldest group was slightly more disabled at discharge from rehabilitation despite having less severe acute injury severity than the younger groups. Although DRS scores for the 2 younger groups improved significantly from year 1 to year 5, the greatest magnitude of improvement in disability was seen among the youngest group. In addition, after dividing patients into groups according to whether their DRS scores improved (13%), declined (10%), or remained stable (77%) over time, the likelihood of decline was found to be greater for the 2 older groups than for the youngest group. A multiple regression model showed that age has a significant negative influence on DRS score 5 years post-TBI after accounting for the effects of covariates., CONCLUSIONS: This study supported our primary hypothesis that older patients show greater decline over the first 5 years after TBI than younger patients.

Low scores according to Glasgow Coma Scale are also considered as serious poor prognostic factor. The aims of the study were to investigate whether there is a correlation between the two measurements in patients with traumatic brain injury and whether serum neuron-specific enolase levels have potential as a screening test to predict outcome. A total of 169 consecutive patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to our clinic between 2002 and 2005 are included in this study. Those patients, who had any major health problem before trauma, were excluded from the study. However, patients with isolated head injury were included in the study. Serial serum neuron-specific enolase concentrations taken at the first 2, 24, and 48 h after traumatic brain injury were analyzed. A computed tomography was performed on each patient on admission.

Data on patient demographics, injury cause, presenting clinical features and interventions were collected. In-hospital mortality was used as the primary outcome., RESULTS: There were 96 patients who met the inclusion criteria. One-third of the patients were managed palliatively, one-third supportively without surgery and another third underwent surgery. Overall mortality was 70.8% (n = 68). Older age and brainstem injuries were identified as independent predictors of mortality. Mortality was reported in all patients aged 85 years or older., CONCLUSIONS: Although overall outcomes were poor, careful consideration should be given to active treatment as favourable outcomes were possible even in the presence of extremely low GCS scores.

A new scale for prognostication in head injury.,"Ramesh, V G; Thirumaran, K P; Raja, M Chockaiah","The ability to predict the outcome of head injury helps in the efficient use of resources and communicating with the families of the victims. There is need for a simple, easily applicable, objective scale for accurately predicting outcome after severe head injury. A simple, objective bedside scoring system, known as the Madras Head Injury Prognostic Scale (MHIPS), has been devised. It is based upon six well-established prognostic factors: age, best motor response, pupillary light reaction, oculocephalic response, CT scan findings and other systemic injuries. Each factor has been divided into three subgroups and a score assigned based on prognosis. The maximum total score is 18 and the minimum total score is 6. The validity of this scale has been assessed both retrospectively and prospectively. The initial retrospective study involved 355 patients with severe head injury. After correlating the initial MHIPS score with outcome on discharge from the hospital, it was found that most patients with a score of 12 or under died; most patients with a score of 15 and above had a good outcome; and patients with a score of 13 and 14 were either severely disabled or vegetative. The results of the prospective study, which involved 104 patients with severe head injury, showed that the outcome of 87.5% of the patients could be predicted accurately.

We aimed to develop prognostic models with readily available traditional and novel predictors., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospectively collected individual patient data were analyzed from 11 studies. We considered predictors available at admission in logistic regression models to predict mortality and unfavorable outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 mo after injury. Prognostic models were developed in 8,509 patients with severe or moderate TBI, with cross-validation by omission of each of the 11 studies in turn. External validation was on 6,681 patients from the recent Medical Research Council Corticosteroid Randomisation after Significant Head Injury (MRC CRASH) trial. We found that the strongest predictors of outcome were age, motor score, pupillary reactivity, and CT characteristics, including the presence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prognostic model that combined age, motor score, and pupillary reactivity had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between 0.66 and 0.84 at cross-validation. This performance could be improved (AUC increased by approximately 0.05) by considering CT characteristics, secondary insults (hypotension and hypoxia), and laboratory parameters (glucose and hemoglobin). External validation confirmed that the discriminative ability of the model was adequate (AUC 0.80). Outcomes were systematically worse than predicted, but less so in 1,588 patients who were from high-income countries in the CRASH trial., CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic models using baseline characteristics provide adequate discrimination between patients with good and poor 6 mo outcomes after TBI, especially if CT and laboratory findings are considered in addition to traditional predictors. The model predictions may support clinical practice and research, including the design and analysis of randomized controlled trials.",2008,/,PLoS medicine,5,8,e165-e165,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050165,18684008,#10312,Steyerberg 2008,,yes

Grady Memorial Hospital had a higher proportion of females (p = 0.003), and patients were older at GMH (p = 0.0009) compared with patients at KPH and UHWI. The most common mode of injury was a motor vehicle accident at KPH and GMH (42 and 66%, respectively) and assaults at UHWI (37%). Grady Memorial Hospital admitted more patients with severe head injuries (25.5%) than KPH (18.5%) and UHWI (14.4%). More CT scans were performed (p < 0.0001) and a higher proportion of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (p < 0.0001) at GMH. There were no statistically significant differences in median days in the intensive care unit among the 3 hospitals. Patients experienced statistically significant differences in days undergoing ventilation between GMH, KPH, and UHWI (p = 0.004). Intracranial pressure monitoring was performed in 1 patient at KPH, in 6 at UHWI, and in 91 at GMH. There were 174 total deaths, but no statistically significant differences in mortality rates between the 3 sites (p = 0.3). Hospital location and TBI severity were associated with a decreased risk of mortality; patients with severe TBI at GMH had a 53% decrease in the risk of mortality (odds ratio = 0.47, p = 0.04).

Detrended fluctuation analysis of intracranial pressure predicts outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Burr, Robert L; Kirkness, Catherine J; Mitchell, Pamela H","Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a recently developed technique suitable for describing scaling behavior of variability in physiological signals. The purpose of this study is to explore applicability of DFA methods to intracranial pressure (ICP) signals recorded in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In addition to establishing the degree of fit of the power-law scaling model of detrended fluctuations of ICP in TBI patients, we also examined the relationship of DFA coefficients (scaling exponent and intercept) to: 1) measures of initial neurological functioning; 2) measures of functional outcome at six month follow-up; and 3) measures of outcome, controlling for patient characteristics, and initial neurological status. In a sample of 147 moderate-to-severely injured TBI patients, we found that a higher DFA scaling exponent is significantly associated with poorer initial neurological functioning, and that lower DFA intercept and higher DFA scaling exponent jointly predict poorer functional outcome at six month follow-up, even after statistical control for covariates reflecting initial neurological condition.

Head injury and outcome--what influence do concomitant injuries have?.,"Lefering, Rolf; Paffrath, Thomas; Linker, Ralph; Bouillon, Bertil; Neugebauer, Edmund A M; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Unfallchirurgie/German Society for Trauma Surgery","BACKGROUND: Severe head injury (HI) is known to be a major determinant of mortality in patients with multiple injuries but additional injuries also contribute to the clinical outcome. The Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery offers sufficient data for comparative outcome analysis in relation to the injury pattern., METHODS: A total of 21,356 cases from Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery with complete data for pattern of injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS], Injury Severity Score), the incidence of hospital mortality, organ failure, sepsis, duration of hospital stay, and intubation-free days. Maximum AIS severity of HI, including brain, skull, face, and cervical spine, and injuries to the torso and/or extremities (TEI) were used for comparative subgroup analysis., RESULTS: Overall mortality rate was 13.7% (mean age, 41.3 years; 72.6% men; mean Injury Severity Score, 24.4). Patients with relevant HI (AISHI >/=3) were found to have a higher mortality rate (22.1%) than patients with relevant TEI (12.9%). In all HI severity subgroups mortality increased consistently by about 5% with TEI of grade 4, and by 15% with TEI of grade 5, but no increase is observed for lower severity grades. The incidence of organ failure (overall 31.4%), multiple organ failure (15.0%), and sepsis (9.9%) are mainly influenced by the severity of TEI.

Cerebrospinal IL-10 concentration is elevated in non-survivors as compared to survivors after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Kirchhoff, C; Buhmann, S; Bogner, V; Stegmaier, J; Leidel, B A; Braunstein, V; Mutschler, W; Biberthaler, P","OBJECTIVE: The intrathecal posttraumatic inflammation contributes to secondary brain damage as well as to the induction of neuroreparative mechanisms. In this context release of interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been reported to play a major role. However, initial IL-10 concentration in CSF remains incompletely characterized. Therefore, the aim was to analyze Il-10 in CSF and serum of patients early after TBI., METHODS: For control, 10 volunteers receiving spinal puncture were enrolled. In patients with severe TBI (GCS<8 pts.), CSF and serum was drawn within 90+/-45 min after intraventricular catheter insertion (0 h), as well as 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after TBI. Albumin for assessing Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) function and IL-10 (IMMULITE, DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany) were analyzed., RESULTS: 23 patients were enrolled. 15 survived and 8 deceased within 24h. In controls, CSF IL-10 was below detection limit (<5 pg/ml). In contrast, IL-10 was elevated significantly in non-survivors at 0 h vs. survivors and controls (30+/-6 vs. 9+/-1 vs. <5 pg/mL). This was accompanied by a significant increase of serum IL-10 in both groups at 0 h vs. controls (survivors: 30+/-6 pg/mL, non-survivors: 48+/-8 pg/mL, controls: 10+/-7 pg/mL, p<0.001). Survivors revealed signs of a mild BBB dysfunction during the entire observation period. In contrast, non-survivors presented a severe BBB breakage., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated an analysis of IL-10 CSF and serum concentration after TBI. These data support an intrathecal IL-10 synthesis.

Apolipoprotein E polymorphism and gender difference in outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Ost, M; Nylen, K; Csajbok, L; Blennow, K; Rosengren, L; Nellgard, B","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of death and dismal outcome among children and young adults. The morbidity and mortality differ but more aggressive monitoring and more designated neuro intensive care units have improved the results. Studies have demonstrated a connection between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and outcome after TBI, but few are prospective and none is from northern Europe. APOE has three alleles: epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4., METHODS: A total of 96 patients with Glasgow coma score (GCS) < or =8 were prospectively and consecutively included. APOE genotypes were all analyzed at the same laboratory from blood samples by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism., RESULTS: All patients were assessed at 1 year with Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Barthel daily living index. The genotype was available in all patients. Twenty-six patients expressed APOE epsilon4 while 70 patients did not. Outcome demonstrated that patients with APOE epsilon4 had worse outcome vs. those lacking this allele. When subdividing patients into gender, males with APOE epsilon4 did worse, a difference not detected among female patients., CONCLUSIONS: APOE epsilon4 correlated to worse outcome in TBI patients. We also found that males with APOE epsilon4 had poor outcome while females did not.

Those with olfactory dysfunction were assessed as outpatients using the Sniffin' Sticks (n = 19) and olfactory-evoked potential recording (n = 16)., RESULTS: Twenty-one participants (11%) reported a decreased sense of smell after trauma. The incidence of olfactory dysfunction after head injury was 12.8%. The results of the odor-evoked potentials were heterogeneous. A significant correlation was found between olfactory dysfunction and the appearance of skull base fractures and intracranial hemorrhage or hematoma., CONCLUSION: The site of trauma may be more relevant to prognosis than a simple probability (of olfactory loss) based on incidence.

"Temperature disturbances in traumatic brain injury: relationship to secondary insults, barbiturate treatment and outcome.","Elf, Kristin; Nilsson, Pelle; Ronne-Engstrom, Elisabeth; Howells, Tim; Enblad, Per","OBJECTIVES: To describe the occurrence of spontaneous hyper- and hypothermia in patients with traumatic brain injury using a computerized data collecting system, to show how temperature correlates with other secondary insults, to describe how temperature affects outcome and to show how barbiturate treatment influences those analyses., METHODS: Patients with > or = 54 hours of valid monitoring within the first 120 hours after trauma (one value/min) for temperature, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, systolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure and heart rate were included. Correlation analyses were performed between temperature and other secondary insult variables. The non-linear relationship between temperature and outcome (measured by Glasgow outcome scale 6 months post-trauma) was illustrated using a neural network., RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, 44 experienced hyperthermia (>38 degrees C) and 29 experienced hypothermia (<36 degrees C). Hyperthermia correlated with occurrence of high blood pressure and high CPP. In individuals, hyperthermia also correlated with ICP and tachycardia. There was a trend towards better outcome for patients with normal temperature than those with hyper- or hypothermia (favorable outcome 64% versus 29 and 33% respectively). When patients treated with barbiturates were excluded, 60% showed favorable outcome in the hypothermia group as well. Barbiturate treatment also confounded analyses regarding temperature and other secondary insults., DISCUSSION: Patients with hyperthermia, hypertension, high CPP and tachycardia may suffer from a hyperdynamic state. This may worsen outcome and hence clinical awareness is important. Barbiturate treatment confounds several analyses which have not been shown before.

Examining moderators of cognitive recovery trajectories after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.,"Green, Robin E; Colella, Brenda; Christensen, Bruce; Johns, Kadeen; Frasca, Diana; Bayley, Mark; Monette, Georges","OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of cognitive reserve-related moderator variables on recovery trajectories during the first year after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using mixed effects models, we measured (1) the level of cognitive function at 2 and 12 months postinjury and (2) the trajectories of cognitive recovery during the first 12 months postinjury., DESIGN: Repeated-measures design with neuropsychological testing at 2, 5, and 12 months postinjury., SETTING: Large, urban inpatient neurorehabilitation program., PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=75) with moderate-to-severe TBI., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:, PRIMARY OUTCOMES: neuropsychological composite scores including simple speed of processing, complex speed of processing, memory, untimed executive functions, and attention span. Primary predictors: age, estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), and years of education., RESULTS: Only age significantly moderated trajectories. Decreasing age significantly enhanced recovery of speed of processing, both simple (2-12mo postinjury, P<.001) and complex (2-12mo postinjury, P<.05; 5-12mo postinjury, P<.005). Decreasing age and increasing estimated premorbid IQ were associated with higher performance at 2 and 12mo postinjury for simple speed of processing (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo), complex speed of processing (age, 2 and 12mo), untimed executive functions (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo), and memory (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo)., CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of speed of processing (both simple and complex) was favorably moderated by younger age. Older age is associated with more neuronal loss and less integrity of white matter, and speed of processing is associated with white matter networks. The recuperative effects of younger age may therefore be attributable to greater reserve capacity (as indexed by white matter integrity). Lower age and higher estimated premorbid IQ were associated with higher functioning on a variety of cognitive outcomes. This may reflect the buffering effects of reserve capacity or premorbid differences in age and IQ-related cognitive functioning.

In general, the older the victim, the higher the probability of a poor outcome. To investigate the mechanism underlying the link between age and outcome, the data for 797 patients enrolled in the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank (JNTDB), aged 6 years or older, with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 or less on admission or deterioration to that level within 48 h of impact were analyzed. Thirty-eight percent of the patients were between the ages of 40 and 69 years, and 24% of the patients were older than 69 years. Older patients had higher rates of mortality and lower rates of favorable outcome. The frequency of mass lesions which were associated with poorer outcomes significantly increased with age, but regardless of the intracranial lesion type, older patients had poorer outcomes. The GCS score and the occurrence of systemic complications did not differ significantly according to age. Multiple systemic injury was less frequent in older patients. The varied occurrence of intracranial lesion types according to age is likely caused by the disparity between the young and aged brain in the progression of secondary brain injury. Alteration in the pathophysiological response, which is related to the development of secondary brain injury in the aging brain, probably contributes to more severe and irreversible brain damage in older patients, and is thus associated with poor outcomes.",2008,/,Journal of neurotrauma,25,12,1407-14,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2008.0577,19086809,#10212,Tokutomi 2008,,yes

Median age was 22 yrs, and a majority (63%) had traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage., INTERVENTIONS: Hourly assessments of ICP, brain tissue oxygen, mean arterial pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and hemoglobin concentration (hemoglobin) were recorded. Outcome was assessed 6-9 months postinjury., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean (SD) ICP and BTpO2 were 13.7 (6.6) cm H2O and 30.8 (13.6) mm Hg. A total of 13.5% (379) of the BTpO2 values recorded were < 20 mm Hg, only 86 of which were associated with ICP > or = 20 cm H2O. This prevalence was comparable with episodes of ICP elevations above 20 cm H2O (14.1%, 397). Hypoxic episodes were more common when cerebral perfusion pressure was below 60 mm Hg (relative risk = 3.0, p < 0.0001). We did not find an association in hypoxic risk and hemoglobin in the range of 7-12 g/dL or PaCO2 in the range of 25-40 mm Hg. Subjects with hourly episodes (epochs) of hypoxia > 20% of the time had poorer scores on outcome measures compared with those with fewer hypoxic epochs., CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic episodes are common after severe TBI, and most are independent of ICP elevations. Most episodes of hypoxia occur while cerebral perfusion pressure and mean arterial pressure are within the accepted target range. There is no clear association between PaCO2 and hemoglobin with BTpO2. The young age and high prevalence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in this cohort may limit its generalizability.

Neither the risks nor benefit of tight glucose control (goal range, 80-110 mg/dL) have been documented in the TBI population., OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether densely collected blood glucose data, using a computerized algorithm, to maintain tight glycemic control will reveal significant differences in blood glucose control between survivors and nonsurvivors in patients with TBI., METHODS: From October 2005 to April 2006, all ventilated, critically ill surgical patients with TBI Abbreviated Injury Scale score of >or=3 were placed on an automated, euglycemia protocol with every 2-hour blood glucose sampling. Mortalities within 24 hours were excluded. The protocol calculates the insulin rate using a linear equation (rate = blood glucose - 60[M]).

The objective of this study in patients with severe TBI was to: show the range of serum S100B levels during the acute phase after trauma: determine if S100B has potential to discriminate favourable from unfavourable outcome in patients with similar brain injury severity scores and to establish an S100B 'cut-off' predictive for death., METHODS: All patients with severe TBI, admitted to this neurointensive care unit within 24h of injury were eligible for inclusion in the study. One serum blood sample was obtained from each patient at the 24h post-injury time-point. S100B levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Injuries were coded using an internationally recognised injury severity scoring system (ISS). Three-month follow-up was undertaken with outcome assessed using the Glasgow outcome score (GOS)., RESULTS: One hundred patients were recruited. Serum S100B levels ranged from 0.08 to 12.62microgL(-1) S100B levels were significantly higher in patients with a GOS of 1 (death) 2 and 3 (unfavourable outcome) compared with those with GOS 4 and 5 (good recovery). In this study a cut-off point of 0.53microgL(-1) has sensitivity of >80% and specificity of 60% to predict unfavourable outcome and 49% to predict death., CONCLUSION: In 100 patients studied with similar brain injury severity scores, serum S100B measured at the 24-h time-point after injury is significantly associated with outcome but a cut-off 0.53microgL(-1) does not have good prognostic performance.",2009,/,Resuscitation,80,3,341-5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2008.11.021,19150161,#10130,Rainey 2009,,yes
Poor relation between Glasgow coma scale and survival after head injury.,"Matis, Georgios K; Birbilis, Theodossios A","BACKGROUND: Early indicators or predictors of outcome after head injury can affect clinical decision making and the choice of case-specific approaches to rehabilitation., MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective study of 60 patients with a head injury who had been admitted to a tertiary care hospital intensive care unit was undertaken to explore the possible correlations between the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and outcome. The correlation among the GCS, GCS eye (GCS-E), GCS verbal (GCS-V), and GCS motor (GCS-M) components and outcome (survival or death) was assessed by constructing contingency Tables and performing the Pearson chi2 and likelihood ratio tests. The statistical significance was set at a P value of 0.05., RESULTS: The mean total GCS score was 6.39+/-0.554 (6.81+/-0.983 for survivors and 5.55+/-0.706 for nonsurvivors). The most frequent GCS score, which was 3 (61.67%), was followed by scores of 15 and 14 (10% and 6.7%, respectively). No correlation was found between outcome and the GCS, GCS-E, GCS-V, or GCS-M components., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the GCS has a limited predictive value of outcome in patients with a head injury, particularly if used as sole predictor or in patients with a mild-to-moderately severe injury.",2009,/,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,15,2,CR62-65,,,19179969,#10126,Matis 2009,,yes
Persistent hyperglycemia in severe traumatic brain injury: an independent predictor of outcome.,"Salim, Ali; Hadjizacharia, Pantelis; Dubose, Joseph; Brown, Carlos; Inaba, Kenji; Chan, Linda S; Margulies, Daniel","In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), admission hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcome. The effect of persistent hyperglycemia (PH) on outcome in severe TBI, however, remains unknown. We performed a retrospective review of all blunt trauma patients with severe TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Score > or = 3) admitted to the intensive care unit at a Level I trauma center from January 1998 through December 2005. Admission and daily intensive care unit blood glucose levels up to the end of the first week were measured. PH was defined as an average daily blood glucose > or = 150 mg/dL on all days for the first week of the hospital stay. TBI patients with and without PH were compared with respect to baseline demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes. Independent risk factors for mortality were identified using logistic regression analysis. One hundred and five (12.6%) out of 834 severe TBI patients had PH. Patients with PH were older, more severely injured, and had worse head injury compared with patients without PH. After adjusting for significant risk factors, PH was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio (OR): 4.91 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.88-8.56, P < 0.0001]). PH is associated with significantly higher mortality rates in severe TBI patients.",2009,/,The American surgeon,75,1,25-Sep,,,19213392,#10113,Salim 2009,,yes
The role of MR imaging in assessing prognosis after severe and moderate head injury.,"Lagares, Alfonso; Ramos, Ana; Perez-Nunez, Angel; Ballenilla, Federico; Alday, Rafael; Gomez, Pedro A; Kaen, Ariel; Lobato, Ramiro D","PURPOSE: The objective of this work is two-fold: to determine the role of MRI findings in establishing the prognosis of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to our centre, measured with different outcome scales; and to determine in which patients the information given by MR findings adds prognostic information to that from traditional prognostic factors., METHODS: One hundred patients suffering moderate or severe head injury in whom MRI had been performed in the first 30 days after trauma were included. The MRI was evaluated by two neuroradiologists who were not aware of the initial CT results or the clinical situation of the patients. Outcome was determined 6 months after head injury by means of the extended version of the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The prognostic capacity of the different factors related to outcome was compared by the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) for each factor., RESULTS: There exists a clear relation between the depth of the traumatic lesions shown on MRI, and their classification by the proposed scale, and the outcome of patients suffering traumatic brain injury determined by different scales 6 months after injury., CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical substrate of TBI depicted by MRI could be a useful prognostic tool in patients suffering moderate and severe head injury.

Prostacyclin treatment in severe traumatic brain injury: a microdialysis and outcome study.,"Olivecrona, Magnus; Rodling-Wahlstrom, Marie; Naredi, Silvana; Koskinen, Lars-Owe D","UNLABELLED: Prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is a potent vasodilator, inhibitor of leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. In trauma the balance between PGI(2) and thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) is shifted towards TXA(2). Externally provided PGI(2) would, from a theoretical and experimental point of view, improve the microcirculation in injured brain tissue. This study is a prospective consecutive double-blinded randomized study on the effect of PGI(2) versus placebo in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). All patients with sTBI were eligible., INCLUSION CRITERIA: verified sTBI, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at intubation and sedation of or=10 mm Hg, and arrival within 24 h of trauma. All subjects received an intracranial pressure (ICP) measuring device, bilateral intracerebral microdialysis catheters, and a microdialysis catheter in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subjects were treated according to an ICP-targeted therapy based on the Lund concept. 48 patients (mean age of 35.5 years and a median GCS of 6 [3-8]) were included. We found no significant effect of prostacyclin (epoprostenol, Flolan) on either the lactate-pyruvate ratio (L/P) at 24 h or the brain glucose levels. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the two groups. The median Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months was 4, and mortality was 12.5%. The favorable outcome (GOS 4-5) was 52%. The initial L/P did not prognosticate for outcome.

There were 13 patients who received prayer and 13 who did not receive prayer during the hospital stay with almost identical mean Glasgow Coma Scale score. The prayer group stayed in the hospital for more days (P = .03). On multivariate analysis, patients' age (P = .01), admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (P = .009), and prayer habits (P = .007) were significant factors., CONCLUSION: Patients with prayers habits recovered better following severe head injury.

Predicting outcomes of traumatic brain injury by imaging modality and injury distribution.,"Chastain, Cody A; Oyoyo, Udochukwu E; Zipperman, Michelle; Joo, Elliot; Ashwal, Stephen; Shutter, Lori A; Tong, Karen A","Early prediction of outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often difficult. To improve prognostic accuracy soon after trauma, we compared different radiological modalities and anatomical injury distribution in a group of adult TBI patients. The four methods studied were computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). The objective of this study was to identify which modality and anatomic model best predict outcome. The patient population consisted of 38 adults admitted between February 2001 and May 2003. Early CT, T2WI, FLAIR, and SWI were obtained for each patient as well as a Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) between 0.1 and 22 months (mean 9.2 months) after injury. Using a semi-automated computer method, intraparenchymal lesions were traced, measured, and converted to lesion volumes based on slice thickness and pixel size. Lesions were assigned to zones and regions. Outcomes were dichotomized into good (GOS 4-5) and poor (GOS 1-3) outcome groups. Brain injury detected by imaging was analyzed by median total lesion volume, median volume per lesion, and median number of lesions per outcome group. T2WI and FLAIR imaging most consistently discriminated between good and poor outcomes by median total lesion volume, median volume per lesion, and median number of lesions. In addition, T2WI and FLAIR imaging most consistently discriminated between good and poor outcomes by zonal distribution. While SWI rarely discriminated by outcome, it was very sensitive to intraparenchymal injury and its optimal use in evaluating TBI is unclear. SWI and other new imaging modalities should be further studied to fully evaluate their prognostic utility in TBI evaluation.",2009,/,Journal of neurotrauma,26,8,1183-96,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2008.0650,19317591,#10064,Chastain 2009,,yes
Early clinical characteristics of patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms: a prospective study.,"Yang, Chi-Cheng; Hua, Mau-Sun; Tu, Yong-Kwang; Huang, Sheng-Jean","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To identify the early clinical features of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that are predictive of the presence of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS)., RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted at a level I trauma centre., METHODS AND PROCEDURES: One hundred and eighty mTBI patients participated in this study. The post-concussion symptoms (PCS) were evaluated with a PCS checklist. All patients were examined at 1, 2 and 8 weeks post-injury. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the associations of each PCS and the logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mTBI patients who might suffer from PPCS., MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Less than one-tenth of the mTBI patients examined complained of PPCS at 2 months after head trauma. Patients with PPCS are more likely to suffer from intracranial lesions. Moreover, clinical symptoms at 1 and 2 weeks post-injury, especially physical ones including headache, dizziness and fatigue, were reported significantly more often by patients with PPCS., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that early clinical symptoms and intracranial lesions may be strongly associated with the presence of PPCS.

Neuroendocrine function following traumatic brain injury and subsequent intensive care treatment: a prospective longitudinal evaluation.,"Kleindienst, Andrea; Brabant, Georg; Bock, Christoph; Maser-Gluth, Christiane; Buchfelder, Michael","Neuroendocrine dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been described extensively. However, few studies are longitudinal and most lack subtle radiological, clinical, and repetitive endocrine assessment in the acute phase. Accordingly, we prospectively assessed neuroendocrine function in 71 patients after TBI. Injury was documented by a computed tomography (CT). During the first week, critical clinical data (Glasgow Coma Score, APACHE score), treatment variables such as duration of analgosedation for mechanical ventilation, were related to basal pituitary function. More than 2 years later, a subgroup of patients was re-evaluated using dynamic testing with ACTH and GHRH-arginine tests. The Pearson's correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney rank sum test for group differences were used for statistical analysis. None of the CT findings predicted neuroendocrine dysfunction following TBI. The adaptive response to critical illness with significantly elevated cortisol levels on admission and decreased levels thereafter in patients ventilated for more than 24 h (p < 0.05) was attenuated following severe TBI (p < 0.05). However, the coincidence of low serum cortisol and increased urinary excretion of glucocorticoid metabolites in about 80% of patients challenges the relevance of basal hormone measurements. In ventilated patients, total T3 and free T4 were decreased (p < 0.05), TSH was low on day 3 (p < 0.05), and a gonadotropic insufficiency was present (p < 0.05). The thyrotropic and gonadotropic system recovered completely within the follow-up period. With regard to the somatotropic system, neither brain injury severity nor mechanical ventilation was associated with an insufficiency during the acute phase post-injury. However, initially low GH levels predicted a persistent deficiency (r = 0.731, p < 0.001). We conclude that both severe TBI and prolonged mechanical ventilation result in hormonal disturbances early after injury, suggesting a pathophysiological response to brain injury and subsequent intensive care treatment rather than morphological damage.",2009,/,Journal of neurotrauma,26,9,1435-46,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2008.0601,19459759,#10014,Kleindienst 2009,,yes
Brain tissue oxygen monitoring in traumatic brain injury and major trauma: outcome analysis of a brain tissue oxygen-directed therapy.,"Narotam, Pradeep K; Morrison, John F; Nathoo, Narendra","OBJECT: Cerebral ischemia is the leading cause of preventable death in cases of major trauma with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial pressure (ICP) control and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) manipulation have significantly reduced the mortality but not the morbidity rate in these patients. In this study, the authors describe their 5-year experience with brain tissue oxygen (PbtO(2)) monitoring, and the effect of a brain tissue oxygen-directed critical care guide (PbtO(2)-CCG) on the 6-month clinical outcome (based on the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score) in patients with TBIs., METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine patients admitted to Creighton University Medical Center with major traumatic injuries (Injury Severity Scale [ISS] scores >or= 16) and TBI underwent prospective evaluation. All patients were treated with a PbtO(2)-CCG to maintain a brain oxygen level > 20 mm Hg, and control ICP < 20 mm Hg. The role of demographic, clinical, and imaging parameters in the identification of patients at risk for cerebral hypooxygenation and the influence of hypooxygenation on clinical outcome were recorded. Outcomes were compared with those in a historical ICP/CPP patient cohort. Subgroup analysis of severe TBI was performed and compared to data reported in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank., RESULTS: The majority of injuries were sustained in motor vehicle crashes (63%), and diffuse brain injury was the most common abnormality (58%). Mechanism of injury, severity of TBI, pathological entity, neuroimaging results, and trauma indices were not predictive of ischemia. Factors affecting death included gunshot injury, poor trauma indices, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and coma. After standard resuscitation, 65% of patients had an initially low PbtO(2). Data are presented as means +/- SDs. Treatment with the PbtO(2)-CCG resulted in a 44% improvement in mean PbtO(2) (16.21 +/- 12.30 vs 23.65 +/- 14.40 mm Hg; p < 0.001), control of ICP (mean 12.76 +/- 6.42 mm Hg), and the maintenance of CPP (mean 76.13 +/- 15.37 mm Hg). Persistently low cerebral oxygenation was seen in 37% of patients at 2 hours, 31% at 24 hours, and 18% at 48 hours of treatment. Thus elevated ICP and a persistent low PbtO(2) after 2 hours represented increasing odds of death (OR 14.3 at 48 hours). Survivors and patients with good outcomes generally had significantly higher mean daily PbtO(2) and CPP values compared to nonsurvivors. Polytrauma, associated with higher ISS scores, presented an increased risk of vegetative outcome (OR 9.0). Compared to the ICP/CPP cohort, the mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 6 months in patients treated with PbtO(2)-CCG was higher (3.55 +/- 1.75 vs 2.71 +/- 1.65, p < 0.01; OR for good outcome 2.09, 95% CI 1.031-4.24) as was the reduction in mortality rate (25.9 vs 41.50%; relative risk reduction 37%), despite higher ISS scores in the PbtO(2) group (31.6 +/- 13.4 vs 27.1 +/- 8.9; p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis of severe closed TBI revealed a significant relative risk reduction in mortality rate of 37-51% compared with the Traumatic Coma Data Bank data, and an increased OR for good outcome especially in patients with diffuse brain injury without mass lesions (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.9-8.4)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevention and aggressive treatment of cerebral hypooxygenation and control of ICP with a PbtO(2)-directed protocol reduced the mortality rate after TBI in major trauma, but more importantly, resulted in improved 6-month clinical outcomes over the standard ICP/CPP-directed therapy at the authors' institution.",2009,/,Journal of neurosurgery,111,4,672-82,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2009.4.JNS081150,19463048,#10011,Narotam 2009,,yes
Relation between brain lesion location and clinical outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a diffusion tensor imaging study using voxel-based approaches.,"Perlbarg, Vincent; Puybasset, Louis; Tollard, Eleonore; Lehericy, Stephane; Benali, Habib; Galanaud, Damien","The early prediction of consciousness recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is crucial to make decisions about the appropriate use of prolonged intensive care. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed as a biomarker of white matter injury that could be used in a classification purpose. Instead of region-of-interest-based approach, we applied voxel-based approaches (voxel-based DTI and tract-based spatial statistics) on 30 patients with TBI to identify, without any prior, the brain regions that were specifically damaged in unfavorable 1-year outcome group compared to the favorable one. DTI were acquired at mean 23 days (5-53 days) and two DTI-derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were tested. Our results showed that (1) ADC is not a relevant biomarker for early 1-year outcome prognosis; (2) FA measured in inferior longitudinal fasciculus, in cerebral peduncle, in posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in posterior corpus callosum is specifically decreased in unfavorable outcome group compare to the favorable one; (3) a linear discriminant analysis using the FA measured in these four regions showed good classification performance (sensitivity = 86% and specificity = 86%). These findings confirm the relevance of the use of DTI as biomarkers for consciousness recovery after TBI and support the possible use of these biomarkers for early classification of patients.

Predictors of in-hospital mortality and 6-month functional outcomes in older adults after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.,"Utomo, Wesley K; Gabbe, Belinda J; Simpson, Pamela M; Cameron, Peter A","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the single largest cause of death and disability following injury worldwide. While TBI in older adults is less common, it still contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in this group. Understanding the patient characteristics that result in good and poor outcome after TBI is important in the clinical management and prognosis of older adult TBI patients. This population-based study investigated predictors of mortality and longer term functional outcomes following serious TBI in older adults., METHODS: All older adults (aged>64 years), isolated moderate to severe TBI cases from the population-based Victorian State Trauma Registry for the period July 2005 to June 2007 (inclusive) were extracted for analysis. Demographic, injury event, injury diagnosis, management and comorbid status information were obtained and the outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at 6 months post-injury. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and independent living (GOS-E>4) status at 6 months., RESULTS: Of the 428 isolated, older adult TBI cases, the majority were the result of a fall (88%), male (55%), and aged>74 years (76%). The in-hospital death rate was 28% and increasing age (p=0.009), decreasing GCS (p<0.001) and injury type (p=0.002) were significant independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Of the 310 patients who survived to discharge, 65% were successfully followed-up 6 months following injury. There was no difference between patients lost to follow-up and those successfully followed-up with respect to the key population indicators of age, gender, or head injury severity. Younger (<75 years) patients, and those with an SBP on arrival at hospital of 131-150mmHg, were at increased odds of living independently at follow-up. No patients with a GCS<9 had a good 6-month outcome, and most of them died.

The relation between the incidence of hypernatremia and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Maggiore, Umberto; Picetti, Edoardo; Antonucci, Elio; Parenti, Elisabetta; Regolisti, Giuseppe; Mergoni, Mario; Vezzani, Antonella; Cabassi, Aderville; Fiaccadori, Enrico","INTRODUCTION: The study was aimed at verifying whether the occurrence of hypernatremia during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay increases the risk of death in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We performed a retrospective study on a prospectively collected database including all patients consecutively admitted over a 3-year period with a diagnosis of TBI (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score < or = 8) to a general/neurotrauma ICU of a university hospital, providing critical care services in a catchment area of about 1,200,000 inhabitants., METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and ICU laboratory data were prospectively collected; serum sodium was assessed an average of three times per day. Hypernatremia was defined as two daily values of serum sodium above 145 mmol/l. The major outcome was death in the ICU after 14 days. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used, with time-dependent variates designed to reflect exposure over time during the ICU stay: hypernatremia, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) administration as a surrogate marker for the presence of central diabetes insipidus, and urinary output. The same models were adjusted for potential confounding factors., RESULTS: We included in the study 130 TBI patients (mean age 52 years (standard deviation 23); males 74%; median Glasgow Coma Score 3 (range 3 to 8); mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 50 (standard deviation 15)); all were mechanically ventilated; 35 (26.9%) died within 14 days after ICU admission. Hypernatremia was detected in 51.5% of the patients and in 15.9% of the 1,103 patient-day ICU follow-up. In most instances hypernatremia was mild (mean 150 mmol/l, interquartile range 148 to 152). The occurrence of hypernatremia was highest (P = 0.003) in patients with suspected central diabetes insipidus (25/130, 19.2%), a condition that was associated with increased severity of brain injury and ICU mortality. After adjustment for the baseline risk, the incidence of hypernatremia over the course of the ICU stay was significantly related with increased mortality (hazard ratio 3.00 (95% confidence interval: 1.34 to 6.51; P = 0.003)). However, DDAVP use modified this relation (P = 0.06), hypernatremia providing no additional prognostic information in the instances of suspected central diabetes insipidus., CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypernatremia is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with severe TBI. In a proportion of the patients the association between hypernatremia and death is accounted for by the presence of central diabetes insipidus.",2009,/,"Critical care (London, England)",13,4,R110,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc7953,19583864,#9962,Maggiore 2009,,yes
"Race\ethnicity and outcome after traumatic brain injury at a single, diverse center.","Sorani, Marco D; Lee, Michaela; Kim, Helen; Meeker, Michele; Manley, Geoffrey T","BACKGROUND: Many factors may predict mortality and disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI), including age and injury severity. However, the role of race\ethnicity has typically been studied tangentially or in homogeneous settings. We investigated whether race\ethnicity was associated with medical outcomes at a single, diverse center., METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with TBI older than 17 years with blunt injuries admitted to a Level I trauma center from 2001 to 2004. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to determine outcome at discharge. We performed multivariable logistic regression on two measures of outcome by dichotomizing Glasgow Outcome Scale scores., RESULTS: We identified 357 patients with TBI from five categories: whites (46.2%), Asians (19.9%), Hispanics (17.9%), blacks (10.9%), and other\unknown (5.0%). Without adjusting for other factors, Asians experienced higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.25, p = 0.01) compared with whites but not degree of disability. After adjusting for age and Injury Severity Score, a weaker trend remained for higher mortality in Asians (OR = 1.38, p = 0.35), and after excluding cases of assault, the finding was again significant (OR = 2.00, p = 0.04). We also confirmed the recently reported OR of higher mortality among blacks (OR = 1.30). Hispanics seemed to do slightly better at discharge., CONCLUSIONS: The question of whether and how race plays a role in TBI is controversial. At a single, diverse center, we found that mortality is associated with race, age, and Injury Severity Score.

Prospective evaluation of a predictive model of mortality in patients with isolated head injury.,"Ottochian, Marcus; Benfield, Rodd; Inaba, Kenji; Chan, Linda S; Demetriades, Demetrios","BACKGROUND: In a previous retrospective study, we developed a predictive model of survival in isolated head injuries based on easily available parameters such as age, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale, and head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). The purpose of the present study is to prospectively evaluate this predictive model., METHODS: Isolated head injuries admitted to a Level I urban trauma center were prospectively accrued from May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2007. Age, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale, head AIS, and survival status were recorded for each patient. Patients with extracranial AIS >3, head AIS = 6, or hypotension were excluded. These data were entered into our previously developed predictive model and the percentage of correct classification was used to measure how well the predictive model predicted outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated and compared with values obtained from our original, retrospective study., RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-six patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study with an overall mortality of 5.8% (46 patients). When entered into our predictive model, the percentage of correct classification rate was 92% compared with the 94% rate seen in the original study, which is better than other available predictive tools based on combined scoring systems such as the Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology., CONCLUSION: When evaluated prospectively, our predictive model has similar accuracy in predicting survival of all patients with head trauma as our original retrospective study and performs better than other predictive models such as the Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology.

A number of clinical, demographic, and neurosurgical variables of patients with TBI were associated with their outcome., METHODS: We investigated the mortality of Brazilian patients with severe TBI at the time of discharge, using a multiple logistic regression analysis. Clinical, demographic, radiologic, and neurosurgical variables, and mortality at time of discharge of all consecutive patients (n = 748) with severe TBI (admission Glasgow scale  60 years) than younger (up to 30 years) patients (OR = 2.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-4.79, p = 0.006).

Resuscitation with hypertonic saline-dextran reduces serum biomarker levels and correlates with outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients.,"Baker, Andrew J; Rhind, Shawn G; Morrison, Laurie J; Black, Sandra; Crnko, Naomi T; Shek, Pang N; Rizoli, Sandro B","In the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), the choice of fluid and osmotherapy is important. There are practical and theoretical advantages to the use of hypertonic saline. S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and myelin-basic protein (MBP) are commonly assessed biomarkers of brain injury with potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of outcome after TBI, but they have not previously been studied in the context of fluid resuscitation. This randomized controlled trial compared serum concentrations of S100B, NSE, and MBP in adult severe TBI patients resuscitated with 250 mL of 7.5% hypertonic saline plus 6% dextran70 (HSD; n = 31) versus 0.9% normal saline (NS; n = 33), and examined their relationship with neurological outcome at discharge. Blood samples drawn on admission (<or=3 h post-injury), and at 12, 24, and 48 h post-resuscitation were assayed by ELISA for the selected biomarkers. Serial comparisons of biomarker concentrations were made by ANOVA, and relationships between biomarkers and outcome were assessed by multiple regression. On admission, mean (+/-SEM) S100B and NSE concentrations were increased 60-fold (0.73 +/- 0.08 microg/L) and sevenfold (37.0 +/- 4.8 microg/L), respectively, in patients resuscitated with NS, compared to controls (0.01 +/- 0.01 and 6.2 +/- 0.6, respectively). Compared with NS resuscitation, S100B and NSE were twofold and threefold lower in HSD-treated patients and normalized within 12 h. MBP levels were not significantly different from controls in either treatment arm until 48 h post-resuscitation, when a delayed increase (0.58 +/- 0.29 microg/L) was observed in NS-treated patients. Biomarkers were elevated in the patient group showing an unfavorable outcome. HSD-resuscitated patients with favorable outcomes exhibited the lowest serum S100B and NSE concentrations, while maximal levels were found in NS-treated patients with unfavorable outcomes. The lowest biomarker levels were seen in survivors resuscitated with HSD, while maximal levels were in NS-resuscitated patients with fatal outcome.

Intracranial bleeding in patients with traumatic brain injury: a prognostic study.,"Perel, Pablo; Roberts, Ian; Bouamra, Omar; Woodford, Maralyn; Mooney, Jane; Lecky, Fiona","BACKGROUND: Intracranial bleeding (IB) is a common and serious consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). IB can be classified according to the location into: epidural haemorrhage (EDH) subdural haemorrhage (SDH) intraparenchymal haemorrhage (IPH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Studies involving repeated CT scanning of TBI patients have found that IB can develop or expand in the 48 hours after injury. If IB enlarges after hospital admission and larger bleeds have a worse prognosis, this would provide a therapeutic rationale for treatments to prevent increase in the extent of bleeding. We analysed data from the Trauma Audit & Research Network (TARN), a large European trauma registry, to evaluate the association between the size of IB and mortality in patients with TBI., METHODS: We analysed 13,962 patients presenting to TARN participating hospitals between 2001 and 2008 with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15 at presentation or any head injury with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity code 3 and above. The extent of intracranial bleeding was determined by the AIS code. Potential confounders were age, presenting Glasgow Coma Score, mechanism of injury, presence and nature of other brain injuries, and presence of extra-cranial injuries. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and haematoma evacuation. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate the independent effect of large and small size of IB, in comparison with no bleeding, on patient outcomes. We also conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the independent effect on mortality of large IB in comparison with small IB., RESULTS: Almost 46% of patients had at some type of IB. Subdural haemorrhages were present in 30% of the patients, with epidural and intraparenchymal present in approximately 22% each. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that large IB, wherever located, was associated with increased mortality in comparison with no bleeding. We also found that large IB was associated with an increased risk of mortality in comparison with small IB. The odds ratio for mortality for large SDH, IPH and EDH, in comparison with small bleeds, were: 3.41 (95% CI: 2.684.33), 3.47 (95% CI: 2.265.33) and 2.86 (95% CI: 1.864.38) respectively., CONCLUSION: Large EDH, SDH and IPH are associated with a substantially higher probability of hospital mortality in comparison with small IB. However, the limitations of our data, such as the large proportion of missing data and lack of data on other confounding factors, such as localization of the bleeding, make the results of this report only explanatory.

Both hypoxemia and extreme hyperoxemia may be detrimental in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Davis, Daniel P; Meade, William; Sise, Michael J; Kennedy, Frank; Simon, Fred; Tominaga, Gail; Steele, John; Coimbra, Raul","An association between hypoxemia and poor outcomes from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is well documented. However, it is unclear whether hyperoxygenation is beneficial. This registry-based analysis explores the relationship between early hypoxemia and hyperoxemia on outcome from moderate-to-severe TBI. TBI patients (Abbreviated Injury Scale score 3+) were identified from the San Diego County trauma registry. Patients were stratified by arrival partial oxygen pressure (Po(2)) value. Trauma and injury severity score (TRISS) was then used to calculate predicted survival for each patient, with the mean observed-predicted survival differential determined for each arrival Po(2) stratification. Logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between hypoxemia, hyperoxemia, and outcome from TBI after adjusting for multiple variables including intubation and ventilation status. A total of 3420 patients were included in the analysis. TRISS calculations revealed worse outcomes than predicted for both hypoxemia and extreme hyperoxemia. Logistic regression revealed an optimal Po(2) range (110-487 mm Hg), with an independent association observed between decreased survival and both hypoxemia (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42, 0.69; p < 0.001) and extreme hyperoxemia (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.36, 0.71; p < 0.001). The association between hypoxemia and extreme hyperoxemia and worse outcomes was also present with use of ""good outcomes"" as the outcome variable (discharge to home, rehabilitation, jail, or psychiatric facility, or leaving against medical advice).

Patients were classified into ETOH-positive and ETOH-negative groups, according to the serum ETOH levels and compared for differences in outcomes using logistic regression to adjust for clinically and statistically relevant confounding factors., RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, 482 severe TBI patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center had a serum ETOH level measured on admission. A total of 47% of severe TBI patients were tested for ETOH. ETOH levels were positive in 37% (179) and negative in 63% (303) of the TBI patients. The ETOH-positive group had a higher percentage of males (91% vs. 79%, p = 0.001), lower percentage of penetrating injuries (9% vs. 20%, p = 0.002), and lower injury severity score (25.7 +/- 11.5 vs. 28.4 +/- 14.1, p = 0.05). Overall mortality was significantly lower in the ETOH-positive group at 27% versus 40% (odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.82; p = 0.004). This survival benefit remained significant after multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.92; adjusted p = 0.02).

Construct validity of an attention rating scale for traumatic brain injury.,"Hart, Tessa; Whyte, John; Ellis, Colin; Chervoneva, Inna","Attention deficits are nearly ubiquitous after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the subacute phase of moderate to severe TBI, these deficits may be difficult to measure with the precision needed to predict outcomes, assess degree of recovery, and monitor treatment response. This article reports the findings of four studies, three observational and one a randomized, controlled treatment trial of methylphenidate (MP), designed to provide construct validation of the Moss Attention Rating Scale (MARS), an observational measure of attention dysfunction following TBI. One hundred seven participants with moderate to severe TBI were enrolled during treatment on an inpatient rehabilitation unit. MARS scores were provided independently by four rehabilitation disciplines (Physical, Occupational and Speech Therapies and Nursing). Results indicated that the MARS: (1) is more strongly related to concurrent measures of cognitive versus physical disability, supporting its validity as a measure of cognition, (2) is more strongly related to concurrent psychometric measures of attention versus measures thought to rely less on attention, supporting its validity as a measure of attention; and (3) predicts 1-year outcomes of TBI better than psychometric measures of attention. However, the MARS (4) was not differentially affected by MP versus placebo treatment.

Vestibulo-ocular monitoring as a predictor of outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Schlosser, Hans-Georg; Lindemann, Jan-Nikolaus; Vajkoczy, Peter; Clarke, Andrew H","INTRODUCTION: Based on the knowledge that traumatic brainstem damage often leads to alteration in brainstem functions, including the vestibulo-ocular reflex, the present study is designed to determine whether prediction of outcome in the early phase after severe traumatic brain injury is possible by means of vestibulo-ocular monitoring., METHODS: Vestibulo-ocular monitoring is based on video-oculographic recording of eye movements during galvanic labyrinth polarization. The integrity of vestibulo-ocular reflex is determined from the eye movement response during vestibular galvanic labyrinth polarization stimulation. Vestibulo-ocular monitoring is performed within three days after traumatic brain injury and the oculomotor response compared to outcome after six months (Glasgow Outcome Score)., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent vestibulo-ocular monitoring within three days after severe traumatic brain injury. One patient was excluded from the study. In 16 patients oculomotor response was induced, in the remaining 11 patients no oculomotor response was observed. The patients' outcome was classified as Glasgow Outcome Score 1-2 or as Glasgow Outcome Score 3 to 5. Statistical testing supported the hypothesis that those patients with oculomotor response tended to recover (exact two-sided Fisher-Test (P < 10-3))., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that vestibulo-ocular monitoring with galvanic labyrinth polarization performed during the first days after traumatic brain injury helps to predict favourable or unfavourable outcome.

Perfusion computed tomography in the acute phase of mild head injury: regional dysfunction and prognostic value.,"Metting, Zwany; Rodiger, Lars A; Stewart, Roy E; Oudkerk, Matthijs; De Keyser, Jacques; van der Naalt, Joukje","OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of disability and death. Most patients sustain a mild head injury with a subgroup that experiences disabling symptoms interfering with return to work. Brain imaging in the acute phase is not predictive of outcome, as 20% of noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scans on admission is normal in patients with a suboptimal outcome. The aim of this study was to perform perfusion CT imaging in the acute phase of mild head injury in patients without intracranial abnormalities on the noncontrast CT, to assess whether these patients had cerebral perfusion abnormalities. Furthermore, the relation between perfusion CT parameters and severity of head injury and outcome was evaluated., METHODS: In patients with mild head injury and normal noncontrast CT, perfusion CT was performed directly after admission. The perfusion data were compared with data of 25 healthy control subjects. Outcome was determined 6 months after injury with the extended Glasgow Coma Outcome Scale score and return to work., RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were included. In patients with a decreased Glasgow Coma Scale score, a significant decrease of cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume was detected in the frontal and occipital gray matter. In logistic regression analyses, decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume in the frontal lobes predicted worse outcome according to the extended Glasgow Coma Outcome Scale score.

[Change in plasma microparticle procoagulant activity after traumatic brain injury].,"Huang, Man; Cai, Hua-bo; Hu, Yue-yu; Dong, Xiao-qiao","OBJECTIVE: To observe the serial changes of plasma microparticle procoagulant activity in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and evaluate its correlations with outcome and pathophysiology of TBI., METHODS: A total of 139 consecutive patients with isolated moderate or severe head trauma and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma samples were obtained on entry in healthy controls, as well as on admission and at day 1, day 2, day 3, day 5, and day 7 after TBI in the patients. Its concentration was measured by a prothrombinase assay., RESULTS: Fifty patients (36.0%) died from TBI in a month. After TBI, plasma microparticle procoagulant activity in the patients increased during the 6-hour period immediately, peaked in 24 hours and decreased gradually thereafter. It was substantially higher than that of healthy controls during the 7-day period using analysis of covariate (P < 0.01). A multivariate analysis selected plasma microparticle procoagulant activity (OR 1.432, 95% CI 1.194-1.719, P < 0. 01) as an independent predictor for 1-month mortality. Plasma microparticle procoagulant activities of non-survivals were statistically significantly higher than those of survivals (P = 0.01), and plasma microparticle procoagulant activities of patients with severe TBI were obviously higher than those of patients with moderate TBI (P = 0.002) using repeated-measures analysis. Plasma microparticle procoagulant activities of patients were negatively associated with Glasgow coma scale scores using Spearman correlation coefficient (P < 0.05). A multivariate linear regression selected plasma D-dimer level (P = 0.012) and plasma C-creative protein level (P = 0.019) related to plasma microparticle procoagulant activities. A receiver operating characteristic curve identified the cutoff levels of plasma microparticle procoagulant activities (12.2 U/ml) predicting 1-month mortality of patients with the high sensitivity (72.0%) and specificity values (85.4%). Areas under curve (AUC) of plasma resistin level (AUC = 0.847 +/- 0.037) was smaller than those of GCS scores (AUC = 0.917 +/- 0.023), but this difference failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.104)., CONCLUSION: Increased activity of plasma microparticle procoagulant is found after traumatic brain injury. It may contribute to inflammatory reaction and coagulation cascade and is associated with a poor clinical outcome.",2009,/,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,89,32,Aug-65,,,20095339,#9834,Huang 2009,,yes
[Evaluation of the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism as a prognostic factor in severe head injury and the inclusion of this indicator in a predictive model].,"Martinez Lucas, P; Carbayo Herencia, J A; Moreno Cuesta, J; Jordan, J; Garcia Cuesta, D C; Escribano Martinez, J","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Physiologic variables have traditionally been studied as prognostic factors in severe head injury. Until recently it was not thought that genetic factors might play a role. The main objective of this study was to construct a logistic regression model including physiologic variables and the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, which can promote neuron death through apoptosis., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 90 patients admitted to the postoperative recovery unit with severe head injury. Patients with previous neurologic deficits were excluded. Clinical variables were recorded. The p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction of DNA in blood. Neurologic outcome was assessed on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. A predictive logistic regression model was then constructed based on relevant candidate variables (sex, age, poor Glasgow score, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, pupil size, pupil reactivity, subarachnoid hemorrhage, number of days in the recovery unit, number of days on mechanical ventilation, and the early development of hypotension) in addition to the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism., RESULTS: The Arg/Arg polymorphism was an independent predictor of poor outcome (odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1132; P = .032). The selected model (including the variables age, gene polymorphism, pupil reactivity, and Glasgow score) had adequate discriminatory power (sensitivity 823%, 95% CI 72.8%-91.8%; specificity 78.6%, 95% CI 63.4%-93.8%), classifying 81.1% of the patients correctly.

[Risk factors associated with the presence of pneumonia in patients with brain injury].,"Yepes, David; Molina, Francisco; Ortiz, Gloria; Aguirre, Ricardo","INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia in patients with head trauma occurs commonly; however, few data are available to evaluate the effects of the infection on the prognosis., OBJECTIVE: The incidence and microbiological findings were described, and the associated risk factors were established with the appearance of pneumonia in patients with severe brain trauma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted that included 39 patients with severe brain trauma and who required mechanical ventilation; initially, none had pneumonia. These patients were observed during a 24-month period in an attempt to discern the principal risk factors associated with the onset of pneumonia., RESULTS: Pneumonia occurred in 31 (80%) of the 39 patients, and 28 of these presented early pneumonia. The most frequent germ in patients with pneumonia was Staphylococcus aureus with a percentage of the 42.4%. In the multivariate analysis, the single statistically significant risk factor was the presence of hypotension and vasopressor support with a RR = 27.9 (95% CI = 1.0-749.9, p < 0.05). No significant differences in the days of mechanical ventilation or mortality in both groups. The major mortality-associated risk factor in patients with pneumonia was a low Glasgow score at admittance with an OR = 2.19 (95% CI 1.03 - 4.65), p < 0.05., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumonia in patients with severe brain trauma is high; however, its appearance does not affect the prognosis.

The prognostic value of neuron-specific enolase in head trauma patients.,"Meric, Emine; Gunduz, Abdulkadir; Turedi, Suleyman; Cakir, Ertugrul; Yandi, Mustafa","In recent years, in addition to neurological examination and neuroradiologic examinations, attempts have been made to assess the severity of post-traumatic brain injury and to obtain an early idea of patient prognosis using biochemical markers with a high degree of brain tissue specificity. One such enzyme is neuron-specific enolase (NSE). This study investigates the correlation between serum NSE levels, Glasgow Coma Score, and prognosis measured by Glasgow Outcome Scores in head trauma patients. This was a prospective study conducted with 80 trauma patients presenting to the Emergency Department. Patients were divided into four groups. The first group consisted of patients with general body trauma, but no head trauma. The second group had minor head trauma. The third group had moderate head trauma, and the fourth group had severe head trauma. The relationship between subjects' admission NSE levels and admission and discharge Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) and Glasgow Outcome Scores (GOS) 1 month later was examined. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using a serum NSE cutoff level of 20.52 ng/mL and a GOS of 3 or less as the definition of poor neurologic outcome. There was a significant difference in the NSE levels between group 1 (general trauma) and group 3 (moderate head trauma). There was also a statistically significant difference in NSE levels between group 1 (general trauma) and group 4 (severe head trauma) (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between NSE levels and GOS as determined within groups 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe head trauma) (p < 0.05). When NSE levels were compared with admission GCS, it was found that GCS fell as NSE levels rose. There was no significant correlation between NSE and GCS within groups 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe). There was a statistically significant correlation within group 2 (mild) (p < 0.05). By ROC analysis, serum NSE was 87% sensitive and 82.1% specific in predicting poor neurologic outcome in the study patients. The area under the curve was 0.931. This study shows that initial serum NSE levels in moderate and severe head trauma patients correlate inversely with GOS 1 month later, but only within the moderate and severe head trauma groups. However, serum NSE was 87% sensitive and 82.1% specific in predicting poor neurologic outcome in all of the study patients. This derived cutoff value now needs to be prospectively validated.

Tau proteins in serum predict outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Liliang, Po-Chou; Liang, Cheng-Loong; Weng, Hui-Ching; Lu, Kang; Wang, Kuo-Wei; Chen, Han-Jung; Chuang, Jiin-Haur","BACKGROUND: The identification of reliable outcome predictors after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is crucial. The objective of our study was to investigate the role of tau protein as a serum marker of TBI., METHODS: Thirty-four patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score at admission <or= 8) were considered. The tau protein level in the blood samples obtained at the time of admission was measured. The outcome was assessed by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 mo post-injury. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were analyzed to study their effect on the outcome., RESULTS: tau Protein levels were higher in the poor outcome group (436.2 +/- 473.6 pg/mL) than in the good outcome group (51.6 +/- 81.5 pg/mL) (P < 0.0001). Univariate analyses demonstrated that poor outcome was significantly associated with a poor GCS score (P = 0.001), higher serum tau protein levels (P < 0.001), abnormal pupil light reflex (P = 0.013), and basal cistern compression on computed tomogram (CT) (P = 0.026). Multivariate analyses revealed that a poor GCS score (P = 0.049) and higher serum tau protein levels (P = 0.043) were independent prognostic factors for poor outcome. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that a tau protein level >or= 114.5 pg/mL yielded 88% sensitivity and 94% specificity for predicting a poor outcome., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in addition to GCS; serum tau protein levels may serve as indicators for the prediction of outcome following severe TBI. However; it should be viewed with caution because of the small sample size and wide standard deviations. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Extended analysis of early computed tomography scans of traumatic brain injured patients and relations to outcome.,"Nelson, David W; Nystrom, Harriet; MacCallum, Robert M; Thornquist, Bjorn; Lilja, Anders; Bellander, Bo-Michael; Rudehill, Anders; Wanecek, Michael; Weitzberg, Eddie","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is responsible for up to 45% of in-hospital trauma mortality. Computed tomography (CT) is central to acute TBI diagnostics, and millions of brain CT scans are conducted yearly worldwide. Though many studies have addressed individual predictors of outcome from findings on CT scans, few have done so from a multivariate perspective. As these parameters are interrelated in a complex manner, there is a need for a better understanding of them in this context. CT scans from 861 TBI patients were reviewed according to an extensive protocol. An extended analysis of CT parameters with respect to outcome was performed using linear and non-linear methods. We identified complex interactions and mutual information in many of the parameters. Variables predicting death differ from those predicting unfavorable versus favorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 1-3 versus 4-5 [GOS]). The most important parameter for prediction of unfavorable outcome is the magnitude of midline shift. In fact, this parameter, as a continuous variable, is by itself a better predictor and is better calibrated than the Marshall CT score, even for predicting death. In addition, hematoma volumes are nearly co-linear with midline shift and can be substituted for it. A score of traumatic subarachnoid/intraventricular blood components adds substantially to model calibration. A CT scoring system geared toward dichotomous GOS scores is suggested. CT parameters were found to add 6-10% additional estimated explained variance in the presence of the important clinical variables of age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and pupillary response. Finally we present a practical clinical ""rule of thumb"" to help predict the probability of unfavorable outcome using clinical and CT variables.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,1,51-64,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.0986,19698072,#9799,Nelson 2010,,yes

Injury severity was assessed by the GCS score, Marshall Classification on computed tomography and a complicated postinjury course. Mortality was assessed at 6 wks and long-term outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome score 6 months after injury. TBI patients had significantly elevated CSF levels of UCH-L1 at each time point after injury compared to uninjured controls. Overall mean levels of UCH-L1 in TBI patients was 44.2 ng/mL (+/-7.9) compared with 2.7 ng/mL (+/-0.7) in controls (p <.001). There were significantly higher levels of UCH-L1 in patients with a lower GCS score at 24 hrs, in those with postinjury complications, in those with 6-wk mortality, and in those with a poor 6-month dichotomized Glasgow outcome score., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that this novel biomarker has the potential to determine injury severity in TBI patients.

Inclusion criteria consisted of a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score  10 mm Hg, and arrival to the hospital < 24 hours after trauma. Blood samples for the analysis of apolipoprotein E allele types were collected. Independent staff members evaluated outcomes by obtaining Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 3, 12, and 24 months., RESULTS: The occurrence of the epsilon4 allele was analyzed in 46 patients (mean age 35 +/- 2.2 years with a median GCS score of 6 [range 3-8]). The epsilon4 allele was present in 39.1% of the patients. The ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, and injury severity score were not statistically significantly different between the groups.

This study was conducted to assess the frequency, outcome, and risk factors associated with this complication., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the large, multi-center population-based Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (TR-DGU), we retrospectively analyzed adult patients with isolated blunt TBI (intracranial AIS(HEAD) >or= 3 and extracranial AIS scores <3) for the presence of acute post-traumatic coagulopathy upon emergency room (ER) arrival. Coagulopathy was defined as prothrombin time test (Quick's value) <70% and/or platelets < 100,000/microl., RESULTS: From a total of 3,114 eligible patients with isolated TBI, 706 (22.7%) presented with coagulopathy upon ER arrival. Coagulopathy was associated with higher rates of craniotomies (P = 0.02), of single and multiple organ failure and with less intubation-free days. In surviving patients, ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay were significantly longer, if coagulopathy had been present at admission. The overall hospital mortality was 50.4% (n = 356) in patients with coagulopathy vs. 17.3% (n = 417) in non-coagulopathic patients (all P < 0.001).

The objective was to explore the occurrence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and determine whether DAI was related to level of consciousness and patient outcome., METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients (age range 5-65 years) with traumatic brain injury, who survived the acute phase, and who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-13 were admitted between October 2004 and August 2008. Of these 159 patients, 106 were examined using MR imaging within 4 weeks postinjury. Patients were classified into 1 of 3 stages of DAI: Stage 1, in which lesions were confined to the lobar white matter; Stage 2, in which there were callosal lesions; and Stage 3, in which lesions occurred in the dorsolateral brainstem. The outcome measure used 12 months postinjury was the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)., RESULTS: Diffuse axonal injury was detected in 72% of the patients and a combination of DAI and contusions or hematomas was found in 50%. The GCS score was significantly lower in patients with ""pure DAI"" (median GCS Score 9) than in patients without DAI (median GCS Score 12; p < 0.001). The GCS score was related to outcome only in those patients with DAI (r = 0.47; p = 0.001). Patients with DAI had a median GOSE score of 7, and patients without DAI had a median GOSE score of 8 (p = 0.10).

The status of the fourth ventricle and ambient cisterns predict outcome in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.,"Jacobs, Bram; Beems, Tjemme; van der Vliet, Ton M; Borm, George F; Vos, Pieter E","Computed tomography (CT) of the head has become the diagnostic tool of choice, particularly for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Various CT characteristics are associated with outcome, and may therefore be used as outcome predictors. One of the most prominent predictors appears to be the status of the basal cisterns. This study describes the prognostic value of the appearance of individual cisterns and ventricles in relation to that of the basal cisterns. Further, we determine the interrater and intrarater reliability in the evaluation of the cisterns and ventricles. All consecutive moderate and severe adult TBI patients admitted to our hospital were included in this study as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study (RUBICS). Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-trauma using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). The predictive value of cisterns and ventricles was determined using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. We included 126 moderate and 574 severe TBI patients. Absence (complete obliteration), but also compression of the ambient cisterns and/or the fourth ventricle were strongly related to unfavorable outcome and death and emerged as the only significant outcome predictors after multivariate analysis. The assessment of the ambient cisterns and the fourth ventricle had a satisfactory inter- and intrarater reliability (kappa coefficients: 0.80-0.95). We conclude that, because obliteration of the ambient cisterns and the fourth ventricle both are better than the status of the basal cisterns as outcome predictors, they might be used in CT prediction models in cases of moderate and severe TBI.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,2,331-40,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.1105,19852584,#9774,Jacobs 2010,,yes
Influence of PARP-1 polymorphisms in patients after traumatic brain injury.,"Sarnaik, Ajit A; Conley, Yvette P; Okonkwo, David O; Barr, Taura L; Fink, Ericka L; Szabo, Csaba; Kochanek, Patrick M; Clark, Robert S B","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) plays an important role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage. However, excessive activity of PARP-1 exacerbates brain injury via NAD+ depletion and energy failure. The purpose of this study was to determine if tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) covering multiple regions of the PARP-1 gene are related to outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. DNA from 191 adult patients with severe TBI was assayed for four tSNPs corresponding to haplotype blocks spanning the PARP-1 gene. Categorization as favorable or poor outcome was based on Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assigned at 6 months. PARP-1 enzyme activity was indirectly evaluated by quantifying poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-modified proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and gender, the AA genotype of SNP rs3219119 was an independent predictor of favorable neurologic outcome. This SNP tags a haplotype block spanning the automodification and catalytic domains of the PARP-1 gene. SNP rs2271347 correlated with CSF PAR-modified protein level. This SNP, which did not correlate with outcome, tags a haplotype block spanning the promoter region of the PARP-1 gene. We conclude that after severe TBI in humans, a PARP-1 polymorphism within the automodification-catalytic domain is associated with neurological outcome, while a polymorphism within the promoter region was associated with CSF PAR-modified protein level. These findings must be replicated in a prospective study before the relevance of PARP-1 polymorphisms after TBI can be established.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,3,465-71,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.1171,19925161,#9769,Sarnaik 2010,,yes

The cohort was a consecutive sample of rehabilitation patients enrolled in the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research funded TBI Model Systems (n = 1332) that had documented finite PTA duration greater than 24 h, and 1-year and 2-year GOS., RESULTS: The cohort had proportionally more Good Recovery (44% vs 39%) and less Severe Disability (19% vs 23%) at year 2 than at year 1. Longer PTA resulted in an incremental decline in probability of Good Recovery and a corresponding increase in probability of Severe Disability. When PTA ended within 4 weeks, Severe Disability was unlikely (<15% chance) at year 1, and Good Recovery was the most likely GOS at year 2. When PTA lasted beyond 8 weeks, Good Recovery was highly unlikely (<10% chance) at year 1, and Severe Disability was equal to or more likely than Moderate Disability at year 2., CONCLUSIONS: Two PTA durations, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, emerged as particularly salient GOS probability thresholds that may aid prognostication after TBI.",2010,/,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",81,1,Sep-87,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2008.161570,20019222,#9754,Walker 2010,,yes
Use of an artificial neural network to predict head injury outcome.,"Rughani, Anand I; Dumont, Travis M; Lu, Zhenyu; Bongard, Josh; Horgan, Michael A; Penar, Paul L; Tranmer, Bruce I","OBJECT: The authors describe the artificial neural network (ANN) as an innovative and powerful modeling tool that can be increasingly applied to develop predictive models in neurosurgery. They aimed to demonstrate the utility of an ANN in predicting survival following traumatic brain injury and compare its predictive ability with that of regression models and clinicians., METHODS: The authors designed an ANN to predict in-hospital survival following traumatic brain injury. The model was generated with 11 clinical inputs and a single output. Using a subset of the National Trauma Database, the authors ""trained"" the model to predict outcome by providing the model with patients for whom 11 clinical inputs were paired with known outcomes, which allowed the ANN to ""learn"" the relevant relationships that predict outcome. The model was tested against actual outcomes in a novel subset of 100 patients derived from the same database. For comparison with traditional forms of modeling, 2 regression models were developed using the same training set and were evaluated on the same testing set. Lastly, the authors used the same 100-patient testing set to evaluate 5 neurosurgery residents and 4 neurosurgery staff physicians on their ability to predict survival on the basis of the same 11 data points that were provided to the ANN. The ANN was compared with the clinicians and the regression models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discrimination., RESULTS: Compared with regression models, the ANN was more accurate (p < 0.001), more sensitive (p < 0.001), as specific (p = 0.260), and more discriminating (p < 0.001). There was no difference between the neurosurgery residents and staff physicians, and all clinicians were pooled to compare with the 5 best neural networks. The ANNs were more accurate (p < 0.0001), more sensitive (p < 0.0001), as specific (p = 0.743), and more discriminating (p < 0.0001) than the clinicians., CONCLUSIONS: When given the same limited clinical information, the ANN significantly outperformed regression models and clinicians on multiple performance measures. While this paradigm certainly does not adequately reflect a real clinical scenario, this form of modeling could ultimately serve as a useful clinical decision support tool. As the model evolves to include more complex clinical variables, the performance gap over clinicians and logistic regression models will persist or, ideally, further increase.",2010,/,Journal of neurosurgery,113,3,585-90,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2009.11.JNS09857,20020844,#9752,Rughani 2010,,yes
Outcome prediction in mild traumatic brain injury: age and clinical variables are stronger predictors than CT abnormalities.,"Jacobs, Bram; Beems, Tjemme; Stulemeijer, Maja; van Vugt, Arie B; van der Vliet, Ton M; Borm, George F; Vos, Pieter E","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common heterogeneous neurological disorder with a wide range of possible clinical outcomes. Accurate prediction of outcome is desirable for optimal treatment. This study aimed both to identify the demographic, clinical, and computed tomographic (CT) characteristics associated with unfavorable outcome at 6 months after mTBI, and to design a prediction model for application in daily practice. All consecutive mTBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score: 13-15) admitted to our hospital who were age 16 or older were included during an 8-year period as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study (RUBICS). Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-trauma using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), dichotomized into unfavorable (GOSE score 1-6) and favorable (GOSE score 7-8) outcome groups. The predictive value of several variables was determined using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. We included 2784 mTBI patients and found CT abnormalities in 20.7% of the 1999 patients that underwent a head CT. Age, extracranial injuries, and day-of-injury alcohol intoxication proved to be the strongest outcome predictors. The presence of facial fractures and the number of hemorrhagic contusions emerged as CT predictors. Furthermore, we showed that the predictive value of a scheme based on a modified Injury Severity Score (ISS), alcohol intoxication, and age equalled the value of one that also included CT characteristics. In fact, it exceeded one that was based on CT characteristics alone. We conclude that, although valuable for the identification of the individual mTBI patient at risk for deterioration and eventual neurosurgical intervention, CT characteristics are imperfect predictors of outcome after mTBI.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,4,655-68,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2009.1059,20035619,#9747,Jacobs 2010,,yes
"Automated measurement of ""pressure times time dose"" of intracranial hypertension best predicts outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.","Kahraman, Sibel; Dutton, Richard P; Hu, Peter; Xiao, Yan; Aarabi, Bizhan; Stein, Deborah M; Scalea, Thomas M","BACKGROUND: Earlier, more accurate assessment of secondary brain injury is essential in management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We assessed the accuracy and utility of high-resolution automated intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) recording and their analysis in patients with severe TBI., METHODS: ICP and CPP data for 30 severe TBI patients were collected automatically at 6-second intervals. The degree and duration of ICP and CPP above and below treatment thresholds were calculated as ""pressure times time dose"" (PTD; mm Hg . h) using automated recordings (PTDa) or manual recordings (PTDm) for early stage (trauma resuscitation unit [TRU]) and total monitoring time (TRU and intensive care unit)., RESULTS: Bland-Altman plots showed lack of agreement between PTDa and PTDm. For ICP >20 mm Hg and CPP <60 mm Hg, PTDa, but not PTDm, was significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4). Total PTDa for ICP >20 mm Hg and CPP <60 mm Hg had high predictive power for functional outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.92 +/- 0.05 and 0.82 +/- 0.08, respectively) and inhospital mortality (0.76 +/- 0.15 and 0.79 +/- 0.14, respectively) and were strongly correlated with length of intensive care unit stay (p = 0.009 and 0.007), length of hospital stay (p = 0.009 and 0.005), and discharge Glasgow Coma Scale scores (p = 0.008 and p = 0.038). PTDa of CPP >100 mm Hg during TRU monitoring and during the first 24 hours showed highest predictive power for mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.72 +/- 0.18 and 0.85 +/- 0.13, respectively).

Hierarchical log linear analysis of admission blood parameters and clinical outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Helmy, Adel; Timofeev, Ivan; Palmer, Christopher R; Gore, Alison; Menon, David K; Hutchinson, Peter J","PURPOSE: Numerous statistical methods have been utilised to generate predictive models that identify clinical and biochemical parameters of prognostic value following traumatic brain injury. While these methods provide an accurate statistical description between these variables and outcome, they are difficult to interpret intuitively. Hierarchical log linear analysis can be utilised to present the complex interactions between these variables and outcome visually., METHODS: We compiled a database of 327 traumatic brain injury patients, their admission blood parameters, clinical admission parameters, and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score. Seven variables (age, injury severity, Glasgow Coma Score, glucose, albumin, haemoglobin, white cell count) that correlated with outcome in a univariate analysis and two further variables, included on the basis of biological plausibility, (abnormal clotting and magnesium) were used to derive and present a hierarchical log linear model., RESULTS: Seventeen (out of an original forty-five possible) inter-relationships between the chosen variables were identified as remaining in the hierarchical log linear model. This data is presented pictorially in a hierarchy demonstrating the directness of the statistical association between each of the variables and dichotomised outcome. Four variables within the hierarchical log linear model (age, raised serum glucose, low haemoglobin, Glasgow Coma Score) had a direct independent statistical relationship with outcome. The remaining five variables only had a statistical relationship with outcome via at least one other variable., CONCLUSIONS: Hierarchical log linear analysis allows the presentation of multivariate, categorical data sets in a pictorial and more easily interpretable fashion.",2010,/,Acta neurochirurgica,152,6,953-7,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-009-0584-y,20069321,#9737,Helmy 2010,,yes
The course of intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury: relation with outcome and CT-characteristics.,"Bremmer, Rosette; de Jong, Bauke M; Wagemakers, Michiel; Regtien, Joost G; van der Naalt, Joukje","BACKGROUND: One of the predictive factors of outcome in traumatic brain injury is high intracranial pressure (ICP). Recently, the time course of ICP has been described but few data are available on the relation of these ICP profiles and outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation of the time course of ICP with CT-findings and outcome., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 246 patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit., RESULTS: Early rise in ICP (within the first 2 days) was present in 32%, an intermediate rise (between days 3 and 5) in 34% and a late rise (after day 5) in 34% of patients. Half of the patients with a normal opening pressure (76%) developed intermediate or late ICP rise profiles. More mass lesions and sub/epidural hematomas were present in the late rise group. Patients with a late ICP rise required significant more intensive treatment (65% vs. 37 and 33%) when compared to the early and intermediate rise groups. In multiple regression analysis both ICP profiles and extracranial hematomas were related to outcome. With late ICP rise more unfavorable outcome (46 vs. 17%, P < 0.001) was seen although one in four patients showed a favorable outcome., CONCLUSION: During ICP monitoring different ICP profiles are present over time. These profiles are related to CT-characteristics and outcome.

Detectable levels of cytochrome C and activated caspase-9 in cerebrospinal fluid after human traumatic brain injury.,"Darwish, Ribal S; Amiridze, Nana S","BACKGROUND: The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis has been proposed as one mechanism of cell death after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study tested the hypothesis that cytochrome c and activated caspase-9 are released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after severe TBI and that their presence correlates with mitochondrial injury and severity of neurologic outcome., METHODS: Nine adult patients with severe TBI (GCS < or = 8) underwent placement of intraventricular catheters for monitoring and management of intracranial pressure. CSF was sampled at catheter insertion (2-26 h after injury) and at intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h thereafter. Control samples were obtained from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia (ASA1). CSF levels of cytochrome c and activated caspase-9 were measured using ELISA., RESULTS: Cytochrome c was detected in 18 (51.4%) samples, in the range of 0.08-5 ng/ml; mean value for cytochrome c was 0.44 ng/ml (SD +/- 0.632). Activated caspase-9 was detected in 10 samples (28.6%); mean value was 0.28 ng/ml (SD +/- 0.39). R (s) between cytochrome c and Glasgow outcome score (GOS) was -0.25 (P = 0.14), and between GOS and activated caspase-9 was -0.35 (P = 0.04). R calculated based on linear regression of activated caspase-9 and cytochrome c concentrations was 0.18. Control CSF samples had no detectable levels of either marker (detection level for cytochrome c was 0.08 ng/ml and 0.20 for activated caspase-9)., CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that activated caspase-9 and cytochrome c are present in the CSF of patients with severe TBI.

Role of extracellular glutamate measured by cerebral microdialysis in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Chamoun, Roukoz; Suki, Dima; Gopinath, Shankar P; Goodman, J Clay; Robertson, Claudia","OBJECT: Authors of several studies have implied a key role of glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the place of glutamate measurement in clinical practice and its impact on the management of TBI has yet to be elucidated. The authors' objective in the present study was to evaluate glutamate levels in TBI, analyzing the factors affecting them and determining their prognostic value., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with severe TBI was conducted with an inclusion criterion of a Glasgow Coma Scale score  20 micromol/L, compared with 18% among those with levels < or = 20 micromol/L. Two general patterns were recognized: Pattern 1, glutamate levels tended to normalize over the monitoring period (120 hours); and Pattern 2, glutamate levels tended to increase with time or remain abnormally elevated. Patients showing Pattern 1 had a lower mortality rate (17.1 vs 39.6%) and a better 6-month functional outcome among survivors (41.2 vs 20.7%)., CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate levels measured by microdialysis appear to have an important role in TBI.

Transfusions and long-term functional outcomes in traumatic brain injury.,"Warner, Matthew A; O'Keeffe, Terence; Bhavsar, Premal; Shringer, Rashmi; Moore, Carol; Harper, Caryn; Madden, Christopher J; Sarode, Ravi; Gentilello, Larry M; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon","OBJECT: In this paper, the authors' goal was to examine the relationship between transfusion and long-term functional outcomes in moderately anemic patients (lowest hematocrit [HCT] level 21-30%) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). While evidence suggests that transfusions are associated with poor hospital outcomes, no study has examined transfusions and long-term functional outcomes in this population. The preferred transfusion threshold remains controversial., METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who were admitted with TBI between September 2005 and November 2007, extracting data such as HCT level, status of red blood cell transfusion, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, serum glucose, and length of hospital stay. Outcome measures assessed at 6 months were Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score, Functional Status Examination score, and patient death. A multivariate generalized linear model controlling for confounding variables was used to assess the association between transfusion and outcome., RESULTS: During the study period, 292 patients were identified, and 139 (47.6%) met the criteria for moderate anemia. Roughly half (54.7%) underwent transfusions. Univariate analyses showed significant correlations between outcome score and patient age, admission GCS score, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, number of days with an HCT level < 30%, highest glucose level, number of days with a glucose level > 200 mg/dl, length of hospital stay, number of patients receiving a transfusion, and transfusion volume. In multivariate analysis, admission GCS score, receiving a transfusion, and transfusion volume were the only variables associated with outcome (F = 2.458, p = 0.007; F = 11.694, p = 0.001; and F = 1.991, p = 0.020, respectively).

Predictive utility of weekly post-traumatic amnesia assessments after brain injury: A multicentre analysis.,"Brown, Allen W; Malec, James F; Mandrekar, Jay; Diehl, Nancy N; Dikmen, Sureyya S; Sherer, Mark; Hart, Tessa; Novack, Thomas A","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To consider the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) as a single predictor variable to determine whether categories of PTA duration exist that predict 1-year outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., RESEARCH DESIGN: Using the TBI Model System database (n = 5250), the duration of PTA that predicts 1-year outcomes was calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine whether a single predictive threshold value existed. Classification and regression tree analysis then determined whether multiple threshold values existed. The area under the ROC curve and percentage correct classification were also calculated to discriminate classification accuracy and choose the best predictive thresholds., RESULTS: A single threshold value of PTA days was identified for all variables. At 1 year, PTA that extended into week 7 after injury predicted total FIM and FIM sub-scales. One-year employment and global outcomes were predicted by PTA extending into week 4 after injury.

However, the predictive validity of these variables has never been rigorously tested in patients from the developing world. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of these variables in a resource-limited setting and to test their predictive power by using them to create an outcome model., METHODS: : The study was conducted at Hospital Emergencias ""Dr. Clemente Alvarez"" in Rosario, Argentina. All patients with severe TBI meeting criteria between August 2000 and February 2003 were included. Outcome at 6 months postinjury was measured by mortality and by the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Two logistic regression models were created for predicting mortality and outcome., RESULTS: : Outcome measures were acquired for 100% of the sample (N = 148). There was 58% mortality; 30% had moderate to good recovery, and 12% were severely disabled. The model accurately predicted 83.9% of mortality, and 81.1% of outcome. Because of variation in timing of CT scans, the models were recalculated without the CT variable. The accuracy of prediction was 79.7% and 79% for mortality and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : This study provides rigorous, prospective data that (1) validates the generalizability of the five World Health Organization/Organization Mondiale de la Sante TBI prognostic predictors outside of the developed world, and (2) provides outcome benchmarks for mortality and morbidity from severe TBI in developing countries.",2010,/,The Journal of trauma,68,3,564-70,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e3181ce1eed,20220417,#9684,Petroni 2010,,yes

Clinical and CT scan were taken at admission. S100beta concentration was quantified at admission and 24, 48 and 72 hours post-TBI (days 0, 1, 2 and 3). Outcome was assessed 12 months after discharge using Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS)., RESULTS: Significant negative correlations were found between 1-year GOS and S100beta concentrations on days 1-3, but not on day 0. Deceased patients showed higher S100beta concentration than survivors on days 1-3. Good (GOS = 4-5) vs poor outcome (GOS = 1-3) differed significantly on day 3. Death outcome was independently predicted by day 2 (>2.37 microg l(-1)), day 3 (>1.41 microg l(-1)) samples and absence of pupillary reaction. Poor outcome was predicted independently only by pupillary reaction and the 72-hour sample (>1.1 microg l(-1)), but this predictive model was less satisfactory than the predictive model for death., CONCLUSIONS: A temporal profile of S100beta release from admission to 72 hours post-TBI is strongly recommended for use in identifying patients at risk of developing a worse outcome.

Dysautonomia after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Hendricks, H T; Heeren, A H; Vos, P E","BACKGROUND: Dysautonomia after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is characterized by episodes of increased heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, muscle tone, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, and profuse sweating. This study addresses the incidence of dysautonomia after severe TBI, the clinical variables that are associated with dysautonomia, and the functional outcome of patients with dysautonomia., METHODS: A historic cohort study in patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < or = 8 on admission]., RESULTS: Seventy-six of 119 patients survived and were eligible for follow-up. The incidence of dysautonomia was 11.8%. Episodes of dysautonomia were prevalent during a mean period of 20.1 days (range 3-68) and were often initiated by discomfort. Patients with dysautonomia showed significant longer periods of coma (24.78 vs. 7.99 days) and mechanical ventilation (22.67 vs. 7.21 days). Dysautonomia was associated with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) [relative risk (RR) 20.83, CI 4.92-83.33] and the development of spasticity (RR 16.94, CI 3.96-71.42). Patients with dysautonomia experienced more secondary complications. They tended to have poorer outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Dysautonomia occurs in approximately 10% of patients surviving severe TBI and is associated with DAI and the development of spasticity at follow-up.

Neuroglobin genetic polymorphisms and their relationship to functional outcomes after traumatic brain injury.,"Chuang, Pei-Ying; Conley, Yvette P; Poloyac, Samuel M; Okonkwo, David O; Ren, Dianxu; Sherwood, Paula R; Hravnak, Marilyn; Alexander, Sheila A","Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, to date an association between genetic variation within the human neuroglobin (NGB) gene and recovery post-TBI has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between NGB genotypes and outcomes (as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS], the Disability Rating Scale [DRS], and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised [NRS-R]) after severe TBI. Genotyping using TaqMan allele discrimination for two tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) that represent the two haplotype blocks for NGB (rs3783988 and rs10133981) was completed on DNA obtained from 196 Caucasian patients recovering from severe TBI. Patients were dichotomized based on the presence of the variant allele for each tSNP. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare characteristics between groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine NGB tSNPs and recovery from severe TBI. Subjects with the TT genotype (wild-type) for rs3783988 were more likely to have better GOS and DRS scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, while rs10133981 genotype was not significantly related to functional outcome. After controlling for age, gender, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, those subjects with the rs3783988 TT genotype had more than a 2.65-times greater likelihood of better functional outcomes than individuals with genotypes harboring a variant allele.

Among patients who received PbtO(2)-directed therapy, mortality was associated with lower mean daily PbtO(2) (p < 0.05), longer durations of compromised brain oxygen (PbtO(2) < 20 mm Hg, p = 0.013) and brain hypoxia (PbtO(2) < 15 mm Hg, p = 0.001), more episodes and a longer cumulative duration of compromised PbtO(2) (p < 0.001), and less successful treatment of compromised PbtO(2) (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PbtO(2)-based therapy, particularly when compromised PbtO(2) can be corrected, may be associated with reduced patient mortality and improved patient outcome after severe TBI.",2010,/,Journal of neurosurgery,113,3,571-80,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2010.1.JNS09506,20415526,#9647,Spiotta 2010,,yes

Impact of age on long-term cognitive function after traumatic brain injury.,"Senathi-Raja, Dawn; Ponsford, Jennie; Schonberger, Michael","OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of age and time postinjury with cognitive outcome 5-22 years following traumatic brain injury (TBI), in relation to matched uninjured controls., METHODS: One hundred twelve participants with mild to very severe TBI, aged 16-81 years at the time of injury, were cognitively assessed on measures of processing speed and attention, verbal and visual memory, executive function, and working memory. Results were compared with those of 112 healthy controls individually matched for current age, gender, education, and estimated IQ., RESULTS: Older injured individuals performed worse than did younger injured individuals across all cognitive domains, after controlling for the performance of controls. In relation to matched controls, long-time survivors performed disproportionately worse than did more recently injured individuals, irrespective of age., CONCLUSIONS: After maximum spontaneous recovery from TBI, poorer cognitive functioning appears to be associated with both older age at the time of injury and increased time postinjury.

YKL-40 expression in traumatic brain injury: an initial analysis.,"Bonneh-Barkay, Dafna; Zagadailov, Pavel; Zou, Huichao; Niyonkuru, Christian; Figley, Matthew; Starkey, Adam; Wang, Guoji; Bissel, Stephanie J; Wiley, Clayton A; Wagner, Amy K","YKL-40 (chitinase 3-like protein 1) is expressed in a broad spectrum of inflammatory conditions and cancers. We have previously reported that YKL-40 levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of macaques and humans with lentiviral encephalitis, as well as multiple sclerosis (MS). The current study assessed temporal CSF YKL-40 levels in subjects with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score <or=8). We also evaluated temporal expression of YKL-40 after parasagittal controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury over the parietal cortex (2.8 mm deep, 4 m/sec). We demonstrate that CSF YKL-40 levels are elevated after acute TBI, and that YKL-40 levels are higher in patients who died following injury than in patients who survived. YKL-40 levels significantly correlate with CSF levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). After CCI, in situ hybridization (ISH) showed that YKL-40 transcription is primarily associated with reactive astrocytes in pericontusional cortex. Tissue YKL-40 transcription time course analysis after CCI showed that YKL40 transcription in astrocytes began 1 day after injury, remained elevated for several days, and then declined by day 12. Similarly to our temporal CSF measurements in humans, YKL-40 induction after CCI is coincident with IL-1beta expression. Taken together these findings demonstrate that YKL-40 is induced in astrocytes during acute neuroinflammation, is temporally related to inflammatory mediator expression, and may be a useful biomarker for understanding secondary injury and for patient prognosis.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,7,1215-23,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1310,20486806,#9619,Bonneh-Barkay 2010,,yes
Intensive care cost and survival analyses of traumatic brain injury.,"Sut, Necdet; Memis, Dilek","BACKGROUND: Intensive care of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost; however, there is very little published work on this topic. The purpose of this study was to examine direct costs and survival outcomes of patients with TBI admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)., METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of Trakya University Hospital's ICU from 2002-2006 was undertaken. Patients with TBI were determined and assessed regarding costs and survival., RESULTS: The study group consisted of 126 patients, and 27.8% of them had been operated. Male gender (80.2%) was dominant, mean length of stay was 9.8+/-8.7 days, and motor vehicle injury (59.5%) was the major reason for ICU admission. Mortality rate was 50% and the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of the patients was 6.1+/-1.9. The average cost per ICU stay was US$ 4846+/-5084. Cost per life saved and per life-year saved were US$ 9533 and US$ 313.60, respectively. Survival rates were significantly different among injury types (p=0.010). GCS appeared to be a prognostic parameter in patient survival (Hazard Ratio: 0.643; 95%CI: 0.529-0.781; p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Intensive care of TBI cases is characterized by high mortality and high cost.",2010,/,Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,16,2,149-54,,,20517770,#9604,Sut 2010,,yes

Two reviewers independently performed the selection and quality assessment. A best- evidence synthesis was performed for prognostic factors assessed in 2 or more studies., RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included, 27 of which were high quality. Most studies used the Glasgow Outcome Score at 6 months post-injury as outcome measure, sometimes in combination with other outcome measures. Strong evidence for predicting outcome at 6 months was found for the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), GCS admission, motor score, midline shift on computed tomography scan, subdural haematoma and pulsatility index. Strong evidence of no association was found for gender and intraventricular haemorrhage.

Heart rate and pulse pressure variability are associated with intractable intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Kahraman, Sibel; Dutton, Richard P; Hu, Peter; Stansbury, Lynn; Xiao, Yan; Stein, Deborah M; Scalea, Thomas M","Calculation of integer heart rate variability (HRVi) permits monitoring over extended periods. We asked whether continuous monitoring of HRVi or integer pulse pressure (PP) variability (PPVi) could predict intracranial hypertension, defined as ICP >20 mm Hg, cerebral hypoperfusion, defined as CPP<60 mm Hg, mortality or functional outcome after severe traumatic brain injury. Dense integer data collected during continuous intensive care unit monitoring for periods of 1 to 11 days on 25 patients admitted to our Level I trauma center with Glasgow Coma Scale <9 provided 1,715,000 data points over a mean 106+/-62 hours. PP, HRVi, and PPVi increased in response to increasing ICP when CPP >60 mm Hg (P<0.001), but HRVi and PPVi decreased when CPP <60 mm Hg and P<50 mm Hg, even with ICP <20 mm Hg (P<0.001). ICP up to 40 mm Hg still evoked an increase in HRVi and PPVi (P<0.001), but both were suppressed with CPP <50 mm Hg and ICP >40 mm Hg (actual or impending brain death).

Automated assessment of midline shift in head injury patients.,"Xiao, Furen; Liao, Chun-Chih; Huang, Ke-Chun; Chiang, I-Jen; Wong, Jau-Min","OBJECTIVES: Midline shift (MLS) is an important quantitative feature for evaluating severity of brain compression by various pathologies, including traumatic intracranial hematomas. In this study, we sought to determine the accuracy and the prognostic value of our computer algorithm that automatically measures the MLS of the brain on computed tomography (CT) images in patients with head injury., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Modelling the deformed midline into three segments, we had designed an algorithm to estimate the MLS automatically. We retrospectively applied our algorithm to the initial CT images of 53 patients with head injury to determine the automated MLS (aMLS) and validated it against that measured by human (hMLS). Both measurements were separately used to predict the neurological outcome of the patients., RESULTS: The hMLS ranged from 0 to 30 mm. It was greater than 5 mm in images of 17 patients (32%). In 49 images (92%), the difference between hMLS and aMLS was <1 mm. To detect MLS >5 mm, our algorithm achieved sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100%. For mortality prediction, aMLS was no worse than hMLS., CONCLUSION: In summary, automated MLS was accurate and predicted outcome as well as that measured manually.

This is a retrospective cohort study of severe TBI patients receiving PBC at Level I Trauma Center and tertiary university hospital., METHODS: Four thousand nine hundred thirty-four patients were admitted to the trauma intensive care unit with severe TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale >or= 3) between April 1998 and December 2004. Six hundred eleven received intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and 58 received PBC. Three patients underwent craniotomy for intracranial mass lesion and were excluded. The study group received standardized medical management for severe TBI including opiates, benzodiazepines, elevation of the head of bed, avoidance of hypotension and hypercapnia and hyperosmolar therapy (HOsmRx). In addition, 31 of 55 patients (56%) underwent placement of intraventricular catheters for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. If routine medical management and cerebrospinal fluid diversion failed to control ICP, then the patient was determined to have refractory intracranial hypertension (RICH) and PBC treatment was initiated. PBC was performed with pentobarbital infusion with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring to ensure adequate burst suppression. The measurements include serum sodium (Na) and osmolality (Osm) were assessed as indicators for initiation of PBC and to estimate the 50% mortality cut-points when controlling for ICP. Follow-up functional outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale and stratified according to admission Glasgow Coma Scale score and Marshall computed tomography classification. Of the 55 PBC patients, 22 (40%) survived at discharge. 19 of 22 had long-term follow-up (1 year or more) available. Of these, 13 (68%) were normal or functionally independent (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or 5). Serum Na and Osm were associated with death (p < 0.05) when controlling for ICP. The 50% mortality cut-points were Na of 160 mEq/L and Osm of 330 mOsm/kg H2O. Median minimum cerebral perfusion pressure after PBC was 42 mm Hg in survivors and 34 mm Hg in nonsurvivors (p = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe TBI and RICH, survival at discharge of 40% with good functional outcomes in 68% of survivors at 1 year or more can be achieved with PBC after failure of HOsmRx. Based on 50% mortality cut-points, analysis suggests the limits of HOsmRx to be Na of 160 mEq/L and Osm of 330 mOsm/Kg H2O.

Cognitive and behavioral impairment in traumatic brain injury related to outcome and return to work.,"Benedictus, Marieke R; Spikman, Jacoba M; van der Naalt, Joukje","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cognitive and behavioral disturbances related to return to work (RTW) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the application of a differentiated outcome scale., DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study., SETTING: Level I trauma center., PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N=434) with TBI of various severity., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), Differentiated Outcome Scale (DOS), and RTW., RESULTS: Patients encountered problems in the physical (40%), cognitive (62%), behavioral (55%), and social domains (49%) of the DOS, with higher frequency related to severity of injury. Even those with mild TBI experienced cognitive (43%) and behavioral problems (33%). Patients with good recovery (58%) according to the GOS-E experienced problems in 1 or more domains of the DOS. Half the patients were able to resume previous vocational activities completely, although 1 in 3 experienced cognitive or behavioral problems. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the cognitive (odds ratio [OR], 10.548; confidence interval [CI], 5.99-18.67), behavioral (OR, 2.648; CI, 1.63-4.29), and physical domains (OR, 2.763; CI, 1.60-4.78) were significant (P<.01) predictors of RTW. For subcategories of TBI, the cognitive domain was predictive for RTW in those with moderate and severe TBI, whereas both the cognitive and behavioral domains were predictive for RTW in those with mild TBI., CONCLUSIONS: With application of a more detailed outcome scale, cognitive and behavioral impairments interfering with RTW were present in a substantial part of patients with TBI in the chronic phase after injury.

The effect of spontaneous alterations in brain temperature on outcome: a prospective observational cohort study in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Sacho, Raphael H; Vail, Andy; Rainey, Timothy; King, Andrew T; Childs, Charmaine","There are few prospective studies reporting the effect of spontaneous temperature changes on outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Where studies have been conducted, results are based on systemic rather than brain temperature per se. However, body temperature is not a reliable surrogate for brain temperature. Consequently, the effect of brain temperature changes on outcome in the acute phase after TBI is not clear. Continuous intraparenchymal brain temperature was measured in consecutive admissions of severe TBI patients during the course of the first 5 days of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients received minimal temperature altering therapy during their ICU stay. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the initial, the 24-h mean, and the 48-h mean brain temperature with outcome for mortality at 30 days and outcome at 3 months. Multifactorial analysis was performed to account for potential confounders. At the 24-h time point, brain temperature within the range of 36.5degreeC to 38degreeC was associated with a lower probability of death (10-20%). Brain temperature outside of this range was associated with a higher probability of death and poor 3-month neurological outcome. After adjusting for other predictors of outcome, low brain temperature was independently associated with a worse outcome. Lower brain temperatures (below 37degreeC) are independently associated with a higher mortality rate after severe TBI. The results suggest that, contrary to current opinion, temperatures within the normal to moderate fever range during the acute post-TBI period do not impose an additional risk for a poor outcome after severe TBI.",2010,/,Journal of neurotrauma,27,12,2157-64,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2010.1384,20822465,#9529,Sacho 2010,,yes

However, it is not known whether using the standard independent predictors in conjunction with coagulation tests would improve their prognostic value. We determined the incidence of TBI-associated coagulopathy in patients with isolated TBI (iTBI), evaluated the prognostic value of coagulation tests for in-hospital mortality, and tested their predictive power for in-hospital mortality in patients with iTBI., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational database study on 2319 consecutive patients with iTBI who attended the Huashan Hospital Department of the Neurosurgery Neurotrauma Center at Fudan University in China between December 2004 and June 2015. Two models based on the admission characteristics were developed: model A included predictors such as age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupil reactivity, type of injury, and hemoglobin and glucose levels, while model B included the predictors from model A as well as coagulation test results. A total of 1643 patients enrolled between December 2004 and December 2011 were used to derive the prognostic models, and 676 patients enrolled between January 2012 and June 2015 were used to validate the models., RESULTS: Overall, 18.6% (n = 432) of the patients developed coagulopathy after iTBI. The prevalence of acute traumatic coagulopathy is associated with the severity of brain injury. The percentage of platelet count <100 x 109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.25, the prothrombin time (PT) > 14 s, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 36 s, D-dimer >5 mg/L and fibrinogen (FIB) < 1.5 g/L was also closely related to the severity of brain injury, significance being found among three groups.

Prognostic significance of optic nerve sheath diameter on computed tomography scan with severity of blunt traumatic brain injury in the emergency department.,"Waheed, Shahan; Baig, Muhammad Akbar; Siddiqui, Emaduddin; Jamil, Danyal; Bashar, Masharib; Feroze, Asher","Optic nerve sheath diameter measurement (ONSD) has been associated with identifying the prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The study was planned to evaluate the prognostic value of ONSD measured on the initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan performed on patients with blunt TBI in the emergency department(ED). This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised data of moderate and severe TBI patients from January to December 2014. ONSD for each eye on the initial CT scan and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was measured upon patient presentation. Correlation between presentation GCS and ONSD was done through Pearson's correlation. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was done to measure the predictive values of ONSD for mortality. Of the 276 patients, 211(76%) were males and 65(23%) females. ONSD was measured on 160(58%) patients. The mean ONSD measured on CT scan was 3.8+/-1.

Predicting Long-Term Global Outcome after Traumatic Brain Injury: Development of a Practical Prognostic Tool Using the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Database.,"Walker, William C; Stromberg, Katharine A; Marwitz, Jennifer H; Sima, Adam P; Agyemang, Amma A; Graham, Kristin M; Harrison-Felix, Cynthia; Hoffman, Jeanne M; Brown, Allen W; Kreutzer, Jeffrey S; Merchant, Randall","For patients surviving serious traumatic brain injury (TBI), families and other stakeholders often desire information on long-term functional prognosis, but accurate and easy-to-use clinical tools are lacking. We aimed to build utilitarian decision trees from commonly collected clinical variables to predict Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) functional levels at 1, 2, and 5 years after moderate-to-severe closed TBI. Flexible classification tree statistical modeling was used on prospectively collected data from the TBI-Model Systems (TBIMS) inception cohort study. Enrollments occurred at 17 designated, or previously designated, TBIMS inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Analysis included all participants with nonpenetrating TBI injured between January 1997 and January 2017. Sample sizes were 10,125 (year-1), 8,821 (year-2), and 6,165 (year-5) after cross-sectional exclusions (death, vegetative state, insufficient post-injury time, and unavailable outcome). In our final models, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration consistently dominated branching hierarchy and was the lone injury characteristic significantly contributing to GOS predictability. Lower-order variables that added predictability were age, pre-morbid education, productivity, and occupational category. Generally, patient outcomes improved with shorter PTA, younger age, greater pre-morbid productivity, and higher pre-morbid vocational or educational achievement. Across all prognostic groups, the best and worst good recovery rates were 65.7% and 10.9%, respectively, and the best and worst severe disability rates were 3.9% and 64.1%. Predictability in test data sets ranged from C-statistic of 0.691 (year-1; confidence interval [CI], 0.675, 0.711) to 0.731 (year-2; CI, 0.724, 0.738). In conclusion, we developed a clinically useful tool to provide prognostic information on long-term functional outcomes for adult survivors of moderate and severe closed TBI. Predictive accuracy for GOS level was demonstrated in an independent test sample.

Simplifying the use of prognostic information in traumatic brain injury. Part 1: The GCS-Pupils score: an extended index of clinical severity.,"Brennan, Paul M; Murray, Gordon D; Teasdale, Graham M","Objective: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and pupil responses are key indicators of the severity of traumatic brain damage. The aim of this study was to determine what information would be gained by combining these indicators into a single index and to explore the merits of different ways of achieving this., Methods: METHODS Information about early GCS scores, pupil responses, late outcomes on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, and mortality were obtained at the individual patient level by reviewing data from the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury; n = 9,045) study and the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in TBI; n = 6855) database. These data were combined into a pooled data set for the main analysis. Methods of combining the Glasgow Coma Scale and pupil response data varied in complexity from using a simple arithmetic score (GCS score [range 3-15] minus the number of nonreacting pupils [0, 1, or 2]), which we call the GCS-Pupils score (GCS-P; range 1-15), to treating each factor as a separate categorical variable. The content of information about patient outcome in each of these models was evaluated using Nagelkerke's R2., Results: Separately, the GCS score and pupil response were each related to outcome. Adding information about the pupil response to the GCS score increased the information yield. The performance of the simple GCS-P was similar to the performance of more complex methods of evaluating traumatic brain damage. The relationship between decreases in the GCS-P and deteriorating outcome was seen across the complete range of possible scores. The additional 2 lowest points offered by the GCS-Pupils scale (GCS-P 1 and 2) extended the information about injury severity from a mortality rate of 51% and an unfavorable outcome rate of 70% at GCS score 3 to a mortality rate of 74% and an unfavorable outcome rate of 90% at GCS-P 1. The paradoxical finding that GCS score 4 was associated with a worse outcome than GCS score 3 was not seen when using the GCS-P., Conclusions: A simple arithmetic combination of the GCS score and pupillary response, the GCS-P, extends the information provided about patient outcome to an extent comparable to that obtained using more complex methods. The greater range of injury severities that are identified and the smoothness of the stepwise pattern of outcomes across the range of scores may be useful in evaluating individual patients and identifying patient subgroups. The GCS-P may be a useful platform onto which information about other key prognostic features can be added in a simple format likely to be useful in clinical practice.",2018,/,Journal of neurosurgery,128,6,1612-1620,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2017.12.JNS172780,29631516,#5700,Brennan 2018,,yes
Simplifying the use of prognostic information in traumatic brain injury. Part 2: Graphical presentation of probabilities.,"Murray, Gordon D; Brennan, Paul M; Teasdale, Graham M","OBJECTIVE Clinical features such as those included in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupil reactivity, and patient age, as well as CT findings, have clear established relationships with patient outcomes due to neurotrauma. Nevertheless, predictions made from combining these features in probabilistic models have not found a role in clinical practice. In this study, the authors aimed to develop a method of displaying probabilities graphically that would be simple and easy to use, thus improving the usefulness of prognostic information in neurotrauma. This work builds on a companion paper describing the GCS-Pupils score (GCS-P) as a tool for assessing the clinical severity of neurotrauma. METHODS Information about early GCS score, pupil response, patient age, CT findings, late outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, and mortality were obtained at the individual adult patient level from the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury; n = 9045) and IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in TBI; n = 6855) databases. These data were combined into a pooled data set for the main analysis. Logistic regression was first used to model the combined association between the GCS-P and patient age and outcome, following which CT findings were added to the models. The proportion of variability in outcomes ""explained"" by each model was assessed using Nagelkerke's R2. RESULTS The authors observed that patient age and GCS-P have an additive effect on outcome. The probability of mortality 6 months after neurotrauma is greater with increasing age, and for all age groups the probability of death is greater with decreasing GCS-P. Conversely, the probability of favorable recovery becomes lower with increasing age and lessens with decreasing GCS-P. The effect of combining the GCS-P with patient age was substantially more informative than the GCS-P, age, GCS score, or pupil reactivity alone. Two-dimensional charts were produced displaying outcome probabilities, as percentages, for 5-year increments in age between 15 and 85 years, and for GCS-Ps ranging from 1 to 15; it is readily seen that the movement toward combinations at the top right of the charts reflects a decreasing likelihood of mortality and an increasing likelihood of favorable outcome. Analysis of CT findings showed that differences in outcome are very similar between patients with or without a hematoma, absent cisterns, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Taken in combination, there is a gradation in risk that aligns with increasing numbers of any of these abnormalities. This information provides added value over age and GCS-P alone, supporting a simple extension of the earlier prognostic charts by stratifying the original charts in the following 3 CT groupings: none, only 1, and 2 or more CT abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS The important prognostic features in neurotrauma can be brought together to display graphically their combined effects on risks of death or on prospects for independent recovery. This approach can support decision making and improve communication of risk among health care professionals, patients, and their relatives. These charts will not replace clinical judgment, but they will reduce the risk of influences from biases.",2018,/,Journal of neurosurgery,128,6,1621-1634,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2017.12.JNS172782,29631517,#5699,Murray 2018,,yes
Regionally clustered ABCC8 polymorphisms in a prospective cohort predict cerebral oedema and outcome in severe traumatic brain injury.,"Jha, Ruchira Menka; Koleck, Theresa A; Puccio, Ava M; Okonkwo, David O; Park, Seo-Young; Zusman, Benjamin E; Clark, Robert S B; Shutter, Lori A; Wallisch, Jessica S; Empey, Philip E; Kochanek, Patrick M; Conley, Yvette P","OBJECTIVE: ABCC8 encodes sulfonylurea receptor 1, a key regulatory protein of cerebral oedema in many neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sulfonylurea-receptor-1 inhibition has been promising in ameliorating cerebral oedema in clinical trials. We evaluated whether ABCC8 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms predicted oedema and outcome in TBI., METHODS: DNA was extracted from 485 prospectively enrolled patients with severe TBI. 410 were analysed after quality control. ABCC8 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified (Hapmap, r2>0.8, minor-allele frequency >0.20) and sequenced (iPlex-Gold, MassArray). Outcomes included radiographic oedema, intracranial pressure (ICP) and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Proxy SNPs, spatial modelling, amino acid topology and functional predictions were determined using established software programs., RESULTS: Wild-type rs7105832 and rs2237982 alleles and genotypes were associated with lower average ICP (beta=-2.91, p=0.001; beta=-2.28, p=0.003) and decreased radiographic oedema (OR 0.42, p=0.012; OR 0.52, p=0.017). Wild-type rs2237982 also increased favourable 3-month GOS (OR 2.45, p=0.006); this was partially mediated by oedema (p=0.03). Different polymorphisms predicted 3-month outcome: variant rs11024286 increased (OR 1.84, p=0.006) and wild-type rs4148622 decreased (OR 0.40, p=0.01) the odds of favourable outcome. Significant tag and concordant proxy SNPs regionally span introns/exons 2-15 of the 39-exon gene., CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies four ABCC8 tag SNPs associated with cerebral oedema and/or outcome in TBI, tagging a region including 33 polymorphisms. In polymorphisms predictive of oedema, variant alleles/genotypes confer increased risk. Different variant polymorphisms were associated with favourable outcome, potentially suggesting distinct mechanisms. Significant polymorphisms spatially clustered flanking exons encoding the sulfonylurea receptor site and transmembrane domain 0/loop 0 (juxtaposing the channel pore/binding site). This, if validated, may help build a foundation for developing future strategies that may guide individualised care, treatment response, prognosis and patient selection for clinical trials.

Feasibility of Online Traumatic Brain Injury Prognostic Corticosteroids Randomisation After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) Model as a Predictor of Mortality.,"Faried, Ahmad; Satriawan, Ferry C; Arifin, Muhammad Z","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality in many countries. According to the World Health Organization, traffic crashes are a leading cause of death, with 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2013. A 2013 global road safety report listed 68 low-to-middle income countries that had an increased mortality rate owing to traffic accidents. The aim of this study was to analyze feasibility of use of an online prognostic model from the Medical Research Council Corticosteroids Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) trial collaborators in our center., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of 229 patients with TBI who were admitted to the Neurosurgery Unit at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from July to December 2016., RESULTS: During the study period, 495 patients with TBI were admitted; 229 patients were included in the study. Several variables were analyzed using independent statistical methods before being included in the online CRASH calculator, including Glasgow Coma Scale score (P = 0.000), pupillary reaction to light (P = 0.000), major extracranial injury (P = 0.002), and interval following incidence (P = 0.000). Statistical analysis showed that the online CRASH prognostic model reliably predicted 14-day mortality rate (P = 0.000) with 91.6% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity., CONCLUSIONS: The online CRASH model is a good prognostic model that can be used for patients with TBI in many developing countries.

What Can Be Learned from Diffusion Tensor Imaging from a Large Traumatic Brain Injury Cohort?: White Matter Integrity and Its Relationship with Outcome.,"Castano Leon, Ana Maria; Cicuendez, Marta; Navarro, Blanca; Munarriz, Pablo M; Cepeda, Santiago; Paredes, Igor; Hilario, Amaya; Ramos, Ana; Gomez, Pedro Antonio; Lagares, Alfonso","Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) contributes significantly to mortality and morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its identification is still a diagnostic challenge because of the limitations of conventional imaging techniques to characterized it. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can indirectly identify areas of damaged white matter (WM) integrity by detecting water molecule diffusion alterations. Therefore, DTI may improve detection and description of TAI lesions after TBI. We have obtained DTI data from 217 patients with moderate to severe TBI acquired at a median of 19 days after TBI, and patient DTI metrics were compared with data obtained from 58 age-matched healthy controls. Region of interest (ROI) method was applied to obtain mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value in 28 WM fiber bundles susceptible to TAI. Our main results were that when we compared patients with controls, patients, regardless of TBI severity, showed significantly reduced mean FA in almost all ROI measured. We found statistically significant correlation between FA metrics and some demographic, clinical, and conventional imaging characteristics. Additionally, these FA metrics were highly associated with outcome assessed at hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 months after TBI. We conclude that FA reduction in the subacute stage after TBI assessed by DTI may be a useful prognostic factor for long-term unfavorable outcome.",2018,/,Journal of neurotrauma,35,20,2365-2376,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5691,29786464,#5644,CastanoLeon 2018,,yes
The 90-day prognostic value of serum cyclophilin A in traumatic brain injury.,"Jin, Hang-Huang; Mao, Tian-Ming; Bai, Zhi-Qiang; Chen, Yuan; Ji, Hai-Long; Jin, Yong","BACKGROUND: Cyclophilin A is involved in many inflammatory diseases and its expression is up-regulated after brain injury. We determined if serum cyclophilin A could be used as a marker for severity and 90-day outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Serum cyclophilin A concentrations were quantified in 105 severe TBI patients and 105 healthy individuals. Its association with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 90-day mortality and 90-day poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) were investigated., RESULTS: Serum cyclophilin A concentrations were significantly higher in TBI patients than in healthy individuals. Cyclophilin A concentrations had a close relation to GCS scores and showed a high discriminatory ability for 90-day mortality and poor outcome according to area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Its AUC was in the range of GCS scores. Moreover, its combination with GCS scores significantly improved the predictive performance of GCS scores alone. In addition, serum cyclophilin A emerged as an independent predictor for 90-day mortality, overall survival and poor outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum cyclophilin A concentrations could reflect trauma severity and unfavorable outcome after head trauma, substantializing cyclophilin A as a potential biomarker for prognostic prediction of TBI.

Characteristics and prognosis of patients admitted to a hospital emergency department for traumatic brain injury and with anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment.,"Yuguero, Oriol; Guzman, Marianela; Castan, Teresa; Forne, Carles; Galindo, Gisela; Pujol, Jesus","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality and complications of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment in a hospital emergency department., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study of hospital cohorts of the 243 patients who attended with pure TBI to the emergency service of the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital in Lleida between June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. Sociodemographic, clinical and other variables related to clinical management were collected. Presence of complications and in-hospital mortality were registered at 24hours, at 48hours and one week after TBI., RESULTS: Overall, 50.2% of patients were men, with median age of 80.8years, and without CT-scan findings at admission in 62.3% of cases. A total of 14 patients died (5.8%). Overall mortality was associated with comorbidity, with knowledge loss and with fluctuation of the Glasgow comma scale in the acute process. Patients treated with anticoagulants (39.5%) or antiplatelet agents (33.3%) were older, with higher degree of dependency and more comorbidity, but did not present more complications. Without reaching statistical significance, higher mortality was observed during the first week in anticoagulated patients (7.3% vs 4.8%, P=.585) or with antiplatelet treatment (8.6% vs 4.3%, P=.241) with respect to those not treated., CONCLUSIONS: No worse results have been observed in number of complications in patients with TBI treated with anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment, so clinical management seems appropriate. The higher mortality could be explained by the greater complexity of these patients. It would be necessary to carry out more studies, preferably prospective with follow-up after discharge, in order to establish causal mechanisms between clinical management and mortality or associated complications to TBI.

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in moderate to severe head injured patients: Pure DAI vs. non-pure DAI.,"Kim, Moinay; Ahn, Jae Sung; Park, Wonhyoung; Hong, Suk Kyung; Jeon, Sang Ryong; Roh, Sung Woo; Lee, Seungjoo","OBJECTIVE: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is known to be associated with poor outcome. DAI often associates with other intracranial injuries but their distinct features have not been established. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared clinical outcomes between pure and non-pure DAI patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Total of 1047 traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients visited our institute between 2011 and 2017. Age ranged between 15-85 years old and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score less than 13 were included. DAI was diagnosed in 45 patients using CT and MRI and their clinical features and outcomes were compared depending on their associated cranial injury; 20 patients without evidence of associated injury (Pure DAI group) and other 25 patients with associated injury (Non-pure DAI group). DAI stage was adopted using Gentry, L.R., CLASSIFICATION: Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) was measured at least 6 months after trauma to evaluate their functional outcome., RESULTS: The mean age and follow-up period were 45.36 years and 15.09 months, respectively. There were no significant differences between pure and non-pure DAI groups regarding demographic data and clinical findings on their admission. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between GOS and clinical factors. In this analysis, pure DAI was no significantly different to non-pure DAI (p=0.607). However, DAI Stage, transfusion, and hypotension on admission were strongly related to poor outcome. Stage III showed sevenfold higher risk when compared to Stage I (p=0.010). The risk was also high when Stage III was compare to Stage I and II (p=0.002). Interestingly, no significant difference was observed between Stage I and II (p=0.847)., CONCLUSIONS: Unfavorable outcome was observed in 14 patients (31.11%) which was lower than we expected. Interestingly, non-pure DAI was no worse than pure DAI on their functional outcome. However, DAI Stage III was independently associated with poor outcome when compared to Stage I or I and II. Finally, we concluded that Stage II is clinically more related to Stage I, rather than Stage III. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in Candidate Traumatic Brain Injury Biomarker Genes Are Associated with Gross Neurological Outcomes after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Osier, Nicole D; Conley, Yvette P; Okonkwo, David O; Puccio, Ava M","Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are actively being pursued; potential candidates include glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), two of which the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved for marketing of blood tests for adult concussion. The relationship between biomarker-encoding genes and TBI outcomes remains unknown. This pilot study explores variation in 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in biomarker-encoding genes as predictors of neurological outcome in a population of adults with severe TBI. Participants (n = 305) were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. Multivariate logistical regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and determine the odds of having a lower score on the GOS ( = 1-2 vs. 3-5) based on variant allele presence, while controlling for confounders.

Clinical and Basic Evaluation of the Prognostic Value of Uric Acid in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Liu, Han; He, Junchi; Zhong, Jianjun; Zhang, Hongrong; Zhang, Zhaosi; Liu, Liu; Huang, Zhijian; Wu, Yue; Jiang, Li; Guo, Zongduo; Xu, Rui; Chai, Weina; Huo, Gang; Sun, Xiaochuan; Cheng, Chongjie","Background: As a major antioxidant in serum, uric acid (UA) was once considered only as the leading cause of gout; however, recent studies have validated its neuroprotective role in ischemic stroke. Because the potential protective effects of UA in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain largely unknown, this study investigated the role of UA in TBI in both clinical patients and experimental animals. Methods: In TBI patients, serum UA concentrations were measured within 3 days after injury. Clinical outcomes at discharge were classified according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale: good outcome (4-5) and poor outcome (1-3). Risk factors for good outcome were identified via backward logistic regression analysis. For the animal study, a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model was established in mice. These mice were given UA at different doses intraperitoneally, and subsequent UA concentrations in mouse serum and brain tissue were determined. Neurological function, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, neuronal maintenance, cerebral blood flow, and lesion size were also assessed. Results: The serum UA level was significantly lower in TBI patients who had a good outcome (P<0.01), and low serum UA was an independent predictor of good outcome after TBI (P<0.01; odds ratio, 0.023; 95% confidence interval, 0.006-0.082). Consistently, decreased levels of serum UA were observed in both TBI patients and CCI animals (P<0.05), whereas the UA concentration was increased in CCI brain tissue (P<0.05). Administration of UA further increased the UA level in brain tissue as compared to that in control animals (P<0.05). Among the different doses administered, 16 mg/kg UA improved sensorimotor functional recovery, spatial learning, and memory in CCI mice (P<0.05). Moreover, oxidative stress and the inflammatory response were inhibited by UA treatment (P<0.05). UA treatment also improved neuronal maintenance and cortical blood flow (P<0.05) but not lesion size (P>0.05). Conclusions: UA acted to attenuate neuronal loss, cerebral perfusion impairment and neurological deficits in TBI mice through suppression of neuronal and vascular oxidative stress. Following TBI, active antioxidant defense in the brain may result in consumption of UA in the serum, and thus, a decreased serum UA level could be predictive of good clinical recovery.",2018,/,International journal of medical sciences,15,10,1072-1082,,https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijms.25799,30013449,#5585,Liu 2018,,yes
Effect of Hypernatremia on Outcomes After severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Nationwide Inpatient Sample analysis.,"Hoffman, Haydn; Jalal, Muhammad S; Chin, Lawrence S","OBJECTIVE: Induced hypernatremia is frequently used to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This technique is controversial, and some studies have independently associated hypernatremia with worse outcomes after TBI. We sought to investigate this potential association in a large healthcare database., METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to obtain data on all adults who had been discharged from 2002 to 2011 with a primary diagnosis of TBI who required mechanical ventilation, intracranial pressure monitoring, or craniotomy/craniectomy. Patients with diabetes insipidus were excluded. The patients with hypernatremia were assigned to the hypernatremia group, and the rest were assigned to the control group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes included the length of stay, nonroutine hospital discharge, total hospital charges, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy placement., RESULTS: A total of 85,579 patients without a diagnosis of hypernatremia (control group) and 4542 patients with a diagnosis of hypernatremia (hypernatremia group) were identified. When controlling for age, comorbidities, gender, and cerebral edema, hypernatremia was associated with an increased rate of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.65), a longer mean length of stay (23.65 vs. 12.12 days; P < 0.001), an increased rate of nonroutine hospital discharge (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-2.92), and greater mean total hospital cost ($227,112 vs. $112,507; P < 0.001). The patients with hypernatremia also had greater rates of tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement., CONCLUSIONS: Hypernatremia was associated with poorer outcomes in patients with severe TBI.

Theory of mind in adults with traumatic brain injury: A meta-analysis,Lin X.; Zhang X.; Liu Q.; Zhao P.; Zhang H.; Wang H.; Yi Z. ,"Studies of abnormal theory of mind (ToM) performance in adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have reported inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to characterize ToM performance in adult patients with TBI. Random-effects models were employed to estimate the overall effect size and the differential effect sizes across different ToM aspects. Based on a sample of 28 studies (1031 patients and 865 healthy controls), the meta-analytic findings revealed that ToM was significantly impaired in adult patients with TBI compared to healthy controls (g = -1.13). Besides, patients with TBI showed significant impairments in individual ToM tasks, as well as for different stimulus modes and contents involved in these ToM tasks. A meta-regression indicated a positive association between ToM performance and Glasgow Coma Scale score. The results of the current meta-analysis suggest that the performance in ToM tasks may be a good predictor of functional outcomes in adults with TBI, which is important for the identification of targets for cognitive interventions and the development of useful training intervention programs.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)",2021,/,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,121,"(Lin, Zhang, Liu) Department of Neurology, Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Suqian, China(Zhao, Zhang, Yi) Department of Central Laboratory, Affiliated Yancheng Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Yancheng, China(Wa",106-118,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.12.010,2010464151,#19836,Lin 2021,,yes
Estimating prognosis for traumatic brain injury patients in a low-resource setting: How do providers compare to the CRASH risk calculator?,Elahi C.; Williamson T.; Spears C.A.; Williams S.; Najjuma J.N.; Staton C.A.; Vissoci J.R.N.; Fuller A.; Kitya D.; Haglund M.M. ,"OBJECTIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a burgeoning global health concern, is one condition that could benefit from prognostic modeling. Risk stratification of TBI patients on presentation to a health facility can support the prudent use of limited resources. The CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury) model is a well-established prognostic model developed to augment complex decision-making. The authors' current study objective was to better understand in-hospital decision-making for TBI patients and determine whether data from the CRASH risk calculator influenced provider assessment of prognosis. METHODS The authors performed a choice experiment using a simulated TBI case. All participant doctors received the same case, which included a patient history, vitals, and physical examination findings. Half the participants also received the CRASH risk score. Participants were asked to estimate the patient prognosis and decide the best next treatment step. The authors recruited a convenience sample of 28 doctors involved in TBI care at both a regional and a national referral hospital in Uganda. RESULTS For the simulated case, the CRASH risk scores for 14-day mortality and an unfavorable outcome at 6 months were 51.4% (95% CI 42.8%, 59.8%) and 89.8% (95% CI 86.0%, 92.6%), respectively. Overall, participants were overoptimistic when estimating the patient prognosis. Risk estimates by doctors provided with the CRASH risk score were closer to that score than estimates made by doctors in the control group; this effect was more pronounced for inexperienced doctors. Surgery was selected as the best next step by 86% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS This study was a novel assessment of a TBI prognostic model's influence on provider estimation of risk in a low-resource setting. Exposure to CRASH risk score data reduced overoptimistic prognostication by doctors, particularly among inexperienced providers.Copyright Â© 2021 American Association of Neurological Surgeons.

Neuroanatomical Substrates and Symptoms Associated with Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,Richter S.; Winzeck S.; Kornaropoulos E.N.; Das T.; Vande Vyvere T.; Verheyden J.; Williams G.B.; Correia M.M.; Menon D.K.; Newcombe V.F.J. ,"Importance: Persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represent a major public health problem. Objective(s): To identify neuroanatomical substrates of mTBI and the optimal timing for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This prospective multicenter cohort study encompassed all eligible patients from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study (December 19, 2014, to December 17, 2017) and a local cohort (November 20, 2012, to December 19, 2013). Patients presented to the hospital within 24 hours of an mTBI (Glasgow Coma Score, 13-15), satisfied local criteria for computed tomographic scanning, and underwent MRI scanning less than 72 hours (MR1) and 2 to 3 weeks (MR2) after injury. In addition, 104 control participants were enrolled across all sites. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Exposure: Mild TBI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Volumes and diffusion parameters were extracted via automated bespoke pipelines. Symptoms were measured using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire in the short term and the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months. Result(s): Among the 81 patients included in the analysis (73 CENTER-TBI and 8 local), the median age was 45 (interquartile range [IQR], 24-59; range, 14-85) years, and 57 (70.4%) were male. Structural sequences were available for all scans; diffusion data, for 73 MR1 and 79 MR2 scans. After adjustment for multiple comparisons between scans, visible lesions did not differ significantly, but cerebral white matter volume decreased (MR2:MR1 ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) and ventricular volume increased (MR2:MR1 ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10). White matter volume was within reference limits on MR1 scans (patient to control ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.01) and reduced on MR2 scans (patient to control ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Diffusion parameters changed significantly between scans in 13 tracts, following 1 of 3 trajectories. Symptoms measured by Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire scores worsened in the progressive injury phenotype (median, +5.00; IQR, +2.00 to +5.00]), improved in the minimal change phenotype (median, -4.50; IQR, -9.25 to +1.75), and were variable in the pseudonormalization phenotype (median, 0.00; IQR, -6.25 to +9.00) (P =.02). Recovery was favorable for 33 of 65 patients (51%) and was more closely associated with MR1 than MR2 (area under the curve, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.96] vs 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62-0.87]; P =.009). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that advanced MRI reveals potential neuroanatomical substrates of mTBI in white matter and is most strongly associated with odds of recovery if performed within 72 hours, although future validation is required.Copyright Â© 2021 American Medical Association.

Impact of immediate treatment within four days on prognosis in severe traumatic brain injury patients without vasospasm,Lin J.-F.; Tsai C.-C.; Tsai T.-H.; Chen Y.-J. ,"Background and objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with high mortality rate and long-term disability. Application of the Brain Trauma Foundation's ""Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury"" would reduce the prevalence of morbidity and mortality. However, the prevalence of some predictors of TBI have not been studied well with respect to the guidelines, for example, vasospasm. This study evaluated the correlation between the prognostic factors and outcome in patients without vasospasm. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients were treated as per the aforementioned guidelines. Ten patients were prospectively recruited and nine were examined by computed tomography angiography (CTA). The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was measured before and on the fourth postoperative day and was maintained at 3 60 mmHg. The results of Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) were collected after four weeks, three months, one year, and two years after admission. Result(s): There was no vasospasm noted in any of the assessed patients. Current results showed that the elderly (3 65 years) had poor GOS (5/6, 83.3%), whereas the younger group had better GOS (3/3, 100%) (p < 0.05). Lower GCS was associated with lower GOS. The subgroup with GCS  6 (p < 0.05) had a lower GOS. We also observed a better outcome when GCS was higher than 9 (3 10) (5/5, 100%) on the fourth postoperative day (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The use of CTA to evaluate vasospasm could be a reference while following the guidelines to manage patients with severe TBI. Aggressive treatment within the first four days could help in obtaining better brain resuscitation in severe TBI patients.Copyright Â© 2020, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.",2020,/,International Journal of Gerontology,14,2,142-145,,http://dx.doi.org/10.6890/IJGE.202005_14%282%29.0011,2008602854,#19827,Lin 2020,,yes
A physiology-driven machine learning model for traumatic brain injury outcome,Kim H.; Stevens R. ,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability adjusted life years worldwide. TBI prognostic scores such as the validated IMPACT and CRASH models may not capture available clinical and physiologic information to accurately determine the severity and outcome of TBI. The aim was to analyze data signatures of TBI patients in the first 24 hours of ICU admission, testing the hypothesis that these signatures predict mortality and neurological outcome at hospital discharge. METHOD(S): We identified 4,450 TBI ICU admissions for model development, and 346 for external validation, using the Philips eICU and MIMIC III databases, respectively. Variables extracted were quantitative data with emphasis on physiologic time series signals. The IMPACT and CRASH models were compared with three different machine learning (ML) algorithms, GLM, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (XGboost) trained and validated on a statistically pruned feature space of 147 derived variables. Model performance was determined with standard metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) discrimination analysis. RESULT(S): AUROC of IMPACT and CRASH for predicting neurological outcome at discharge was 0.77+/-0.03 and 0.77+/-0.02 respectively, and for predicting mortality was 0.87+/-0.03 and 0.86+/-0.03 respectively. Prediction performance of the GLM, RF, and XGboost ML models for neurological outcome was significantly higher (AUROC: 0.92+/-0.02, sensitivity: 0.87+/-0.02, specificity: 0.84+/-0.02) and similarly for prediction of mortality there was also a sizeable increase in performance (AUROC: 0.90+/-0.02, sensitivity: 0.82+/-0.04, specificity: 0.78+/-0.04). External validation utilizing MIMIC III corroborated our eICU results for both neurological outcome (AUROC: 0.91+/-0.01, sensitivity: 0.83+/-0.02, specificity: 0.83+/-0.03) and mortality prediction (AUROC: 0.92+/-0.01, sensitivity: 0.85+/-0.04, specificity: 0.82+/-0.04). CONCLUSION(S): Among patients in ICU for TBI, ML models integrating physiologic features from the first 24h after admission outperform reference IMPACT and CRASH models for the prediction of both neurological outcome and mortality. Results indicate that early physiologic time series features contain important prognostic information which may be overlooked in existing TBI prognostic systems.",2021,/,Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,655,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000731080.52234.16,634768016,#19825,Kim 2021,,yes
Platelet mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with functional recovery in patients with tbi,Jordan M.; Ekaney M.; Raddatz J.; Newman M.; Sealey L.; Wang H.; Evans S. ,"INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in traumatic brain injury (TBI) care, early prognostication of outcomes remains elusive. Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction predicts poor outcome but is not readily available. Platelet mitochondrial dysfunction (PMD) also occurs in TBI. We hypothesized that PMD would correlate with functional recovery. METHOD(S): Severe trauma patients (screening ISS >= 25) admitted to a Level 1 trauma center were divided into two cohorts based on the presence (ST+TBI, n=9) or absence (ST, n=10) of TBI. Age-matched healthy controls (HC, n=20) were drawn from the community. Platelet mitochondrial function, determined by oxygen consumption (OC), was measured with a 782 Strathkelvin Oxygen Meter. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was a screening test for cognitive impairment. The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) assessed community interaction at 6-month follow-up. Wilcoxon two-sample or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-hoc test and Spearman Correlation Coefficient were performed to check associations. Statistical significance: p < 0.05. RESULT(S): No difference existed between the cohorts for ISS (p = 0.68), ICU LOS (p = 0.07) and hospital LOS (p = 0.4). Mean OC on day 1 was higher in HC (5.81+/-1.96 mug/min) than ST (2.10+/-2.11 mug/min) and ST+TBI (0.86+/-1.66 mug/min, p < 0.05) and remained so through day 5. On the MMSE, HC (median = 30) and ST (median = 28.5) scored higher than STTBI (median = 16) at hospital discharge. At 6 months, there was no difference between the cohorts and HC for MMSE or CIQ. Correlation between change in OC and MMSE was 0.55. CONCLUSION(S): PMD in severe trauma patients is most pronounced in those with TBI and associated with poor cognitive function. Mitochondrial function and performance on measures of functional recovery improve with time.

"A comparison of glasgow coma scale score with ""full outline of unresponsiveness scale"" to predict outcome of the patients with traumatic brain injury presenting to emergency medicine department",Virani D.H.; Sangani S.V.; Patel C.J.; Dhusa D. ,"Introduction: In patients presenting to emergency department (ED) with traumatic brain injury, it is important to evaluate the neurological status to determine the present clinical status and to predict the outcome of the patient. GCS is the most widely used score, but it has some drawbacks which led to the development of other scores such as the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score. In our study, we compared the GCS and the FOUR scores in patients presenting with traumatic brain injury. Objective(s): *To compare the FOUR score with the GCS score in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. *To understand the effectiveness of the FOUR score as an assessment tool. *To assess whether the FOUR score is an alternative tool in TBI patients or could be complimentary. Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational study at a trauma center of B. J. Medical College, Ahmedabad between September 2019 and September 2020 of a total of 200 patients. All patients presenting with a clinical diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) were evaluated. A primary survey was done initially. Vitals of the patients were taken, and resuscitation started. Simultaneously, a GCS and a FOUR score were recorded by the emergency physician. All patients were evaluated in terms of TBI and relevant investigations were done, and findings were noted. We tabulated all information in Microsoft Excel 2019 and statistical analysis was done with SPSS software. Result(s): The mean age of study population was 38.295 +/- 15.33 years. Male patients were 79% and 21% were female patients. Road traffic accidents contributed highest percentages of causes of TBI (60%). Patients who were deceased had low GCS score and when GCS 8 was taken as the cut off value, sensitivity of GCS was 87.88% and specificity of GCS was 97.60%. With a positive predictive value of 87.8%; and when FOUR Score of 8 was the cut off value, sensitivity of FOUR score was 100% and Specificity was 97.52%, with a positive predictive value of 89.19%. By comparing the median value of FOUR score with mortality and the median value of GCS score with the mortality by using the Mann-Whitney test showed a p-value of >=1, which is statistically non-significant. Discussion(s): The Glasgow Coma Scale is an objective measurement of clinical status, as it correlates with the outcome, it is a reliable tool for interobserver measurements and is also effective for measuring patient recovery or on-going response to treatment. A minimum score is 3 (deep coma or death) and a maximum score is 15 (no neurological deficit). Three aspects of behavioral response namely eye-opening, verbal, and motor response are examined. All the above responses are tested after the application of a painful stimulus. The drawback of GCS is the failure to incorporate brainstem reflexes. The scale also includes a numerical bias toward the motor response and an important concern of issue is an appropriate application in intubated patients who cannot manifest a verbal response. GCS does not signify subtle changes in the neurological examination. Mayo Clinic, which evaluates four components, developed a new scale: eye, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and respiration, this is called the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score, each rated with a maximum score of four. A higher score indicates a better prognosis. The FOUR score, contrary to the GCS, avoids assessing verbal function. Conclusion(s): FOUR score is equally reliable with GCS score. Both have their own significance. FOUR score maintains simplicity and provides far better information, particularly for intubated patients. The FOUR score is a good predictor of the prognosis of critically ill patients.",2021,/,Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,25,SUPPL 1,S113-S114,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23711.193,634781833,#19817,Virani 2021,,yes
Predictive Value of Rotterdam Score and Marshall Score in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Contemporary Review,Mishra R.; Ucros H.E.V.; Florez-Perdomo W.A.; Suarez J.R.; Moscote-Salazar L.R.; Rahman M.M.; Agrawal A. ,"This article conducts a contemporary comparative review of the medical literature to update and establish evidence as to which framework among Rotterdam and Marshall computed tomography (CT)-based scoring systems predicts traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes better. The scheme followed was following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for literature search. The search started on August 15, 2020 and ended on December 31, 2020. The combination terms used were Medical Subject Headings terms, combination keywords, and specific words used for describing various pathologies of TBI to identify the most relevant article in each database. PICO question to guide the search strategy was: what is the use of Marshall (I) versus Rotterdam score (C) in TBI patients (P) for mortality risk stratification (O). The review is based on 46 references which included a full review of 14 articles for adult TBI patients and 6 articles for pediatric TBI articles comparing Rotterdam and Marshall CT scores. The review includes 8,243 patients, of which 2,365 were pediatric and 5,878 were adult TBI patients. Marshall CT classification is not ordinal, is more descriptive, has better inter-rater reliability, and poor performance in a specific group of TBI patients requiring decompressive craniectomy. Rotterdam CT classification is ordinal, has better discriminatory power, and a better description of the dynamics of intracranial changes. The two scoring systems are complimentary. A combination of clinical parameters, severity, ischemic and hemodynamic parameters, and CT scoring system could predict the prognosis of TBI patients with significant accuracy. None of the classifications has good evidence for use in pediatric patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Apache ii or incns to predict mortality in traumatic brain injury: A retrospective cohort study,Gursoy G.; Gursoy C.; Kuscu Y.; Demirbilek S.G. ,"BACKGROUND: Some scoring systems, such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), are used to predict mortality, but they are not specialized for traumatic brain injury. INCNS is a new scoring system for traumatic brain injury developed by Goa et al. INCNS score evaluates inflammation, nutrition, consciousness, neurological function and systemic condition. The present study aims to evaluate performances of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and INCNS to predict mortality in traumatic brain injuries. METHOD(S): In this study, 78 patients who were treated in anaesthesiology intensive care unit with the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury were included. Patients under the age of 18, foreigners, patients with incomplete data were excluded from this study. Medical records were examined retrospectively. APACHE II and INCNS scores in the first 24 hours were counted up. RESULT(S): Of the 78 patients, 45 (57.7%) were males and 33 (42.3%) were females. The overall mortality was 34.6% (27/78). The mean APACHE II, INCNS score was 23.85+/-9.44 and 14.43+/-8.75, respectively. The area under the curve result of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 0.797 for the APACHE II and 0.847 for the INCNS.

Outcome Prediction after Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: External Validation of Two Established Prognostic Models in 1742 European Patients,Dijkland S.A.; Helmrich I.R.A.R.; Nieboer D.; Van Der Jagt M.; Dippel D.W.J.; Menon D.K.; Stocchetti N.; Maas A.I.R.; Lingsma H.F.; Steyerberg E.W. ,"The International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) and Corticoid Randomisation After Significant Head injury (CRASH) prognostic models predict functional outcome after moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aimed to assess their performance in a contemporary cohort of patients across Europe. The Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core study is a prospective, observational cohort study in patients presenting with TBI and an indication for brain computed tomography. The CENTER-TBI core cohort consists of 4509 TBI patients available for analyses from 59 centers in 18 countries across Europe and Israel. The IMPACT validation cohort included 1173 patients with GCS <=12, age >=14, and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) available. The CRASH validation cohort contained 1742 patients with GCS <=14, age >=16, and 14-day mortality or 6-month GOSE available. Performance of the three IMPACT and two CRASH model variants was assessed with discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) and calibration (comparison of observed vs. predicted outcome rates). For IMPACT, model discrimination was good, with AUCs ranging between 0.77 and 0.85 in 1173 patients and between 0.80 and 0.88 in the broader CRASH selection (n = 1742). For CRASH, AUCs ranged between 0.82 and 0.88 in 1742 patients and between 0.66 and 0.80 in the stricter IMPACT selection (n = 1173). Calibration of the IMPACT and CRASH models was generally moderate, with calibration-in-the-large and calibration slopes ranging between-2.02 and 0.61 and between 0.48 and 1.39, respectively. The IMPACT and CRASH models adequately identify patients at high risk for mortality or unfavorable outcome, which supports their use in research settings and for benchmarking in the context of quality-of-care assessment.Copyright Â© 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. publishers.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,10,1377-1388,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7300,635011590,#19768,Dijkland 2021,,yes
Serum Concentration of Myelin Basic Protein as a Prognostic Marker in Mild-to-moderate Head Injury Patients: A Prospective Study in a Tertiary Care Center,Singh A.; Singh K.; Sahu A.; Prasad R.S.; Pandey N.; Dhar S. ,"Objective To estimate the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) and look for its validity in outcome prediction among mild-to-moderate head injury patients. Materials and Methods It was a prospective study done at the Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University from Jan 2018 to July 2019. All patients who presented to us within 48 hours of injury with mild-to-moderate head injury with apparently normal CT brain were include in the study. The serum sample were collected on the day of admission and 48 hours later, and patients were treated with standard protocols and observed 6 months postdischarge. Results Of the 32 patients enrolled, we observed mean MBP level was higher for severity of brain damage, but not associated with age, mode of injury, and radiological diagnosis. Mean MBP levels were not statistically associated with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score at admission but was correlated to outcome with p < 0.05, with sensitivity of 50% and specificity 72%, that is, patients with good outcome have lower mean MBP levels. Conclusion MBP as per our analysis can be used as a prognostic marker in patients with head injury. It is not the absolute value rather a trend showing rise in serum MBP levels, which carries a significant value in outcome prediction.Copyright Â© 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Serum apelin-13 and risk of death following severe traumatic brain injury,Zhuang Y.; Wang W.; Chen L.; Lu W.; Xu M. ,"Background: Apelin-13 can be expressed in brain tissue and exert neuroprotective effects. We attempted to determine whether serum apelin-13 is a prognostic biomarker for severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Method(s): Of 126 sTBI patients and 126 healthy controls, serum apelin-13 concentrations were quantified using ELISA. The trauma severity was assessed by Glasgow coma scale scores and Rotterdam computerized tomography scores. The relationship between serum apelin-13 concentrations and posttraumatic 30-day mortality was assessed using multivariate analysis. Result(s): Serum apelin-13 concentrations were significantly lower in patients than in controls. Serum apelin-13 concentrations of non-surviving and surviving patients within posttraumatic 30 days were strongly correlated with Glasgow coma scale scores and Rotterdam computerized tomography scores. Serum apelin-13 emerged as an independent predictor for 30-day mortality and overall survival. There was a significant discriminatory capability with respect to serum apelin-13 concentrations for the risk of 30-day death. Moreover, its prognostic predictive ability was similar to those of Glasgow coma scale scores and Rotterdam computerized tomography scores. Conclusion(s): Declined serum apelin-13 concentrations, in substantial correlation with increasing severity, are independently associated with short-term mortality, hinting than serum apelin-13 might represent a useful prognostic biomarker for sTBI.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Clinica Chimica Acta,516,"(Zhuang) The Fourth Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province 310053, China(Wang, Chen, Lu, Xu) Department of Neurosurgery, Kunshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunshan Affiliated Hospital of N",64-68,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.01.014,2010858362,#19738,Zhuang 2021,,yes
Prognosis after mild traumatic brain injury: Influence of psychiatric disorders,Marinkovic I.; Isokuortti H.; Huovinen A.; Marinkovic D.T.; Maki K.; Nybo T.; Korvenoja A.; Rahul R.; Vataja R.; Melkas S. ,"Background: We evaluated the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) patients and investigated psychiatric comorbidity in relation to subjective symptoms and return to work (RTW). Method(s): We recruited 103 MTBI patients (mean age 40.8 years, SD 3.1) prospectively from University Hospital. The patients were followed up for one year. The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) were administered one month after MTBI. Three months after MTBI, any psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Result(s): Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 26 patients (25.2%). The most common disorders were previous/current depression. At three months, there was no difference between patients with psychiatric disorders versus those without them in RTW (95.7% vs. 87.3%, p = 0.260) or at least in part-time work (100% vs. 94.4%, p = 0.245). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median time to RTW was 10 days for both groups. The median RPQ score was 13.0 (Interquartile range (IQR) 6.5-19.0) in patients with a psychiatric disorder compared to 8.5 (IQR 2.3-14.0) in those without one (p = 0.021); respectively, the median GOSE was 7.0 (IQR 7.0-8.0) compared to 8.0 (IQR 7.0-8.0, p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Approximately every fourth patient with MTBI had a psychiatric disorder. These patients reported more symptoms, and their functional outcome measured with GOSE at one month after MTBI was worse. However, presence of any psychiatric disorder did not affect RTW. Early contact and adequate follow-up are important when supporting the patient's return to work.Copyright Â© 2020 by the authors.

Role of diffusion tensor imaging combined with neuron-specific enolase and s100 calcium-binding protein b detection in predicting the prognosis of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury,Peng C.; Xing Y.; Tao H.; Yongbing D.; Jingrui H. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) seriously affects the quality of life of patients. The present study evaluated the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) combined with Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) protein in predicting the prognosis of moderate and severe TBI. Method(s): The TBI patients were divided into moderate TBI (TBIm) and severe TBI (TBIs) groups according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after admission. The patients were then divided into good and poor prognosis groups according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS); moreover, their follow-ups were recorded at 3 and 6 months after injury. This study also included 65 healthy individuals with matched age and gender as the control group. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of DTI, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S100B protein levels were detected in this study. The data were analyzed in SPSS software (version 22.0) to evaluate the role of DTI combined with NSE and S100B protein in predicting the prognosis in TBIm and TBIs. Result(s): After TBI, the FA values of DTI in the TBI group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05); moreover, the serum NSE and S100B values in the TBI group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In the TBIm patients, the FA values of the corpus callosum in the good prognosis group were higher than that in the poor prognosis group (P<0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the FA values of the internal capsule and the cerebral peduncle (P>0.05). The serum levels of NSE and S100B in the good prognosis group were significantly lower than those in the poor prognosis group (P<0.05). In the TBIs patients, the FA value of all areas in the good prognosis group was significantly higher than that in the poor prognosis group (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two prognosis groups regarding the serum levels of NSE and S100B (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Although DTI combined with NSE and S100B protein can effectively predict the prognosis of patients with moderate and severe TBI in the early stages, various other measures have been used in the studies to predict the prognosis of TBI patients. Accordingly, comparison with other measures is essential in further studies.Copyright Â© 2021, Author(s).

Serum netrin-1 as a potential biomarker for functional outcome of traumatic brain injury,Xie Y.; Guo Z.; Chen F.; Xiao C.; Xu J.; Bo D. ,"Background: Decreased serum netrin-1 concentrations have been found after acute brain injury. We investigated the role of serum netrin in prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): In this prospective and observational study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect serum netrin-1 concentrations in 50 mild TBI patients (Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, 13-15), 83 moderate TBI patients (GCS score, 9-12), 69 severe TBI patients (GCS score, 3-8) and 50 healthy controls. Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3 at 6 months after trauma was defined as poor outcome. Result(s): Serum netrin-1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderate or severe TBI patients than in controls and in severe TBI patients than in moderate TBI patients, while not in mild TBI patients than in controls. GCS score and Rotterdam computed tomography classification were closely correlated with serum netrin-1 concentrations among TBI patients. Forty-two (20.8%) patients had poor outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that serum netrin-1 concentrations could distinguish patients with poor outcome from the other remainders significantly. In addition, serum netrin-1 concentrations were independently associated with poor outcome. Conclusion(s): Serum netrin-1 might serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis of TBI.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Clinica Chimica Acta,518,"(Xie, Guo, Chen, Xiao) Department of Emergency Medicine, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310006, China(Xu, Bo) Liangzhu Hospital of Yuhang District of Hangzhou City, 1657 Moga",22-27,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.03.008,2011472543,#19718,Xie 2021,,yes
Non-invasive Evaluation of Brain Death Caused by Traumatic Brain Injury by Ultrasound Imaging,Niu N.; Tang Y.; Hao X.; Wang J. ,"Objectives: To investigate the clinical value of non-invasive ultrasound imaging in the evaluation of brain death caused by traumatic brain injury. Method(s): Thirty-four patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were admitted to hospital within 48 h after injury. All patients were monitored intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, echocardiography examination, collection intracranial pressure, MCA-Vs, MCA-Vd, MCA-Vm, EF, LVMPI, RVMPI and other indicators, and combined with clinical conditions and other related data for comparative study and statistical analysis. Result(s): The blood flow spectrum was characterized by diastolic retrograde blood flow spectrum pattern and nail waveform spectrum shape when the patient had clinical brain death. For the parameters of transcranial Doppler, there were significant differences in MCA-Vm and PI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P < 0.05). For the parameters of echocardiography, there were statistically significant differences in EF, LVMPI, and RVMPI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Non-invasive dynamic monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics and cardiac function parameters in patients with severe craniocerebral injury can provide a high accuracy and reliability for the preliminary diagnosis of brain death in patients with severe craniocerebral injury. It is helpful for early evaluation of prognosis and provides effective monitoring methods and guidance for clinical treatment.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Niu, Tang, Hao and Wang.",2020,/,Frontiers in Neuroinformatics,14,"(Niu, Tang, Hao, Wang) Department of Ultrasound, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Tianjin, China",607365,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2020.607365,633524693,#19709,Niu 2020,,yes
Geriatric nutritional risk index as a prognostic factor for mortality in elderly patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries,Su W.-T.; Tsai C.-H.; Huang C.-Y.; Chou S.-E.; Li C.; Hsu S.-Y.; Hsieh C.-H. ,"Background: The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a simple and objective screening tool for clinicians to screen patients' nutritional status based on serum albumin level and their weight and height. The original study had divided patients based on GNRI into quartiles of nutritional risk for death: a no-risk group (GNRI >98), a low-risk group (GNRI 92-98), a moderate-risk group (GNRI 82 to <92), and a major-risk group (GNRI <82). Given that the patients generally sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an acute condition, the study aimed to explore whether GNRI presents a prognostic value for the mortality outcome of these patients. Method(s): From January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, 581 elderly patients with moderate to severe TBI, which was defined as sustaining a head Abbreviated Injury Scale >=3, was included in the study population. The collected data included age, sex, body mass index, serum albumin levels at admission, preexisting comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Injury Severity Score. The primary outcome in the comparison was in-hospital mortality. Result(s): Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that GNRI, ESRD, and ISS were significant independent risk factors for mortality in patients with moderate to severe TBI. When subgrouping the study population into four nutritional risk categories according to the quartile deviation as Q1 (GNRI <85, n = 145), Q2 (GNRI 85 to <93.8 n = 145), Q3 (GNRI 93.8 to 103, n = 145), and Q4 (GNRI >103, n = 146), Q1 patients had a significantly longer LOS in hospital (25.2 days vs 18.6 days, respectively; p = 0.004) and higher mortality rate (28.3% vs 11.7%, respectively; p <0.001) than Q4 patients. The mortality rate was significantly higher in Q1 patients than in Q4 patients (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.14-6.78; p = 0.021). Conclusion(s): This study revealed that the GNRI is a significant independent risk factor and a promising simple assessment tool for mortality in elderly patients with moderate to severe TBI.Copyright Â© 2021 Su et al.",2021,/,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,14,"(Su, Tsai, Huang, Chou, Li, Hsu) Department of Trauma Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan (Republic of China)(Hsieh) Department of Plastic Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial ",2465-2474,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S314487,2007538716,#19661,Su 2021,,yes
The scenario of traumatic brain injury in Brazil-a cross-sectional study of the last decade,Ribeiro J.; Da Silva Amorim D.; Veloso Correia D.; Dib Cunha I.; Alves De Paula Y.; Menezes Silva M.; De Oliveira Silva J.; Cordeiro Rocha A.; Vieira Netto L.; Dornelas Souza R. ,"Background and aims: The traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a disruption or alteration of brain function due to external forces. In trauma, brain injuries are a cause of great concern, due to their poor prognosis and the need for rapid intervention. This study aims to understand the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury in Brazil between 2009 and 2019. Method(s): This is a descriptive study of prevalence. We gathered the data from Brazil's Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) on deaths from TBI from 2009 to 2019. The odds ratio was calculated (p<0,001) using the EpiInfo software. Result(s): In this period, Brazil had 108,748 deaths due to TBI. Throughout the period, there is an average of 9,886 deaths per year, and an annual mortality of 9.54. In relation to the regions, there is higher mortality in the Southeast, 10.47, and lowest in the South, 6.88. Further, we calculated whether the male gender had a higher risk of death, finding an odds ratio of 3,666 (95%CI: 3,611-3,723). The mean time hospitalization was also higher in men (6,5 days) than in women (5,1 days). Conclusion(s): Over the decade, the mortality rate has remained virtually stable. We identified that there is a regional inequality in this country. Moreover, the causes of the difference in mortality from TBI between men and women in Brazil can be the subject of further studies.

Kidney-Brain Link in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients? A preliminary report,Dias C.; Gaio A.R.; Monteiro E.; Barbosa S.; Cerejo A.; Donnelly J.; Felgueiras O.; Smielewski P.; Paiva J.-A.; Czosnyka M. ,"Background: Kidney hyperfiltration with augmented renal clearance is frequently observed in patients with traumatic brain injury. The aim of this study is to report preliminary findings about the relationship between brain autoregulation impairment, estimated kidney glomerular filtration rate and outcome in critically ill patients after severe traumatic brain injury. Method(s): Data collected from a cohort of 18 consecutive patients with severe traumatic brain injury managed with ICP monitoring in a Neurocritical Care Unit, were retrospectively analyzed. Early morning blood tests were performed for routine chemistry assessments and we analyzed creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance, osmolarity, and sodium. Daily norepinephrine dose, protein intake, and water balance were documented. Time average of brain monitoring data (intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebrovascular reactivity pressure index-PRx) were calculated for 6 h before blood sample tests. Patient outcome was evaluated using Glasgow outcome scale at 6-month follow-up, considering nonfatal outcome if GOS >=3 and fatal outcome if GOS <3. Multiple linear regression models were used to study the crude and adjusted effects of the above variables on PRx throughout time. Result(s): A total of 199 complete daily observations from 18 adult consecutive multiple trauma patients with severe traumatic brain injury were analyzed. At hospital admission, the median post-resuscitation Glasgow coma score was 6 (range 3-12), mean SAPSII score was 44.65 with predicted mortality of 36 %. Hospital mortality rate was 27 % and median GOS at 6 month after discharge was 3. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was found to have a negative correlation with PRx (Pearson correlation-0.82), with statistically significant crude (p < 0.001) and adjusted (p = 0.001) effects. For each increase of 10 ml/min in CrCl (estimated either by the Cockcroft-Gault or by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equations) a mean decrease in PRx of approximately 0.01 was expected. Amongst possible confounders only norepinephrine was shown to have a significant effect. Mean PRx value for outcome fatal status was greater than mean PRx for nonfatal status (p < 0.05), regardless of the model used for the CrCl estimation. Conclusion(s): Better cerebral autoregulation evaluated with cerebrovascular PRx is significantly correlated with augmented renal clearance in TBI patients and associates with better outcome.Copyright Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2015,/,Neurocritical Care,22,2,192-201,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-014-0045-1,600130563,#19634,Dias 2015,,yes
"Relationship between YKL-40, neuron-specific enolase, tumor necrosis factor-A, interleukin-6, and clinical assessment scores in traumatic brain injury",Kazakova M.; Pavlov G.; Dichev V.; Simitchiev K.; Stefanov C.; Sarafian V. ,"Background and Objectives: The aim of the present study is to determine plasma and cerebrospinal levels of YKL-40, in combination with neuron-specific enolase (NSE), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and the clinical scales such as Glasgow Coma Scale, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation a III, and MARSHALL classification in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Material(s) and Method(s): This was a prospective study conducted on patient cohort of 27 patients with isolated severe TBI. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were collected on the 24thand 96thh after trauma. CSF samples were obtained also from forensic autopsies of 29 adult healthy cadavers. Result(s): The CSF level of YKL-40 in TBI patients was higher compared to controls, while no significant change between CSF NSE levels in patients and controls was found. We determined a strong correlation between YKL-40 and NSE levels and TBI clinical assessment scores. The analysis of the influence of independent prognostic factors on the outcome of TBI patients showed that plasma NSE concentrations are the major independent variable which is associated with the survival of TBI patients. Still, changes in IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels could not be considered as reliable predictors of mortality. Conclusion(s): We present data for correlation of YKL-40 and NSE levels with clinical scores for assessment of trauma severity and the outcome of TBI patients. Even though further large-scale investigations are required to clarify and evaluate the clinical significance of both biomarkers, our findings suggest that YKL-40 and NSE might be implicated in the pathogenesis of TBI and could indicate the degree of neuroinflammation and brain damage.Copyright Â© 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Systemic inflammatory cytokines improve upon prognostication of neurodegenerative biomarkers for poor outcome following tbi,Lynch C.; Yue J.; Schneider A.; Manley G.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Introduction: We have previously reported on acutely elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) being highly predictive for disability at 6 months in patients from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) UO1 cohort. We now show an increase in levels of the systemic inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa), and hsCRP with increasing peripheral Injury Severity Scale (ISS) score, and demonstrate an enhanced prognostication for outcome in combination with neurodegenerative biomarkers Neurofilament Light (NFL) and Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein (GFAP). Method(s): Prospective prognostic (6 Month Outcome; Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), dichotomized at 8, 7, and 5) analyses of 591 and 477 patients, respectively, from the TRACK-TBIU01 cohort for levels of NFL, GFAP, IL-6, IL-10, and TNFa in plasma collected within 24 hours of injury. Result(s): Levels of IL-6, IL-10 and hsCRP demonstrated dosedependent elevations alongside increasing peripheral ISS score, not seen for NFL, GFAP, or TNFa. NFL and GFAP demonstrated poor prediction for full recovery (GOSE 8 vs <8; AUC of 0.55 and 0.51, respectively) comparable to IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, and hsCRP (AUC <0.55 for all). GFAP, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa and hsCRP demonstrated fair predictive power of for disability (GOSE <5 vs > 5; AUC= 0.78, 0.78, 0.76, 0.63, and 0.69, respectively). NFL showed good predictive power (AUC = 0.84). Adjustment for clinical variables showed good predictive power (AUC = 0.86), with only NFL improving on clinical prediction (p = 0.016).

The use of metabolomics for the prognosis of short-and long-term outcome in adult severe traumatic brain injury (stbi),Winston B.; Banoei M.; Lee C.; Hutchison J.; Wishart D. ,"Introduction: Metabolomics may be utilized for the prediction of outcome as metabolites may function as sensitive and specific biomarkers in the serum of TBI patients. Hypothesis and objectives: Metabolites found on day 1 and day 4 serum post-TBI will allow one to predict outcome at 3 and 12 months after severe TBI. Method(s): In this retrospective study metabolomics investigations were performed on 59 patients with sTBI (GCS 8) including 48 males and 11 females with a mean age 50-20.6. Serum samples drawn at days 1 and 4 post sTBI were used for metabolomics profiling to predict Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE) outcome. sTBI patients were dichotomized to poor (GOSE 1-4) and good outcomes (GOSE 5-8). Targeted quantitative DI-MS/MS and untargeted quantitative 1H-NMR platforms were used. Multivariate data analyses were used to predict the GOSE outcome of patients separated into poor outcome and good outcome. Result(s): Using two analytical platforms, a total of 188 metabolites were identified and quantified in the serum samples of patients. Prognostic models revealed significant differences in serum metabolic biosignatures between sTBI patients with poor outcome and good outcome on day 1 and day 4 post-injury. Metabolic biosignatures were highly predictive and significant for the prognosis of short-term (3-month GOSE) and long-term (12-month GOSE) using multivariate data analysis. Potential Significance: This study demonstrated the use of metabolomics for the prognosis of GOSE outcome in the short and long-term of sTBI patients. The alteration of metabolic profiling on day 4 post-injury were more predictive to prognosticate outcome, probably reflecting a potential role of secondary injuries in determining outcome. Thus adding metabolomics assessment in sTBI to clinical findings will enhance prediction of outcome early in the course of the injury.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,14,A122,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.29111.abstracts,635560324,#19592,Winston 2021,,yes
Serum estradiol associations with patient characteristics and mortality after moderateto-severe tbi: A bioprotect study analysis,Gober I.; Russell A.; Barton D.; Awan N.; Kumar R.; Frankel M.; Wright D.; Wagner A. ,"Endocrine homeostasis is disrupted in moderate-to-severe TBI, specifically affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadotrophic axis and facilitating extra-gonadal sex hormone production. Previous observational longitudinal studies show that serum estradiol (E2) is elevated acutely after moderate-to-severe TBI and is associated with morbidity and mortality. ProTECT III, a multi-site randomized clinical study, assessed progesterone's effects on TBI outcomes and its companion study, BioProTECT, collected serum samples for a subset of enrolled patients. This analysis further investigates the implication of E2 as a biomarker for delineating TBI outcomes among various demographic groups, during the initial 48-hours post-injury. Serum E2 levels (0-, 24-, 48-hours post-injury) were measured via ELISA (n = 574 patients). Higher E2 levels at 48-hours post-injury were associated with increased mortality (p < 0.01; survival = 50.45pg/mL; non-survival = 61.03pg/mL). Survivors had a lower percent change at 48-hours post-injury from baseline [0-hours post-injury (prior to progesterone treatment); 76.62%] compared to non-survivors (159.2%; p < 0.01). Additionally, E2 levels varied by age, with the oldest age quartile of patients (ages 53-93) having higher E2 levels at 24-and 48-hours post-injury compared to the youngest quartile (ages 17-23) (p < 0.01; oldest = 60.80pg/mL; youngest = 45.56pg/mL). At 48-hours post-injury, the oldest patient quartile had a greater percent change in E2 values from baseline compared to the youngest quartile (123.0% vs 43.73%; p < 0.001). Finally, women had higher 48-hour post-injury E2 levels compared to men (females = 58.04pg/mL; males = 47.90pg/mL; p < 0.001), and women had a greater percent change in E2 level at 48-hours compared to baseline than males (females = 106.5% vs males = 35.0% p < 0.001). Overall, we demonstrated that E2 may be a prognostic indicator of mortality after TBI and this may be associated with patient demographic characteristics. Future work will explore potential progesterone treatment and level effects on E2 profiles within this cohort.

Inclusion criteria were age 16-80, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 3-8 and outcome data at 3-6 months. Using a median split (0.649), study participants were divided based on their peak p-tau 181 concentration during the acute ICU period. Patients were evaluated at 6 months post injury and divided into two groups based on Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOS-E): poor outcome (GOS-E score 1-4) and favorable outcome (GOS-E score 5-8). 115 patients (70.12%) were categorized as good and 49 (29.88%) were categorized as poor. Initial p-tau concentration was correlated to 6-month GOS-E score. Chi square test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. Logistic regression was used to create a final model, controlling for both age and injury severity (initial GCS score). Of the 193 participants, mean age was 41-18 years, 79% were male (N= 153, 79.27%) and median initial GCS score was 7. Using a median split, higher serum p-tau concentration predicted poor GOS-E outcome at 6 months (p = 0.009). With age and injury severity controlled for, patients with higher p-tau have 2.17-fold increase of having a poor outcome at 6 months compared to patients with low p-tau levels [OR= 2.17 (95% CI 1.04, 4.51); p = 0.039, AUC= 0.738]. Serum p-tau may represent a prognostic biomarker for clinical evaluation in severe TBI. Larger, more diverse studies on serum p-tau are required to validate our results and define optimized applications in patients who have suffered a severe TBI.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,14,A74,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.29111.abstracts,635560414,#19586,Perkins 2021,,yes
In-hospital mild traumatic brain injury symptom checklists to predict persisting symptoms and identify patient trajectories,Weybright G.; Temkin N.; Nelson L. ,"Symptom burden at 1-2 weeks post-injury is known to predict prolonged symptoms after civilian mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI). Little has been done to investigate the role of in-hospital symptom checklists for predicting chronic symptoms or the early progression of individual symptoms and patients. We investigated acute (< 24 hours post-injury) symptom burden as a predictor of chronic (3+ months post-injury) symptoms and described the trajectories of symptoms from <24 hours to 2 weeks post-injury to inform understanding of symptoms that may influence treatment decisions and outcome predictions. Patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center with mTBI were enrolled in-hospital within 24 hours of injury and completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) at enrollment (acute), 2 weeks (subacute), and 3 and 6 months (chronic) post-injury. We (1) compared prognostic value of acute and subacute symptoms and (2) characterized symptom trajectories from the acute to subacute timepoints. Acute symptom burden was less predictive of chronic symptoms than subacute symptom burden (e.g., acute vs. subacute RPQ total score with 3-month RPQ total was q =.36, p =.045 vs. q =.76, p <.001). However, restricting the acute RPQ total score to the 3 symptoms that best predicted chronic symptoms (frustration, light sensitivity, double vision) increased the predictive value of the acute symptom index (q =.54, p =.001 with 3-month symptoms). Some symptoms improved over 2 weeks (e.g., dizziness, headaches, and nausea), whereas others worsened (e.g., sleep disturbance). Patients were classified with 80% reliable change indices as reporting increasing, decreasing, or stable total symptom burden from <24 hours to 2 weeks, revealing heterogeneity: 25.5% decreased, 34.0% increased, and 40.4% were stable. In summary, acute in-hospital symptom checklists could help prognostic decisions and patient se-lection for early interventions. The findings could also provide an understanding of patients' trajectories of symptoms to personalize treatment to prevent persisting symptoms.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,14,A41-A42,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.29111.abstracts,635560540,#19583,Weybright 2021,,yes
Neurofilament proteins in serum and csf in two cohorts with tbi,Barton D.; Vaughan L.; Xu H.; Yang Z.; Trifilio E.; Williamson J.; Rubenstein R.; Robertson C.; Wagner A.; Wang K. ,"Neurofilament-light (NF-L) and phosphorylated neurofilament-heavy (pNF-H) have been reported as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in TBI. However, these proteins' longitudinal profiles and interrelationships in acute and chronic time periods post-TBI are unclear. We hypothesized CSF and serum levels of NF-L and pNF-H are elevated and correlated with one another, and we posited NF-L and pNF-H levels are associated with disability and neurological outcome after TBI. We analyzed blood and CSF samples from two clinical cohorts (PITT and BC) withmoderate-to-severe TBI.We obtained serum(n = 233) and CSF (n = 93) for day (D) 0-6, and serum every two-weeks for months 1-6 (PITT cohort). Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) were assessed at 6-and 12-months. The BC cohort included individuals from a clinical trial of erythropoietin post-TBI; we collected serum (n = 99) and CSF (n = 54) daily for 10D, and assessed 6-month DRS and GOSE. Serum NF-L and pNF-H gradually rise during the first week and peak 3-4 weeks post-injury. In the PITT cohort, mean NF-L and pNF-H were correlated within CSF (r = 0.44; p < 0.0001), D0-6 serum (r = 0.44; p < 0.0001), and month 1-6 serum (r = 0.38; p < 0.01). NF-L CSF, day 0-6 serum, and month 1-6 serum concentrations were higher among individuals with unfavorable GOSE and correlated with worse DRS (p < 0.05, all comparisons). Higher pNFH serum concentrations (D0-6/month 1-6), but not CSF pNF-H, were associated with unfavorable GOSE and worse DRS (p < 0.05). In the BC cohort, higher D0-10 serum NF-L was associated with unfavorable GOSE (p < 0.01) and worse DRS (p < 0.001), but CSF NF-L and serum/CSF pNF-H were not correlated with outcome. Neurofilament proteins peak 3-4 weeks post-TBI, and NF-L/pNF-H correlate within compartments. Serum NF-L is robustly associated with GOSE and DRS 6-12 months post-TBI.

The leap to multiclass: Understanding the challenge of precise tbi outcome prediction with machine learning,Bhattacharyay S.; Steyerberg E.; Maas A.; Menon D.; Ercole A. ,"By binarizing endpoints, validated traumatic brain injury (TBI) prognosis models have largely excluded the wide variety of TBI outcomes from clinical decision-making. However, multiclass TBI outcome prediction is notoriously difficult, especially for detecting intermediate outcomes. We evaluate multiclass prediction of sixmonth Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) scores from standard TBI predictors to determine whether our focus should be improving modelling strategies (i.e., model flexibility and outcome encoding) or the existing predictor sets. From a prospective cohort of 3,573 TBI patients in the CENTER-TBI study, we extract the widely used IMPACT predictor set which includes age, clinical severity, admission neuroimaging, and lab measurements. Upon multiple imputation of missing values, we train 4 multiclass prediction model types: multinomial logit (ML), ordered logit (OL), neural network with a multinomial output layer (NNM), and neural network with an ordered output layer (NNO). Model performance/calibration is assessed by cross-validation. The results indicate that discrimination of GOSE is not significantly improved by the use of more flexible models. Uniquely, NNM learns to negatively bias predictions of GOSE 8 to increase sensitivity to intermediate outcomes. Accuracy is consistently poor (<47%) as models excessively resort to a binary classification (GOSE 1 vs 8). The mean one-vs-rest AUCs are highest for GOSE 1 (0.90), GOSE 8 (0.78) and GOSE 2/3 (0.77), but even for the most flexible models, intermediate outcomes (GOSE 4-7) are poorly discriminated (AUCs: 0.61-0.67). Since poor GOSE classification performance transcends model complexity and outcome encoding, we conclude that TBI feature sets validated for binary prediction are inadequate for good multiclass prediction. This motivates the search for improved characterization of TBI, relating clinical events to a more fine-grained understanding of outcome.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,14,A82,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.29111.abstracts,635560560,#19580,Bhattacharyay 2021,,yes
Neuroinflammatory biomarkers for traumatic brain injury diagnosis and prognosis: Results from the track-tbi pilot study,Yue J.; Kobeissy F.; Yang Z.; Xu H.; Sun X.; Markowitz A.; Jain S.; Manley G.; Wang K. ,"The relationship between systemic inflammation and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex. Primary injury triggers release of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and alarmins/acute phase reactants. We utilized the prospective multicenter TRACK-TBI Pilot study to investigate candidate markers with utility in clinical/radiographic diagnosis of TBI, and 3-and 6-month outcome. TBI subjects underwent head CT and received blood draw within 24h of injury, and plasma was extracted from analysis. Markers included: cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-16), chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 ((MCP-4), thymus activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)), alarmin/alarmin response proteins (high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), serum amyloid A (SAA), c-reactive protein (CRP)). Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to evaluate marker discriminability for clinical diagnosis (TBI vs. orthopedic control (OC)/healthy control (HC)), TBI severity (GCS 3-12 vs. 13-15), radiographic injury on CT, and unfavorable vs. favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) 1-4 vs. 5-8). One-hundred sixty-eight TBI subjects, 28 OC, and 18 HCs were included. Markers statistically associated with clinical diagnosis were: IL-6, IL-10, IL-16, MCP-4, TARC, HMGB-1, SAA, CRP. Markers for TBI severity: IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-16, TARC, HMGB-1, SAA, CRP. Markers for radiographic TBI: IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-16, HMGB-1, SAA, CRP. Predictors (AUC >0.7) for TBI vs. OC were HMGB-1 (0.84), IL-16 (0.78), TARC (0.73). Predictors for TBI vs. HC: IL-6 (AUC= 0.92), IL-10 (0.87), HMGB-1 (0.87), IL-16 (0.72). Predictors for radiographic TBI: SAA (AUC= 0.77), IL-6 (0.76), CRP (0.73). IL-15 predicted GOSE at 3-and 6-months (AUC= 0.74/0.70, respectively). SAA predicted 6-month GOSE (AUC= 0.70). Our study identified a distinct profile of cytokines, chemokines and alarmin/alarmin response proteins detectable systemically within 24h of acute TBI.

Significance of ICP-related parameters for the treatment and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury,Pan Y.; Xue Y.; Zhao P.; Ding J.; Ren Z.; Xu J. ,"Objective: To analyze the significance of intracranial pressure (ICP)-related parameters on outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The ICP-related parameters included ICP, ICP dose (DICP), regression of the correlation coefficient between amplitude and pressure (RAP), pressure reactivity index (PRx), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed using clinical information from 29 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery from January 2018 to January 2019. All patients underwent ICP probe implantation after admission. Patients were followed up for 6 months after discharge, and were categorized into either the favorable or unfavorable outcome group based on their Glasgow Outcome Scale score. The differences in ICP, DICP, RAP, PRx, and CPP between the two groups were analyzed for their effects on outcome. Result(s): The average ICP, DICP, PRx, and RAP values in patients with favorable outcomes were significantly lower than in patients with unfavorable outcomes, while CPP values were significantly higher in the favorable outcome group. Conclusion(s): Average ICP, DICP, PRx, RAP, and CPP values may indicate disease status and relate to patient outcomes.

The role of optic nerve sheath diameter and rotterdam computerized tomography scoring in predicting the severity of traumatic brain injury,Bedel C.; Koc U. ,"Objective: To determine the predictive value of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) at distances 3 mm and 10 mm behind the posterior limit of the eyeball and of the initial Rotterdam CT Scoring (RCTS) scores in determining the severity and mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design(s): Retrospective study Setting: Department of Emergency Medicine, Health Science University Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Antalya, Turkey Subjects: One hundred and eighty-two patients were included from January to December, 2017 Intervention: None Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic and clinical data and computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain were record-ed. ONSD for each eye was measured on the initial CT scans. Bilateral ONSD was measured at distances 3 and 10 mm behind the posterior limit of the eyeball and RCTS scores were assessed on the same CT images. Result(s): The study included 182 patients [age: 43.68+/-19.65 years; 79.1% males; mean RCTS: 2.53+/-1.35; mortality: 14.3% (n=27)]. The median RCTS score was 4(1-6) mm in non-survi-vors vs. 2(1-6) mm in surviving patients (P<.001). The mortality rate for RCTS score of >=4 was 40% (18/45). The mean ONSD values measured both at 3 mm and 10 mm distances were higher for lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (P=.001, P=.003, respectively). The mean ONSD values were higher for higher RCTS scores (P<.001). The receiver operat-ing curve analysis calculated the best ONSD cut off value to predict mortality as 5.0 mm (sensitivity: 80%; specificity: 78.46%) with an area under curve of 0.856 (95% CI: 79-92.1%).

High Serum Soluble Fas Ligand Levels in Non-survivor Traumatic Brain Injury Patients,Lorente L.; Martin M.M.; Perez-Cejas A.; Gonzalez-Rivero A.F.; Ramos-Gomez L.; Sole-Violan J.; Caceres J.J.; Cabrera J.; Alvarez-Castillo A.; Ferrer-Moure C.; Jimenez A. ,"Purpose: Soluble Fas Ligand (sFasL) is one of the main ligands that activates the apoptosis extrinsic pathway. Higher expression of FasL in brain samples and higher cerebrospinal fluid FasL concentrations in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients than in controls have been found. However, the potential association between blood sFasL concentrations and TBI mortality has not been reported. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether that association exists. Method(s): We included patients with a severe isolated TBI, defined as < 9 points in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and < 10 non-cranial aspects points in Injury Severity Score in this observational and prospective study performed in 5 Intensive Care Units. We measured serum sFasL concentrations on day 1 of TBI. Result(s): We found that 30-day survivor (n = 59) in comparison to non-survivor patients (n = 24) had higher GCS (p = 0.001), lower age (p = 0.004), lower APACHE-II score (p < 0.001), lower intracranial pressure (ICP) (p = 0.01), lower computer tomography (CT) findings of high risk of death (p = 0.02) and lower serum sFasL concentrations (p < 0.001). The area under the curve for mortality prediction by serum sFasL levels was of 75% (95% CI = 63%-87%; p < 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis was found that patients with serum sFasL levels > 29.2 pg/mL had a higher mortality rate (Hazard ratio = 6.2; 95% CI = 2.6-14.8; p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis found an association between serum sFasL levels and mortality after controlling for GCS, age and CT findings (OR = 1.055; 95% CI = 1.018-1.094; p = 0.004), and after controlling for APACHE-II, ICP and CT findings (OR = 1.048; 95% CI = 1.017-1.080; p = 0.002). Conclusion(s): The association between serum sFasL levels and 30-day mortality in TBI patients was the major novel finding of our study; however, future validation could be interesting to confirm those results.Copyright Â© 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.",2021,/,Neurocritical Care,35,1,249-254,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-01158-0,2007789898,#19529,Lorente 2021,,yes
A hierarchical expert-guided machine learning framework for clinical decision support systems: an application to traumatic brain injury prognostication,Farzaneh N.; Williamson C.A.; Gryak J.; Najarian K. ,"Prognosis of the long-term functional outcome of traumatic brain injury is essential for personalized management of that injury. Nonetheless, accurate prediction remains unavailable. Although machine learning has shown promise in many fields, including medical diagnosis and prognosis, such models are rarely deployed in real-world settings due to a lack of transparency and trustworthiness. To address these drawbacks, we propose a machine learning-based framework that is explainable and aligns with clinical domain knowledge. To build such a framework, additional layers of statistical inference and human expert validation are added to the model, which ensures the predicted risk score's trustworthiness. Using 831 patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to build a model using the proposed framework, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.8085 and 0.7488 were achieved, respectively, in determining which patients will experience poor functional outcomes. The performance of the machine learning classifier is not adversely affected by the imposition of statistical and domain knowledge ""checks and balances"". Finally, through a case study, we demonstrate how the decision made by a model might be biased if it is not audited carefully.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",2021,/,npj Digital Medicine,4,1,78,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00445-0,2011448439,#19525,Farzaneh 2021,,yes
Systolic Blood Pressure <110 mm Hg as a Threshold of Hypotension in Patients with Isolated Traumatic Brain Injuries,Gaitanidis A.; Breen K.A.; Maurer L.R.; Saillant N.N.; Kaafarani H.M.A.; Velmahos G.C.; Mendoza A.E. ,"Hypotension is a known risk factor for poor neurologic outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current guidelines suggest that higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds likely confer a mortality benefit. However, there is no consensus on the ideal perfusion pressure among different age groups (i.e., recommended SBP >=100 mm Hg for patients age 50-69 years; >= 110 mm Hg for all other adults). We hypothesize that admission SBP >=110 mm Hg will be associated with improved outcomes regardless of age group. A retrospective database review of the 2010-2016 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database was performed for adults (>= 18 years) with isolated moderate-To-severe TBIs (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] >=3; all other AIS <3). Sub-Analyses were performed after dividing patients by SBP and age; comparison groups were matched with propensity score matching. Primary outcomes were early (6 h, 12 h, and 1 day) and overall in-hospital mortality. Overall, 154,725 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age 62.8 +/- 19.8 years, 89,431 [57.8%] males, Injury Severity Score13.9 +/- 6.8). Multi-variate logistic regression showed that the risk of in-hospital mortality decreased with increasing SBP, plateauing at 110 mm Hg. Among patients of all ages, SBP >=110 mm Hg was associated with improved mortality (SBP 110-129 vs. 90-109 mm Hg: 12 h 0.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.001; 1 day 0.8% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.004; overall 3.2% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001). Among patients age 50-69 years, SBP >=110 mm Hg was associated with improved mortality (SBP 110-119 vs. 100-109 mm Hg: 12 h 0.3% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018; 1 day 0.5% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.007; overall 2.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.015). In conclusion, SBP >=110 mm Hg is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in adult patients with isolated TBIs, including patients age 50-69 years. SBP <110 mm Hg should be used to define hypotension in adult patients of all ages.Â© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",2021,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,38,7,879-885,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7358,634709133,#19508,Gaitanidis 2021,,yes
"Fluid proteomics of CSF and serum reveal important neuroinflammatory proteins in blood-brain barrier disruption and outcome prediction following severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective, observational study",Lindblad C.; Pin E.; Just D.; Al Nimer F.; Nilsson P.; Bellander B.-M.; Svensson M.; Piehl F.; Thelin E.P. ,"Background: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and a subsequent neuroinflammatory process. We aimed to perform a multiplex screening of brain enriched and inflammatory proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in order to study their role in BBB disruption, neuroinflammation and long-term functional outcome in TBI patients and healthy controls. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study on 90 severe TBI patients and 15 control subjects. Clinical outcome data, Glasgow Outcome Score, was collected after 6-12 months. We utilized a suspension bead antibody array analyzed on a FlexMap 3D Luminex platform to characterize 177 unique proteins in matched CSF and serum samples. In addition, we assessed BBB disruption using the CSF-serum albumin quotient (QA), and performed Apolipoprotein E-genotyping as the latter has been linked to BBB function in the absence of trauma. We employed pathway-, cluster-, and proportional odds regression analyses. Key findings were validated in blood samples from an independent TBI cohort. Result(s): TBI patients had an upregulation of structural CNS and neuroinflammatory pathways in both CSF and serum. In total, 114 proteins correlated with QA, among which the top-correlated proteins were complement proteins. A cluster analysis revealed protein levels to be strongly associated with BBB integrity, but not carriage of the Apolipoprotein E4-variant. Among cluster-derived proteins, innate immune pathways were upregulated. Forty unique proteins emanated as novel independent predictors of clinical outcome, that individually explained ~ 10% additional model variance. Among proteins significantly different between TBI patients with intact or disrupted BBB, complement C9 in CSF (p = 0.014, DELTAR2 = 7.4%) and complement factor B in serum (p = 0.003, DELTAR2 = 9.2%) were independent outcome predictors also following step-down modelling. Conclusion(s): This represents the largest concomitant CSF and serum proteomic profiling study so far reported in TBI, providing substantial support to the notion that neuroinflammatory markers, including complement activation, predicts BBB disruption and long-term outcome. Individual proteins identified here could potentially serve to refine current biomarker modelling or represent novel treatment targets in severe TBI.

Development and external validation of a deep neural network analysis of CT scans to predict outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury patients: A track-TBI study,Pease M.W.; Arefan D.; Yuh E.; Barber J.; Tempkin N.; Sharpless J.; Billigen J.; Legaretta A.; Hochberger K.; Wu S.; Okonkwo D. ,"Introduction: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in young adults worldwide. Physicians and other validated models predict long-term outcomes with only moderate success. Multi-institutional models, such as IMPACT, are designed to guide clinical trial design and are not intended to guide clinical decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) models can identify abnormalities in radiographic images with a high degree of accuracy. We applied ML models to CT scans and clinical information from severe TBI for prognostication. Method(s): We developed our model using 537 severe TBI patients from a prospectively collected database at a single institution from 2002-2018 with a CT scan prior to neurosurgical intervention. We applied transfer learning and a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a model using CT scans alone for mortality prediction. The cohort was chronologically split into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation, and independent testing. We also developed an ML-based combined model using clinical variables augmented with CT scans. We externally validated our imaging and combined models with 223 severe TBI patients from 15 institutions in TRACK-TBI. Result(s): The CNN model using CT scans predicted mortality in the independent test cohort with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.92; accuracy of 83%). For the combined model, the AUC increased to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84-0.96; accuracy 88%). The IMPACT model had a lower AUC 0.63 (p<0.001). When tuning our model to a specificity of 1 (i.e. never recommending withdrawing care on a patient who would survive), the sensitivity was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.31-0.66). In the TRACK-TBI external validation, the AUC was 0.81 for the CT image model and 0.75 for the combined model.

Periodic components of the electroencephalography signal correlate with recovery of consciousness after traumatic brain injury,Oganov A.; Gammel T.; Mohammad S.; Janssen M.; Mikell C.; Mofakham S. ,"Introduction: The prognosis for recovery of consciousness secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI) has historically been guided solely by clinical metrics such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) or the Coma Recovery Scale (CRS-R). However, advances in electrophysiological techniques and neuroimaging may now enable identification of preserved brain function in unresponsive patients. We demonstrate that parameterization of electroencephalography (EEG) signal to control for the aperiodic background can reveal otherwise hidden oscillations that predict recovery from coma secondary to TBI. Method(s): Seventeen patients admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital for prolonged loss of consciousness due to TBI were enrolled. Both GCS and continuous EEG were obtained. A one-hour period with minimal sedation was identified and preprocessed in MATLAB using the Fieldtrip toolbox for each patient. This data was parameterized into periodic and aperiodic components using the FOOOF python package. The aperiodic background was subtracted from the signal to give true periodic band power in putative frequency bands (e.g. alpha, beta). These results were k-means clustered into two distinct clusters associated with more favorable (following commands within 60 days of injury) and unfavorable short-term outcomes. Result(s): K-means clustering of the parametrized EEG recordings into periodic signals revealed two areas in the power spectrum space associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Patients with relatively higher theta power combined with lower beta power had poor outcomes. Interestingly, these results were not detectable on the unparameterized EEG signals, which underscores the importance of parameterization to control aperiodic backgrounds.

In total, 1108 patients were included, and the in-hospital mortality was 183 patients (16.3% of the cohort). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed for the ISS, RTS, SI, and MEWS with respect to the prediction of in-hospital mortality. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the ISS, RTS, SI, and MEWS were 0.638 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.603-0.672), 0.742 (95% CI, 0.709-0.772), 0.524 (95% CI, 0.489-0.560), and 0.799 (95% CI, 0.769-0.827), respectively. The AUC of MEWS was significantly different from the AUCs of ISS, RTS, and SI. In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio (OR), 1.012; 95% CI, 1.000-1.023), the ISS (OR, 1.040; 95% CI, 1.013-1.069), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (OR, 0.793; 95% CI, 0.761-0.826), and body temperature (BT) (OR, 0.465; 95% CI, 0.329-0.655) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for confounders. In the present study, the MEWS showed fair performance for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI. The GCS score and BT seemed to have a significant role in the discrimination ability of the MEWS. The MEWS may be a useful tool for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

Ultrasonic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter in elderly patients with craniocerebral injury,Qiao Z.; Wang L.; Li S.; Li Y.; Gao N.; Jia L.; Liu C.; Zhai L.; Li F. ,"Objective: To explore the application value of ultrasonic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter in elderly patients with craniocerebral injury. Method(s): 86 cases of elderly patients with craniocerebral injury treated in our hospital between January 2017 and December 2018 were included, all of whom had the invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in ultrasonic testing. According to ICP measurement results, patients were divided into a normal ICP group (n = 44) and an increased ICP group (ICP >= 20 mmHg stood for increased ICP, n = 42). Gender, age, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, hospital stay, oxyhemoglobin saturation, ISS score, ONSD value, hematoma type, primary injury, associated injury and complications of the patients were compared. Result(s): The univariate analysis showed that the systolic blood pressure in the ICP increased group was significantly decreased while the blood glucose, ISS and ONSD values showed significant increase (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that associated injury, systolic blood pressure and ONSD value had a significant influence on the increase of intracranial pressure (all P < 0.05). ONSD is positively correlated with ICP (r = 0.855, P = 0.000). The areas of systolic blood pressure and ONSD value under the curve in diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure in elderly patients with craniocerebral injury were 0.717 and 0.780, respectively. When the ONSD value was 4.90 mm, the area under the curve was 0.780, the sensitivity and specificity were 89.00% and 91.00%, respectively. When the ONSD value predicted that the critical value of good/poor prognosis of patients was 4.70 mm, the area under the curve was 0.796, the sensitivity was 91.00%, and the specificity was 90.00%. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter can diagnose the increase of intracranial pressure in elderly patients with craniocerebral injury, and can better predict the prognosis.Copyright Â© 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The Association Between D-dimer Levels and Long-Term Neurological Outcomes of Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury: An Analysis of a Nationwide Observational Neurotrauma Database in Japan,Fujiwara G.; Okada Y.; Sakakibara T.; Yamaki T.; Hashimoto N. ,"Background: We evaluated the association between D-dimer (DD) levels and long-term neurological prognoses among patients with isolated traumatic brain injury. Method(s): Using data from multiple centers in the Japanese Neurotrauma Data Bank, we conducted an observational retrospective cohort study. Patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (head Abbreviated Injury Scale score > 2; any other Abbreviated Injury Scale score < 3) who were registered in the Japanese Neurotrauma Data Bank from 2015 to 2017 were recruited. We excluded patients younger than age 16 years and those who developed cardiac arrest at hospital admission. We also excluded patients with unknown Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 6 months after injury and those with unknown DD levels. The primary outcome was the association of DD levels with GOS scores at 6 months. We defined GOS scores 1 to 3 as poor and GOS scores 4 and 5 as good. The secondary outcome was the association of DD levels with mortality at 6 months after injury. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to calculate the adjusted odds ratios of DD levels at hospital admission and GOS scores at 6 months as tertiles with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 293 patients were enrolled (median age 67 years; interquartile range 51-79 years). The median DD level was 27.1 mg/L (interquartile range 9.7-70.8 mg/L), and 58.0% (n = 170) had poor GOS scores at 6 months. Result(s): The multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratios were 2.52 (95% CI 1.10-5.77) for middle DD levels with poor GOS scores at 6 months and 5.81 (95% CI 2.37-14.2) for high DD levels with poor GOS scores at 6 months. Conclusion(s): We revealed an association between DD levels and poor long-term neurological outcomes among patients with isolated traumatic brain injury.Copyright Â© 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.",2021,/,Neurocritical Care,,"(Fujiwara, Hashimoto) Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan(Okada) Department of Preventive Services, School of Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan(Sakakibara, Yama",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-021-01329-7,2013570315,#19383,Fujiwara 2021,,yes
Severe brain injury in the elderly: Incidence and prognostic factors,Slama A.Y.B.; Hamada H.B.; Chouchane C.; Ajmi M.; Herch R.; Kahloul M.; Naija W. ,"Introduction: Brain injury is a common cause of morbi-mortality in the elderly because of the interaction of various factors related to aging. Aim(s): to evaluate the incidence, epidemiological characteristics and prognostic factors of severe cranial trauma in the elderly. Method(s): This is a retrospective, observational, epidemiological, and analytic study, conducted in a Tunisian department of anesthesia and intensive care. All patients hospitalized between 2005 and 2018, for an isolated severe brain injury were included. Collected data included socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and radiological features, management related data and the outcome. Result(s): Our Study included 41 patients with a mean age of 71.49 +/- 7.67 years, a sexe-ratio of 4 and an ASA I status in 50% of cases. Most frequent mechanisms were road accidents (21 cases) and falls (17 cases). The most frequent lesions were subarachnoid hemorrhage (75.6%), cerebral contusions (53.7%) and subdural hematoma (51.2%). Follow-up scans showed an improvement of the injury in 20% of cases, a stabilization in 20% of cases and an aggravation in 60% of cases. Only two patients were immediately operated for subdural hematoma. The mortality rate was 63.4%. For the survivals, ten patients were transferred to the department of rehabilitation and five patients were discharged. Three patients had motors deficits and two patients had cognitive disorders. Main prognostic factors were the time taken to arrange medical treatment by the emergency medical team, the time taken to reach the hospital for all kinds of transports, the ASA status, the quality of transport, the initially presence of cerebral edema, severe hypercapnia, hypotension and the number of secondary systemic insults to the brain. Conclusion(s): Prognostic factors of severe brain injury in the elderly should be considered in establishing preventive targeted measures and in identifying high risk patients who require an optimal management.",2021,/,Anesthesia and Analgesia,133,3 SUPPL 2,1880,,,636064931,#19373,Slama 2021,,yes
Comorbidity-Related Functional Implications In Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review,Hanafy S.; Xiong C.; Chan V.; Sutton M.; Escobar M.; Colantonio A.; Mollayeva T. ,"Objective(s): To systematically identify and synthesize existing evidence on comorbidity-related implications in adults with TBI. Data Sources: Systematic searches were conducted in Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and PsycINFO, from May 1997 to September 2020. Study Selection: Peer-reviewed English journal articles on prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies focusing on comorbidity in relation to cognitive or physical functioning in adult patients with TBI, were considered eligible. Letters to editors, reviews without data, case reports, conference abstracts, articles without primary data, studies that focus on therapeutic interventions, and theses, were excluded. Three researchers independently screened and assessed articles for fulfillment of the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Quality assessment followed the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology recommendations. Data Synthesis: A total of 15,278 citations were abstracted from databases searched. Twenty-two studies of moderate quality discussed effects of comorbidities on functional outcomes in patients with TBI. The extracted data were synthesized through tabulation and qualitative description. Cognitive and physical functioning were negatively affected by a wide range of studied comorbidities, including systemic medical diseases, psychiatric conditions, and neurological disorders. The effect of comorbidity, even within the same categories of comorbidity and functional outcome, differed across studies. Severity of TBI, sex/gender, and age were important factors in the relationship. Due to methodological heterogeneity between studies, meta-analyses were not performed. Conclusion(s): This systematic review highlights the adverse effect of comorbidities on functional outcome in patients with TBI and enhances our understanding of their impact for both patients with TBI and clinicians who treat and rehabilitate these patients. It is essential to be aware of these comorbidity-related functional implications. PROSPERO registration (CRD 42017070033).

Serum Caspase-1 as an Independent Prognostic Factor in Traumatic Brain Injured Patients,Perez-Barcena J.; Rodriguez Pilar J.; Salazar O.; Crespi C.; Frontera G.; Novo M.A.; Guardiola M.B.; Llompart-Pou J.A.; Ibanez J.; de Rivero Vaccari J.P. ,"Background: The objectives of this study were to assess the association between serum caspase 1 levels and known clinical and radiological prognostic factors and determine whether caspase 1was a more powerful predictor of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) than clinical indices alone, to determine the association between the serum levels of caspase 1 and the 6-month outcome, and to evaluate if there is any association between caspase 1 with clinical and radiological variables. Method(s): This prospective and observational study was conducted in a university hospital and included patients with TBI who required hospital admission. Serum samples were collected at hospital admission and 24 h after TBI. Caspase 1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to test the potential of caspase 1 to predict mortality (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score of 1) and unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended scores of 1-4). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of serum caspase 1 levels, adjusted by known clinical and radiological prognostic indices, on the outcome. Result(s): One hundred thirty-two patients and 33 healthy controls were included. We obtained 6-month outcome in 118 patients. On admission, the mean serum levels of caspase 1 were higher in patients with TBI compared with controls (157.9 vs. 108.5 pg/mL; p < 0.05) but not at 24 h after TBI. Serum caspase 1 levels on admission were higher in patients with unfavorable outcomes (189.5 vs. 144.1 pg/mL; p = 0.009). Similarly, serum caspase 1 levels on admission were higher in patients who died vs. patients who survived (213.6 vs. 146.8 pg/mL; p = 0.03). A logistic regression model showed that the serum caspase 1 level on admission was an independent predictor of 6-month unfavorable outcomes (odds ratio 1.05; 95% confidence interval 1-1.11; p = 0.05). Caspase 1 levels were higher in patients with severe TBI compared with those with moderate TBI, those with mild TBI, and healthy controls (p < 0.001). We did not find any correlation between caspase 1 and the radiological variables studied. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of patients with TBI, we show that serum caspase 1 protein levels on admission are an independent prognostic factor after TBI. Serum caspase 1 levels on admission are higher in patients who will present unfavorable outcomes 6 months after TBI.

Prognostic value of circadian rhythm of brain temperature in traumatic brain injury,Kuo L.-T.; Lu H.-Y.; Huang A.P.-H. ,"Hypothermia has been used in postoperative management of traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the rhythmic variation and prognostic value of brain temperature after TBI have never been studied. This study describes diurnal brain temperature patterns in comatose patients with TBI. Mesors of brain temperature, amplitude, and acrophase were estimated from recorded temperature measurements using cosinor analysis. The association of these patterns with clinical parameters, mortality, and functional outcomes in a 12-month follow-up was examined. According to the cosinor analysis, 59.3% of patients presented with circadian rhythms of brain temperature in the first 72 h postoperatively. The rhythm-adjusted mesor of brain temperature was 37.39 +/- 1.21 C, with a diminished mean amplitude of 0.28 (+/-0.25) C; a shift of temperature acrophase was also observed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that initial Glasgow coma scale score, age, elevated blood glucose level, and circadian rhythm of brain temperature seemed to be predictive and prognostic factors of patients' functional outcomes. For the prediction of survival status, younger patients or those patients with mesor within the middle 50% of brain temperature were more likely to survive. The analysis of brain temperature rhythms in patients with moderate and severe TBI provided additional predictive information related to mortality and functional outcomes.Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

The prognostic value of cardiac troponin T in different age groups of traumatic brain injury patients,Wang R.; He M.; Xu J. ,"Background: The cardiac dysfunction has been confirmed as a common non-neurological complication and associated with increased mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. As a biological marker of cardiac injury, the cardiac troponin T (TnT) has been verified correlated with the outcome of some non-traumatic brain injury patients. However, the prognostic value of TnT in TBI patients has not been clearly illustrated. We designed this study to explore the association between TnT and the outcome of TBI patients in different age subgroups. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with TBI in a prospective critical care database were eligible for this study. Univariate logistic regression analysis was firstly performed to explore the relationship between included variables and mortality. Then, the real effect of TnT on the outcome of different age subgroups was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting the confounding effects of other significant risk factors. Finally, we draw receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the prognostic value of TnT in different age groups of TBI patients. Result(s): 520 patients were included in this study with a mortality rate of 20.2%. There were 112 (21.5%) non-elderly patients (age < 65) and 408 (78.5%) elderly patients (age >= 65). Non-survivors had a higher percentage of previous acute myocardial infarction (p = 0.019) and pupil no-reaction (p = 0.028; p = 0.011) than survivors. Survivors had higher GCS (p < 0.001) and lower TnT than non-survivors (p < 0.001). TnT was significantly associated with mortality in non-elderly patients (p = 0.031) but not in overall patients (p = 0.143) and elderly patients (p = 0.456) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The AUC (area under the ROC curve) value of TnT in overall, non-elderly and elderly patients was 0.644, 0.693 and 0.632, respectively. Combining TnT with GCS increased the sensitivity of predicting the poor outcome in both non-elderly and elderly TBI patients. Conclusion(s): The prognostic value of TnT differed between elderly and non-elderly TBI patients. Level of TnT was associated with mortality of non-elderly TBI patients but not elderly patients. Combining the TnT with GCS could increase the sensitivity of prognosis evaluation.Copyright Â© 2021, Belgian Neurological Society.",2021,/,Acta Neurologica Belgica,,"(Wang, Xu) Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan province 610041, China(He) Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu,",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13760-021-01796-x,2013695575,#19345,Wang 2021,,yes
Epigenetic regulation of ABCC8 and TRPM4 is associated with intracranial hypertension and outcome after severe TBI,Jha R. ,"Introduction: SUR1-TRPM4 is a key channel that mediates secondary injury pathophysiology after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Genetic variation within ABCC8 (SUR1) and TRPM4 is associated with TBI intracranial hypertension, hemorrhage progression and outcome, with several significant polymorphisms influencing brain-specific expression of these genes. Epigenetic regulation of SUR1-TRPM4 remains unexplored and may alter gene expression in key pathways after TBI. We assessed associations between ABCC8 and TRPM4 DNA methylation, intracranial hypertension, and outcome in severe TBI. Method(s): 120 severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score <=8) patients aged 16-80 were enrolled. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected on days 1, 3, and 5 (368 samples) via external ventricular drain. DNA was extracted from CSF white blood cells and methylation was assessed (Illumina HumanMethylation450k bead chips), including DNA methylation at 29 sites in ABCC8 and TRPM4. 17 (4.6%) samples were removed after quality control. Multivariable linear regression models tested for associations between methylation and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score and proportion of hourly intracranial pressure (ICP) readings >=25 mmHg for each patient (alpha=0.0009, Bonferroni). Models were adjusted for age, sex, GCS, and surrogate variables accounting for cell-type heterogeneity and batch effects (logFC calculated with M-values). Result(s): Increased methylation on day 1 at two sites within the TRPM4 gene was associated with higher GOS score (improved outcome) at 3-months: cg16749456 (logFC=0.444, p=0.0001) and cg14325661 (logFC=0.250, p=0.0008). Increased methylation of one site within the 5'UTR of the ABCC8 on day 1 was associated with lower GOS score (worse outcome) at 3-months (cg13851843: logFC= -0.254, p=0.0006). Increased methylation on day 3 at an additional CpG site within TRPM4 was associated with a lower proportion of ICP measurements >=25 mmHg (cg21520111: logFC= -1.214, p=0.0007). Conclusion(s): In this exploratory study, DNA methylation of two sites in TRPM4 was associated with improved functional outcome, and methylation of a third site was associated with less intracranial hypertension. In our prior reports, protective variant TRPM4 polymorphisms decreased TRPM4 mRNA expression which is directionally consistent with these methylation data. In contrast, DNA methylation of a site in ABCC8 was associated with worse outcome. Epigenetic regulation may modulate expression of the SUR1-TRPM4 channel in the brain after severe TBI. Further studies validating these findings and investigating their molecular consequences are needed and might ultimately inform risk-stratification, prognostication, and precision management after severe TBI.",2021,/,Annals of Neurology,90,SUPPL 27,S250,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ana.26180,636273767,#19301,Jha 2021,,yes
Sodium homeostasis in patients with traumatic brain injury and its impact on mortality,Gaibino N.; Medeiros I.C.; Mota P.; Fernandes S.M.; Moniz I.; Ribeiro J. ,"Introduction. Dysregulation of sodium homeostasis is associated with a higher risk of mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recently it has been reported that sodium shifts, even within its normal range, can have an impact on mortality, even though its prognostic value is still misunderstood. We hypothesize that sodium shifts during the first few days after moderate or severe TBI might be associated with mortality in this population. Methods. Observational and retrospective study that included all patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to a Neurocritical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a large urban, referral university hospital, between January 2017 and April 2019. We collected values of sodium obtained at morning evaluation in all patients at 24, 48 and 72 h after ICU admission. Demographic data and survival was also documented. Results. Eighty-six patients were identified with moderate (20%) to severe (80%) TBI, 40% of which had also other trauma lesions. They were predominantly of male gender, with a mean age of 50 +/- 17 years and 57% with at least one relevant comorbidity. At ICU admission they had a mean GCS of 8.2 +/- 3.1 and a SAPS II score of 46.1. +/- 20.0. 98% of patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation. Among the studied population 54% had intracranial pressure monitoring, 39% were submitted to decompressive craniectomy and in 27% an external ventricular drain was placed. Pharmacological treatment was initiated in 9% of patients with thiopental and in 13% with mannitol. Global ICU mortality at day 30 after TBI was 27%. Sodium levels at admission were between 126-154 mmol/L, with a mean of 139 mmol/L. When we searched for sodium shifts, we found a higher sodium shift up to 72 h after admission (8.2 mmol/L) in patients who died when compared to sodium shift up to 72 h after admission (3.1 mmol/L) in patients who survived (p = 0.02). This difference was also seen for sodium shifts at 24 (p = 0.002) and 48 h (p = 0.004) after admission. In a multivariate logistic regression, sodium shifts at 72 h were still associated with a mortality increase at 30 days after adjusting for SAPS II, administration of thiopental or mannitol to control elevated intracranial pressure, intracranial pressure monitoring or need for decompressive craniectomy. Conclusion. In patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to a neurocritical ICU, minimal sodium shift seems to be an independent mortality predictor. We believe that monitoring sodium shifts may affect decisions concerning the treatment of severe TBI patients, namely in face of elevated intracranial pressure.",2021,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,9,SUPPL 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-021-00415-6,636288521,#19285,Gaibino 2021,,yes
Machine learning to understand unmet needs for multiclass outcome prediction in the ICU after traumatic brain injury,Bhattacharyay S.; Steyerberg E.; Maas A.; Menon D.; Ercole A. ,"Introduction. Well validated models exist only for dichotomous outcome prognosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dichotomisation, however, fails to capture the broad continuum of outcomes which may be crucial for shared decision-making and treatment stratification in the ICU. On the other hand, multiclass TBI outcome prediction performance is poor, especially for intermediate outcomes, but it is unclear whether this is due to inflexible modelling strategies (i.e., model complexity and outcome encoding) or inadequate disease characterisation by existing predictors. Objectives. We assess multiclass prediction of the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) [1] at 6 months from standard TBI predictors as a function of endpoint encoding (multinomial vs ordinal) and model complexity (logistic regression vs deep learning). Methods. We use data from a prospective cohort of 3,573 patients from the CENTER-TBI [2] study, extracted using Opal [3]. We use the IMPACT [4] extended predictor set (10 covariates collected within 24 h of ED/ICU admission) including age, clinical severity scores, secondary insult indicators, CT characteristics, and lab values. Missing values are multiply imputed (m = 100), and we train 4 multiclass prediction model types: multinomial logistic regression (MLR), ordinal logistic regression (OLR), neural network with a multinomial output layer (DeepM), and neural network with an ordinal output layer (DeepO). Model performance and calibration is assessed with repeated crossvalidation (20 repeats, 5 folds). We also calculate predictor significance (Shapley values) [5]. Results. As shown in Fig 1, discrimination of GOSE does not vary significantly with model type based on 95% CIs. Even the most flexible models yield AUCs with only modest discrimination (AUC between 0.61 and 0.66) for intermediate outcomes. MLR, OLR, and DeepO predictions are well-calibrated to true GOSE distributions, but DeepM learns to negatively bias predictions of GOSE 8 to increase sensitivity to intermediate outcomes. Classification performance is consistently poor (mean accuracy <= 46%) due to excessive categorisation into GOSE 1 or GOSE 8 effectively reducing a multiclass problem to a dichotomous one. Based on paired Wilcoxon tests for predictor significance (alpha = 0.05) age, motor Glasgow Coma Score, Marshall CT classification, and pupil reactivity are the most significant while the lab values (glucose and Hb) and presence of an epidural haematoma are the least. Conclusion. Since the poor performance of GOSE prediction models is independent of complexity and outcome encoding, it follows that features known to predict dichotomous outcomes are insufficient for multiclass prediction. This result suggests that either admission characterisation is incomplete for intermediate outcomes or these outcomes are better explained by events during ICU stay. This motivates the search for a better classification of TBI that is related to a more nuanced understanding of outcome.",2021,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,9,SUPPL 1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-021-00415-6,636291268,#19280,Bhattacharyay 2021,,yes
Axonal marker neurofilament light predicts long-term outcomes and progressive neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury,Graham N.S.N.; Zimmerman K.A.; Moro F.; Heslegrave A.; Maillard S.A.; Bernini A.; Miroz J.-P.; Donat C.K.; Lopez M.Y.; Bourke N.; Jolly A.E.; Mallas E.-J.; Soreq E.; Wilson M.H.; Fatania G.; Roi D.; Patel M.C.; Garbero E.; Nattino G.; Baciu C.; Fainardi E.; Chieregato A.; Gradisek P.; Magnoni S.; Oddo M.; Zetterberg H.; Bertolini G.; Sharp D.J. ,"Axonal injury is a key determinant of long-term outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) but has been difficult to measure clinically. Fluid biomarker assays can now sensitively quantify neuronal proteins in blood. Axonal components such as neurofilament light (NfL) potentially provide a diagnostic measure of injury. In the multicenter BIO-AX-TBI study of moderate-severe TBI, we investigated relationships between fluid biomarkers, advanced neuroimaging, and clinical outcomes. Cerebral microdialysis was used to assess biomarker concentrations in brain extracellular fluid aligned with plasma measurement. An experimental injury model was used to validate biomarkers against histopathology. Plasma NfL increased after TBI, peaking at 10 days to 6 weeks but remaining abnormal at 1 year. Concentrations were around 10 times higher early after TBI than in controls (patients with extracranial injuries). NfL concentrations correlated with diffusion MRI measures of axonal injury and predicted white matter neurodegeneration. Plasma TAU predicted early gray matter atrophy. NfL was the strongest predictor of functional outcomes at 1 year. Cerebral microdialysis showed that NfL concentrations in plasma and brain extracellular fluid were highly correlated. An experimental injury model confirmed a dose-response relationship of histopathologically defined axonal injury to plasma NfL. In conclusion, plasma NfL provides a sensitive and clinically meaningful measure of axonal injury produced by TBI.

Smaller Regional Brain Volumes Predict Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at 3 Months After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,Stein M.B.; Yuh E.; Jain S.; Okonkwo D.O.; Mac Donald C.L.; Levin H.; Giacino J.T.; Dikmen S.; Vassar M.J.; Diaz-Arrastia R.; Robertson C.S.; Nelson L.D.; McCrea M.; Sun X.; Temkin N.; Taylor S.R.; Markowitz A.J.; Manley G.T.; Mukherjee P.; Adeoye O.; Badjatia N.; Boase K.; Barber J.; Bodien Y.; Bullock M.R.; Chesnut R.; Corrigan J.D.; Crawford K.; Duhaime A.-C.; Ellenbogen R.; Feeser V.R.; Ferguson A.R.; Foreman B.; Gardner R.; Gaudette E.; Goldman D.; Gonzalez L.; Gopinath S.; Gullapalli R.; Hemphill J.C.; Hotz G.; Keene C.D.; Korley F.K.; Kramer J.; Kreitzer N.; Lindsell C.; Machamer J.; Madden C.; Martin A.; McAllister T.; Merchant R.; Ngwenya L.B.; Noel F.; Nolan A.; Palacios E.; Perl D.; Puccio A.; Rabinowitz M.; Robertson C.; Rosand J.; Sander A.; Satris G.; Schnyer D.; Seabury S.; Toga A.; Valadka A.; Vespa P.; Wang K.; Yue J.K.; Zafonte R. ,"Background: Brain volumes in regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala have been associated with risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of this study was to determine whether a set of regional brain volumes, measured by magnetic resonance imaging at 2 weeks following mild traumatic brain injury, were predictive of PTSD at 3 and 6 months after injury. Method(s): Using data from TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI), we included patients (N = 421) with Glasgow Coma Scale scores 13-15 assessed after evaluation in the emergency department and at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after injury. Probable PTSD diagnosis (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score, >=33) was the outcome. FreeSurfer 6.0 was used to perform volumetric analysis of three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance images at 3T obtained 2 weeks post injury. Brain regions selected a priori for volumetric analyses were insula, hippocampus, amygdala, superior frontal cortex, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, and lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices. Result(s): Overall, 77 (18.3%) and 70 (16.6%) patients had probable PTSD at 3 and 6 months. A composite volume derived as the first principal component incorporating 73.8% of the variance in insula, superior frontal cortex, and rostral and caudal cingulate contributed to the prediction of 3-month (but not 6-month) PTSD in multivariable models incorporating other established risk factors. Conclusion(s): Results, while needing replication, provide support for a brain reserve hypothesis of PTSD and proof of principle for how prediction of at-risk individuals might be accomplished to enhance prognostic accuracy and enrich clinical prevention trials for individuals at the highest risk of PTSD following mild traumatic brain injury.Copyright Â© 2020",2021,/,Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,6,3,352-359,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.10.008,2010850012,#19219,Stein 2021,,yes
Development of a Prognostic Model to Predict Mortality after Traumatic Brain Injury in Intensive Care Setting in a Developing Country,Jayan M.; Shukla D.; Devi B.I.; Bhat D.I.; Konar S.K. ,"Objectives We aimed to develop a prognostic model for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit (ICU) of our institute. Materials and Methods The clinical and computed tomography scan data of consecutive patients admitted after a diagnosis TBI in ICU were reviewed. Construction of the model was done by using all the variables of Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury and International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI models. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 243 patients with TBI were admitted to ICU during the study period. The in-hospital mortality was 15.3%. On multivariate analysis, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at admission, hypoxia, hypotension, and obliteration of the third ventricle/basal cisterns were significantly associated with mortality. Patients with hypoxia had eight times, with hypotensions 22 times, and with obliteration of the third ventricle/basal cisterns three times more chance of death. The TBI score was developed as a sum of individual points assigned as follows: GCS score 3 to 4 (+2 points), 5 to 12 (+1), hypoxia (+1), hypotension (+1), and obliteration third ventricle/basal cistern (+1). The mortality was 0% for a score of 0 and 85% for a score of 4. Conclusion The outcome of patients treated in ICU was based on common admission variables. A simple clinical grading score allows risk stratification of patients with TBI admitted in ICU.Copyright Â© 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

A prognostic model incorporating red cell distribution width to platelet ratio for patients with traumatic brain injury,Wang R.; He M.; Zhang J.; Wang S.; Xu J. ,"Background: As an inflammation-based marker, red cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) has been verified to be associated with disease severity and outcome in many clinical settings. We designed this study to evaluate the prognostic value of RPR in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): A total of 420 patients admitted with TBI were included in this study. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from an electronic medical record system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were sequentially performed to discover risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to confirm the predictive value of different markers including RPR in training set and testing set. Result(s): Non-survivors had higher level of RPR than survivors (P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that RPR was significantly associated with mortality even after adjust-ing for confounding factors (P<0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for predicting mortality was 0.761 and 0775 in training set and testing set, respectively. And the constructed predictive model incorporating RPR had the highest AUC value of 0.858 and 0.884 in training set and testing set. Conclusion(s): RPR is significantly associated with mortality in TBI patients. Utilizing RPR to construct a predictive model is valuable to evaluate prognosis of TBI patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Wang et al.",2021,/,Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management,17,"(Wang, Zhang, Xu) Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China(He) Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China(Wang) Department of",1239-1248,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S337040,2014684859,#19187,Wang 2021,,yes
Diffusion Tensor Imaging Correlates of Concussion Related Cognitive Impairment,Gonzalez A.C.; Kim M.; Keser Z.; Ibrahim L.; Singh S.K.; Ahmad M.J.; Hasan O.; Kamali A.; Hasan K.M.; Schulz P.E. ,"Introduction: Cognitive impairment after concussion has been widely reported, but there is no reliable imaging biomarker that predicts the severity of cognitive decline post-concussion. This study tests the hypothesis that patients with a history of concussion and persistent cognitive impairment have fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that are specifically associated with poor performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Method(s): Fifty-three subjects (19 females) with concussions and persistent cognitive symptoms had MR imaging and the MoCA. Imaging was analyzed by atlas-based, whole-brain DTI segmentation and FLAIR lesion segmentation. Then, we conducted a random forest-based recursive feature elimination (RFE) with 10-fold cross-validation on the entire dataset, and with partial correlation adjustment for age and lesion load. Result(s): RFE showed that 11 DTI variables were found to be important predictors of MoCA scores. Partial correlation analyses, corrected for age and lesion load, showed significant correlations between MoCA scores and right fronto-temporal regions: inferior temporal gyrus MD (r = -0.62, p = 0.00001), middle temporal gyrus MD (r = -0.54, p = 0.0001), angular gyrus MD (r = -0.48, p = 0.0008), and inferior frontal gyrus FA (r = 0.44, p = 0.002). Discussion(s): This is the first study to demonstrate a correlation between MoCA scores and DTI variables in patients with a history of concussion and persistent cognitive impairment. This kind of research will significantly increase our understanding of why certain persons have persistent cognitive changes after concussion which, in turn, may allow us to predict persistent impairment after concussion and suggest new interventions.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Gonzalez, Kim, Keser, Ibrahim, Singh, Ahmad, Hasan, Kamali, Hasan and Schulz.",2021,/,Frontiers in Neurology,12,"(Gonzalez, Kim, Keser, Ibrahim, Singh, Ahmad, Hasan, Schulz) Department of Neurology, University of Texas McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX, United States(Kamali, Hasan) Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University of Texas McGover",639179,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.639179,635197861,#19186,Gonzalez 2021,,yes
Role of apolipoprotein E gene variants in cognitive outcome of patients after moderate degree diffuse brain injuries,Jaleel M.A.; Zubeda S.; Grandhi A.; Hasan Q. ,"Introduction: Diffuse Brain Injury (DBI) has been shown to be the major form of the primary brain traumatic injury. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is considered to be associated in the prognosis of DBI. Aim(s): To analyse change in cognitive outcome of moderate degree DBI patients and its association with APOE gene polymorphism. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Kamineni Hospitals, LB Nagar, Hyderabad, Telangana, India, from March 2018 to May 2019, in which 23 patients who had moderate DBI were included. Patients were genotyped for APOE polymorphism and intellectual function was assessed when the patient was being discharged using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and was repeated after three months. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to determine the change in MMSE score taken at the time of discharge and after three months in follow-up. Result(s): Of the total 23 patients, 19, 82.60% were males and 4, 17.40% were females. E2/E3 APOE genotype was present in 16, 69.56% subjects. The improvement of MMSE score at the end of three months following discharge showed that best recovery was in subjects with E2/E3 genotype with mean of 4.9+/-2.1, followed by E2/E2 i.e., 3.5+/-2.6. In order to evaluate the changes in MMSE score at the time of discharge and after three months due to the presence of APOE genotype E2/E3 a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed which revealed statistically significant positive change in MMSE score after three months, z=-3.512, p=0.00044, with a large effect size (r=0.620). Conclusion(s): This preliminary study indicated that APOE E2/ E3 individuals showed a better recovery after traumatic brain injuries based on MMSE scores. However, extended studies are needed to establish this which may also give more weightage for genotyping APOE as a prognostic marker.Copyright Â© 2021 University of Benin.

Variability in Serum Sodium Concentration and Prognostic Significance in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Multicenter Observational Study,Harrois A.; Anstey J.R.; van der Jagt M.; Taccone F.S.; Udy A.A.; Citerio G.; Duranteau J.; Ichai C.; Badenes R.; Prowle J.R.; Ercole A.; Oddo M.; Schneider A.; Wolf S.; Helbok R.; Nelson D.W.; Cooper D.J.; Bellomo R.; Long K.; Rodrigues A.; Lozano A.; Saxby E.; Vargiolu A.; Quintard H.; Guillemes M.; Sisson A.; Allen G.; Baro N.; Kofler M. ,"Background/Objective: Dysnatremia is common in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and may contribute to mortality. However, serum sodium variability has not been studied in TBI patients. We hypothesized that such variability would be independently associated with mortality. Method(s): We collected 6-hourly serum sodium levels for the first 7 days of ICU admission from 240 severe TBI patients in 14 neurotrauma ICUs in Europe and Australia. We evaluated the association between daily serum sodium standard deviation (dNaSD), an index of variability, and 28-day mortality. Result(s): Patients were 46 +/- 19 years of age with a median initial GCS of 6 [4-8]. Overall hospital mortality was 28%. Hypernatremia and hyponatremia occurred in 64% and 24% of patients, respectively. Over the first 7 days in ICU, serum sodium standard deviation was 2.8 [2.0-3.9] mmol/L. Maximum daily serum sodium standard deviation (dNaSD) occurred at a median of 2 [1-4] days after admission. There was a significant progressive decrease in dNaSD over the first 7 days (coefficient - 0.15 95% CI [- 0.18 to - 0.12], p < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline TBI severity, diabetes insipidus, the use of osmotherapy, the occurrence of hypernatremia, and hyponatremia and center, dNaSD was significantly independently associated with 28-day mortality (HR 1.27 95% CI (1.01-1.61), p = 0.048). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that daily serum sodium variability is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in severe TBI patients. Further prospective investigations are necessary to confirm the significance of sodium variability in larger cohorts of TBI patients and test whether attenuating such variability confers outcome benefits to such patients.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.",2021,/,Neurocritical Care,34,3,899-907,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-01118-8,2006867242,#19176,Harrois 2021,,yes
Predictive data signatures in ICU-stratum traumatic brain injury patients: Computational approach,Kim H.; Stevens R. ,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health problem which constitutes a leading neurological cause of death and also results in life-long disability in many survivors. The aim of this study was to identify data signatures in TBI patients recorded in the first 24 h of ICU admission. We tested the hypothesis that these signatures are associated with short term clinical outcomes. Method(s): A total of 4,450 patients admitted to the ICU for management of TBI were selected from the multisite clinical database (eICU) and clinical, laboratory and physiological time series data were extracted. Outcomes were mortality and neurological outcome at discharge. The eICU developed machine learning algorithms were externally validated on an analogous TBI sample in an independent single-center ICU database (MIMIC-III). Model performance metrics were compared with Reference International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and Corticoid Randomization After Significant Head injury (CRASH) logistic regression models. Result(s): The computational models performed well for both neurological outcome prediction and mortality prediction, with test metrics that compared favorably with Reference IMPACT and CRASH scores (Fig. 1). External validation utilizing MIMIC III corroborated the results from eICU for both neurological outcome and mortality suggesting robust generalizability. Top predictive features included age, PTS derived variables, glucose, platelet count, white blood cell count, and Glasgow Coma subscores, all originating from the first 24 h of ICU admission. Conclusion(s): Results indicate that computational models trained with data available in the first 24 h after admission are predictive of shortterm neurological outcome and mortality in ICU-stratum TBI patients. Timely characterization of severity and clinical trajectories could open a window for targeted interventions to ameliorate outcomes in patients with moderate and severe TBI.

Incidence and burden of acute kidney injury among traumatic brain-injury patients,Wang R.; Zhang J.; He M.; Xu J. ,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been occurs commonly in the clinical management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and is correlated with outcomes in these patients. We designed this study to investigate the incidence, duration, stage, and burden of AKI among these patients. Method(s): A total of 419 TBI inpatients at our hospital were included in the study. We calculated the AKI burden, reflecting both stage and duration, and then analyzed associations among AKI occurrence, highest AKI stage, AKI duration, AKI burden, and outcomes with logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Incidence of AKI among TBI patients was 19.8%. These patients' AKIs occurred mainly on the first day from admission (10.74%), and mostly developed stage 1 AKI (9.79%). Modes of AKI duration and burden in those with AKI were both 1. Multivariate logistic regression showed AKI occurrence (OR 3.792, p=0.004) and the highest AKI stage (OR 3.122, p<0.001) was significantly associated with mortality. Neither AKI duration (OR 1.083, p=0.206) nor AKI burden (OR 1.062, p=0.171) were associated with mortality. Incorporating AKI occurrence or highest AKI stage did not improve the predictive value of the constructed prognostic model. Conclusion(s): The high-incidence period of AKI in TBI patients was the first 3 days after admission. AKI occurrence and highest AKI stage were associated with mortality, while AKI duration and AKI burden were not associated with mortality.Copyright Â© 2021 Wang et al.",2021,/,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,14,"(Wang, Zhang, Xu) Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China(Xu, He) Department of Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China",4571-4580,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S335150,2014526767,#19168,Wang 2021,,yes
Serum calprotectin as a prognostic predictor in severe traumatic brain injury,Yang Y.; Shen L.; Xu M.; Chen L.; Lu W.; Wang W. ,"Background: Calprotectin plays an important role during inflammation. We intended to explore the prognostic value of serum calprotectin levels in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Method(s): In this prospective cohort study of 149 sTBI patients, we determined the relationship between serum calprotectin levels and 90-day overall survival plus poor outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3) after sTBI, and analyzed its associations with Rotterdam computerized tomography (CT) scores, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores and two markers of inflammatory reaction including serum C-reactive protein levels and blood leucocyte count. Result(s): Serum calprotectin levels were significantly correlated with Rotterdam CT scores, GCS scores, serum C-reactive protein levels and blood leucocyte count. Patients with poor outcome at 90 days displayed higher serum calprotectin levels than the other remainders. Serum calprotectin appeared as an independent predictor for 90-day overall survival and poor outcome. Under receiver operating characteristic curve, serum calprotectin levels exhibited an efficient discrimination capacity for 90-day poor outcome. Conclusion(s): Serum calprotectin levels are significantly correlated with inflammation, trauma severity and poor outcome at 90 days in sTBI patients, suggesting that serum calprotectin may be a biomarker for providing complementary prognostic information to identify patients at risk of poor outcome after sTBI.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Clinica Chimica Acta,520,"(Yang) Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University, Kunshan 215300, China(Shen) Department of Neurosurgery, Suzhou Kowloon Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Suzhou 266021, China(Xu, Chen",101-107,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.06.009,2012938952,#19161,Yang 2021,,yes
A comprehensive analysis of the association of psoas and masseter muscles with traumatic brain injury using computed tomography anthropometry,Cho H.J.; Hwang Y.; Yang S.; Kim M. ,"Objective: Psoas and masseter muscles are known markers of sarcopenia. However, the relative superiority of either muscle as a marker is unclear. Therefore, this study analyzed the two muscles in patients with a prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method(s): Patients with TBI visiting a regional trauma center between January 2017 and December 2018 were selected, and their medical records were reviewed. TBI patients with an abbreviated injury score (AIS) of 4 or 5 were selected. Patients with an AIS of 4 or 5 at the chest, abdomen, and extremity were excluded. Patients with a hospital stay of 1 to 2 days were excluded. Both muscle areas were measured based on the initial computed tomography. The psoas muscle index (PMI) and the masseter muscle index (MMI) were calculated by dividing both muscle areas by height in meters squared (cm2 /m2). These muscle parameters along with other medical information were used to analyze mortality and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). Result(s): A total of 179 patients, including 147 males (82.1%), were analyzed statistically. The mean patient age was 58.0 years. The mortality rate was 16.8% (30 patients). The mean GOS score was 3.7. Analysis was performed to identify the parameters associated with mortality, which was a qualitative study outcome. The psoas muscle area (16.9 vs. 14.4 cm2, p=0.028) and PMI (5.9 vs. 5.1 cm2 /m2, p=0.004) showed statistical differences between the groups. The PMI was also statistically significant as a risk factor for mortality in logistic regression analysis (p=0.023; odds ratio, 0.715; 95% confidence interval, 0.535-0.954). Quantitative analyses were performed with the GOS scores. Bivariate correlation analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between PMI and GOS scores (correlation coefficient, 0.168; p=0.003). PMI (p=0.004, variation inflation factor 1.001) was significant in multiple regression analysis. The masseter muscle area and MMI did not show significance in the study. Conclusion(s): Larger PMI was associated with statistically significant improved survival and GOS scores, indicating its performance as a superior prognostic marker. Further analyses involving a larger number of patients, additional parameters, and more precise settings would yield a better understanding of sarcopenia and TBI.Copyright Â© 2021 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",2021,/,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,64,6,950-956,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3340/JKNS.2021.0004,2014780825,#19156,Cho 2021,,yes
Atypical symptom reporting after mild traumatic brain injury,Sullivan K.; Keyter A.; Jones K.; Ameratunga S.; Starkey N.; Barker-Collo S.; Webb J.; Theadom A. ,"Objective: Early reporting of atypical symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may be an early indicator of poor prognosis. This study aimed to determine the percentage of people reporting atypical symptoms 1-month post-mTBI and explore links to recovery 12 months later in a community-dwelling mTBI sample. Method(s): Adult participants (>16 years) who had experienced a mTBI were identified from a longitudinal incidence study (BIONIC). At 1-month post-injury, 260 participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (typical symptoms) plus four atypical symptom items (hemiplegia, difficulty swallowing, digestion problems and difficulties with fine motor tasks). At 12 months post-injury, 73.9% (n = 193) rated their overall recovery on a 100-point scale. An ordinal regression explored the association between atypical symptoms at 1 month and recovery at 12 months post-injury (low = 0-80, moderate = 81-99 and complete recovery = 100), whilst controlling for age, sex, rehabilitation received, ethnicity, mental and physical comorbidities and additional injuries sustained at the time of injury. Result(s): At 1-month post-injury <1% of participants reported hemiplegia, 5.4% difficulty swallowing, 10% digestion problems and 15.4% difficulties with fine motor tasks. The ordinal regression model revealed atypical symptoms were not significant predictors of self-rated recovery at 12 months. Older age at injury and higher typical symptoms at 1 month were independently associated with poorer recovery at 12 months, p < 0.01. Conclusion(s): Atypical symptoms on initial presentation were not linked to global self-reported recovery at 12 months. Age at injury and typical symptoms are stronger early indicators of longer-term prognosis. Further research is needed to determine if atypical symptoms predict other outcomes following mTBI.

Novel severe traumatic brain injury blood outcome biomarkers identified with proximity extension assay,Fraser D.D.; Chen M.; Ren A.; Miller M.R.; Martin C.; Daley M.; Diamandis E.P.; Prassas I. ,"Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients suffer high mortality. Accurate prognostic biomarkers have not been identified. In this exploratory study, we performed targeted proteomics on plasma obtained from sTBI patients to identify potential outcome biomarkers. Blood sample was collected from patients admitted to the ICU suffering a sTBI, using standardized clinical and computerized tomography (CT) imaging criteria. Age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects and sTBI patients were enrolled. Targeted proteomics was performed on plasma with proximity extension assays (1,161 proteins). Cohorts were well-balanced for age and sex. The majority of sTBI patients were injured in motor vehicle collisions and the most frequent head CT finding was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mortality rate for sTBI patients was 40%. Feature selection identified the top performing 15 proteins for identifying sTBI patients from healthy control subjects with a classification accuracy of 100%. The sTBI proteome was dominated by markers of vascular pathology, immunity/inflammation, cell survival and macrophage/microglia activation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses demonstrated areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for identifying sTBI that ranged from 0.870-1.000 (p<=0.005). When mortality was used as outcome, ROC curve analyses identified the top 3 proteins as Willebrand factor (vWF), Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), and colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Combining vWF with either WIF-1 or CSF-1 resulted in excellent mortality prediction with AUC of 1.000 for both combinations (p=0.011). Targeted proteomics with feature classification and selection distinguished sTBI patients from matched healthy control subjects. Two protein combinations were identified that accurately predicted sTBI patient mortality. Our exploratory findings require confirmation in larger sTBI patient populations.Copyright Â© 2021 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",2021,/,Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine,59,10,1662-1669,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0103,2013389679,#19128,Fraser 2021,,yes
Self-Reported Complaints as Prognostic Markers for Outcome After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Elderly: A Machine Learning Approach,Bittencourt M.; Balart-Sanchez S.A.; Maurits N.M.; van der Naalt J. ,"Self-reported complaints are common after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Particularly in the elderly with mTBI, the pre-injury status might play a relevant role in the recovery process. In most mTBI studies, however, pre-injury complaints are neither analyzed nor are the elderly included. Here, we aimed to identify which individual pre- and post-injury complaints are potential prognostic markers for incomplete recovery (IR) in elderly patients who sustained an mTBI. Since patients report many complaints across several domains that are strongly related, we used an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to robustly deal with correlated predictors and boost classification performance. Pre- and post-injury levels of 20 individual complaints, as self-reported in the acute phase, were analyzed. We used data from two independent studies separately: UPFRONT study was used for training and validation and ReCONNECT study for independent testing. Functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomized functional outcome into complete recovery (CR; GOSE = 8) and IR (GOSE <= 7). In total 148 elderly with mTBI (median age: 67 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 9 years; UPFRONT: N = 115; ReCONNECT: N = 33) were included in this study. IR was observed in 74 (50%) patients. The classification model (IR vs. CR) achieved a good performance (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC-AUC] = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74-0.86) based on a subset of only 8 out of 40 pre- and post-injury complaints. We identified increased neck pain (p = 0.001) from pre- to post-injury as the strongest predictor of IR, followed by increased irritability (p = 0.011) and increased forgetfulness (p = 0.035) from pre- to post-injury. Our findings indicate that a subset of pre- and post-injury physical, emotional, and cognitive complaints has predictive value for determining long-term functional outcomes in elderly patients with mTBI.

Outcome Prediction in Patients of Traumatic Brain Injury Based on Midline Shift on CT Scan of Brain,Palekar S.G.; Jaiswal M.; Patil M.; Malpathak V. ,"Background Clinicians treating patients with head injury often take decisions based on their assessment of prognosis. Assessment of prognosis could help communication with a patient and the family. One of the most widely used clinical tools for such prediction is the Glasgow coma scale (GCS); however, the tool has a limitation with regard to its use in patients who are under sedation, are intubated, or under the influence of alcohol or psychoactive drugs. CT scan findings such as status of basal cistern, midline shift, associated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and intraventricular hemorrhage are useful indicators in predicting outcome and also considered as valid options for prognostication of the patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially in emergency setting. Materials and Methods 108 patients of head injury were assessed at admission with clinical examination, history, and CT scan of brain. CT findings were classified according to type of lesion and midline shift correlated to GCS score at admission. All the subjects in this study were managed with an identical treatment protocol. Outcome of these patients were assessed on GCS score at discharge. Results Among patients with severe GCS, 51% had midline shift. The degree of midline shift in CT head was a statistically significant determinant of outcome (p = 0.023). Seventeen out of 48 patients (35.4%) with midline shift had poor outcome as compared with 8 out of 60 patients (13.3%) with no midline shift. Conclusion In patients with TBI, the degree of midline shift on CT scan was significantly related to the severity of head injury and resulted in poor clinical outcome. Copyright Â© 2021.

Serum Progesterone Levels as Predictor of Outcome in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Analysis of Cohort of 100 Patients,Chhiber S.S.; Gul A.; Arif S.; Wani A.A.; Ramzan A.U. ,"Despite advances in research and improved neurological intensive care in recent years, the clinical outcome of severely head injured patients is still poor. Primary insult is followed by a complex cascade of molecular and biochemical events that lead to neuroinflammation, brain edema, and delayed neuronal death. No specific pharmacological therapy is currently available which prevents the development of secondary brain injuries, and most therapeutic strategies have failed in translation from bench to bedside. There are limitations of clinical and radiological methods in delineating the exact severity and prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). A myriad complex biochemical markers are under investigation to delineate the extent of brain tissue damage and to independently predict the outcome, but a search for simple biomarker still eludes the research. Progesterone, a gonadal hormone and a neurosteroid, although controversial as a neuroprotective agent, may hold promise as a simple biochemical marker of the outcome in severe TBI. Copyright Â© 2021.

Sedation-Induced Burst Suppression Predicts Positive Outcome Following Traumatic Brain Injury,Frohlich J.; Johnson M.A.; McArthur D.L.; Lutkenhoff E.S.; Dell'Italia J.; Real C.; Shrestha V.; Spivak N.M.; Ruiz Tejeda J.E.; Vespa P.M.; Monti M.M. ,"While electroencephalogram (EEG) burst-suppression is often induced therapeutically using sedatives in the intensive care unit (ICU), there is hitherto no evidence with respect to its association to outcome in moderate-to-severe neurological patients. We examined the relationship between sedation-induced burst-suppression (SIBS) and outcome at hospital discharge and at 6-month follow up in patients surviving moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). For each of 32 patients recovering from coma after moderate-to-severe TBI, we measured the EEG burst suppression ratio (BSR) during periods of low responsiveness as assessed with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The maximum BSR was then used to predict the Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOSe) at discharge and at 6 months post-injury. A multi-model inference approach was used to assess the combination of predictors that best fit the outcome data. We found that BSR was positively associated with outcomes at 6 months (P = 0.022) but did not predict outcomes at discharge. A mediation analysis found no evidence that BSR mediates the effects of barbiturates or propofol on outcomes. Our results provide initial observational evidence that burst suppression may be neuroprotective in acute patients with TBI etiologies. SIBS may thus be useful in the ICU as a prognostic biomarker.Copyright Â© 2021 Frohlich, Johnson, McArthur, Lutkenhoff, Dell'Italia, Real, Shrestha, Spivak, Ruiz Tejeda, Vespa and Monti.",2021,/,Frontiers in Neurology,12,"(Frohlich, Johnson, Lutkenhoff, Dell'Italia, Monti) Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States(McArthur, Real, Shrestha, Spivak, Ruiz Tejeda, Vespa, Monti) Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Injury Resea",750667,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.750667,636795589,#19086,Frohlich 2021,,yes
Red Cell Distribution Width to Platelet Count Ratio: A Promising Routinely Available Indicator of Mortality for Acute Traumatic Brain Injury,Ge X.; Zhu L.; Li W.; Sun J.; Chen F.; Li Y.; Lei P.; Zhang J. ,"Prognosis evaluation is crucial for the effective management of patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there is still a lack of routinely available blood indicators for mortality risk in clinical practice. To investigate whether blood red cell distribution width to platelet count ratio (RPR) correlates with hospital mortality of TBI, clinical data of 2220 patients with TBI were extracted from two large intensive care unit cohorts (MIMIC-III and eICU Database), and were integratively analyzed using our developed method named MeDICS. We found that higher RPR can be observed among non-survivors than survivors of TBI (p < 0.001). It had a moderately good prognostic performance for mortality with an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7367, which was greater than that of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; AUC = 0.6022). Besides, the nomogram consisting of RPR, GCS, and other risk factors was developed, where 10-fold cross-validation was performed to protect it against overfitting. A Harrell's C-index of 0.8523 was determined, suggesting an improved prognostic value based on RPR. The in vivo experiments further confirmed the association between RPR and neuro-outcome after TBI. It indicated that the continuous change in RPR post-injury is attributed to the development of inflammation, which emphasized the importance of controlling inflammatory response in clinical treatment. Taken together, RPR is a promising routinely available predictor of mortality for acute TBI. The nomogram generated from it can be used in resource-limited settings, thus be proposed as a prognosis evaluation aid for patients with TBI in all levels of medical system.Â© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",2022,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,39,02-Jan,159-171,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7481,636957606,#19045,Ge 2022,,yes
Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury and International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury Models Compared with a Machine Learning-Based Predictive Model from Tanzania,Elahi C.; Adil S.M.; Sakita F.; Mmbaga B.T.; Hernandes Rocha T.A.; Fuller A.; Haglund M.M.; Nickenig Vissoci J.R.; Staton C. ,"Hospitals in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) could benefit from decision support technologies to reduce time to triage, diagnosis, and surgery for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury (CRASH) and International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) are robust examples of TBI prognostic models, although they have yet to be validated in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Moreover, machine learning and improved data quality in LMICs provide an opportunity to develop context-specific, and potentially more accurate, prognostic models. We aim to externally validate CRASH and IMPACT on our TBI registry and compare their performances to that of the locally derived model (from the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center [KCMC]). We developed a machine learning-based prognostic model from a TBI registry collected at a regional referral hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. We also used the core CRASH and IMPACT online risk calculators to generate risk scores for each patient. We compared the discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]) and calibration before and after Platt scaling (Brier, Hosmer-Lemeshow Test, and calibration plots) for CRASH, IMPACT, and the KCMC model. The outcome of interest was unfavorable in-hospital outcome defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3. There were 2972 patients included in the TBI registry, of whom 11% had an unfavorable outcome. The AUCs for the KCMC model, CRASH, and IMPACT were 0.919, 0.876, and 0.821, respectively. Prior to Platt scaling, CRASH was the best calibrated model (chi2 = 68.1) followed by IMPACT (chi2 = 380.9) and KCMC (chi2 = 1025.6). We provide the first SSA validation of the core CRASH and IMPACT models. The KCMC model had better discrimination than either of these. CRASH had the best calibration, although all model predictions could be successfully calibrated. The top performing models, KCMC and CRASH, were both developed using LMIC data, suggesting that locally derived models may outperform imported ones from different contexts of care. Further work is needed to externally validate the KCMC model.Â© Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.",2022,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,39,02-Jan,151-158,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7483,636957691,#19044,Elahi 2022,,yes
Extended Analysis of Axonal Injuries Detected Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Critically Ill Traumatic Brain Injury Patients,Tjerkaski J.; Nystrom H.; Raj R.; Lindblad C.; Bellander B.-M.; Nelson D.W.; Thelin E.P. ,"Studies show conflicting results regarding the prognostic significance of traumatic axonal injuries (TAI) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, we documented the presence of TAI in several brain regions, using different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, and assessed their association to patient outcomes using machine learning. Further, we created a novel MRI-based TAI grading system with the goal of improving outcome prediction in TBI. We subsequently evaluated the performance of several TAI grading systems. We used a genetic algorithm to identify TAI that distinguish favorable from unfavorable outcomes. We assessed the discriminatory performance (area under the curve [AUC]) and goodness-of-fit (Nagelkerke pseudo-R2) of the novel Stockholm MRI grading system and the TAI grading systems of Adams and associates, Firsching and coworkers. and Abu Hamdeh and colleagues, using both univariate and multi-variate logistic regression. The dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale was considered the primary outcome. We examined the MRI scans of 351 critically ill patients with TBI. The TAI in several brain regions, such as the midbrain tegmentum, were strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. The Stockholm MRI grading system exhibited the highest AUC (0.72 vs. 0.68-0.69) and Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 (0.21 vs. 0.14-0.15) values of all TAI grading systems. These differences in model performance, however, were not statistically significant (DeLong test, p > 0.05). Further, all included TAI grading systems improved outcome prediction relative to established outcome predictors of TBI, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (likelihood-ratio test, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the detection of TAI using MRI is a valuable addition to prognostication in TBI.Copyright Â© Jonathan Tjerkaski et al., 2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2022.",2022,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,39,02-Jan,58-66,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2021.0159,636958045,#19043,Tjerkaski 2022,,yes
The ICEBERG: a score and visual representation to track the severity of traumatic brain injury: design principles and preliminary results,Vallee F.; Nougue H.; Cartailler J.; Kounde P.R.; Mebazaa A.; Gayat E.; Azouvi P.; Mateo J. ,"BACKGROUND: Establishing neurological prognoses in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients remains challenging. To help physicians in the early management of severe TBI, we have designed a visual score (ICEBERG score) including multimodal monitoring and treatment-related criteria. We evaluated the ICEBERG scores among patients with severe TBI to predict the 28-day mortality and long-term disability (Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE) at 3 years). Additionally, we made a preliminary assessment of the nurses and doctors on the uptake and reception to the use of the ICEBERG visual tool. METHOD(S): This study was part of a larger prospective cohort study of 207 patients with severe TBI in the Parisian region (PariS-TBI study). The ICEBERG score included 6 variables from multimodal monitoring and treatment-related criteria: cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), body temperature, sedation depth, arterial partial pressure of CO2 and blood osmolarity. The primary outcome measures included the ICEBERG score and its relationship with hospital mortality and GOSE. RESULT(S): The hospital mortality was 21% (45/207). The ICEBERG score baseline value and changes during the 72nd first hours were more strongly associated with TBI prognosis than the ICEBERG parameters measured individually. Interestingly, when the clinical and CT parameters at admission were combined with the ICEBERG score at 48 h using a multimodal approach, the predictive value was significantly increased (AUC = 0.92). Furthermore, comparing the ICEBERG visual representation with the traditional numerical readout revealed that changes in patient vitals were more promptly detected using ICEBERG representation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The ICEBERG score could represent a simple and effective method to describe severity in TBI patients, where a high score is associated with increased mortality and disability. Additionally, ICEBERG representation could enhances the recognition of unmet therapeutic goals and dynamic evolution of the patient's condition. These preliminary results must be confirmed in a prospective manner. STUDY TYPE: Prognostic.

Observed versus predicted outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury using the crash prognosis model,Gonzalez M.I.; Santamarta D.; Valdivia J.; Yague R.; Avila S.; De la Hoz C. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The ability to accurately predict patient outcome after TBI has an important role in clinical practice and research. The collaborators of the Corticosteroid Randomiaation After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) study provided a user-friendly web-based outcome prediction model. External validation is necessary to determine the ability of a model to reliably predict outcome in populations, different from the development setting. Objective(s): To validate the CRASH prognostic model to a cohort of patients with severe TBI when applied to a local context. Method(s): Retrospective study of patients admitted at the Hospital of Leon (Spain) with severe TBI during the 5-year period 2010-2014. This is a tertiary referral centre for a population of half a million people. The source used for case ascertainment was Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. The standard medical management of severe neurotrauma was based on the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines. Outcome assessment was made by reviewing patient files and telephone calls. The clinical and radiological data required for the CRASH prediction model were all collected and entered into the web-based calculator during October 2015. Patients were classified according to the percentage of predicted mortality and unfavourable outcome. We plotted mean observed vs predicted outcome and assessed the performance of the model by logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to assess the discrimination of the model. Discrimination describes how well a model distinguishes between patients with and without the outcome of interest. Result(s): One hundred and fifteen adult patients with severe TBI were admitted to the ICU between 2010-2014. The incidence of hospitalized severe TBI during the period analysed was six per 105 of the population and year. The mean age of the patients was 55 years (median = 56 years, age range = 15-89). There was a male predominance (77%). The mortality at 14 days was 62 patients (54%). At 6 months, the clinical outcome was unfavourable (GOS 1-3) in 85 patients (74%). The mean risk of mortality at 14 days among the 115 patients according to the CRASH calculator was 53% (+/- 32). The mean risk of unfavourable outcome at 6 months was 76% (+/- 23). Conclusion(s): CRASH prognostic model is a valid instrument to quantify prognosis in severe TBI. Furthermore, the model is available in a web-based user-friendly way, making it clinically practical. The model appeared to be more accurately calibrated (i.e. the observed risk was very close to the predicted risk) when the predicted risk of unfavourable outcome was greater than 60%.

Decompressive craniectomy in severe head injury: An ultima ratio measure or not?,Rovlias A.; Paidakakos N.; Siakavella M.; Papoutsakis D. ,"Objectives: Despite various conservative management strategies in the course of treating severe head injury (SHI), control of intracranial hypertension is not always possible. Although several reports have shown the benefit of decompressive craniectomy (DC), its effectiveness remains controversial due to the unsatisfactory long-term clinical results in many patients. This study analyses the various prognostic factors in relation to the late neurological outcome in a series of patients with SHI who underwent a DC to control raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Method(s): From 2004-2014, 155 patients (112 males and 43 females) with closed SHI (GCS <= 8) underwent a DC to control raised ICP. The mean age was 37.6 years (range = 16-78 years). They all underwent a large unilateral or bilateral DC and duraplasty, either during the emergency evacuation of an extraaxial haematoma or due to refractory increased ICP. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) evaluated neurological outcome, at least 1 year post-surgery. Result(s): Thirty-five patients passed away during hospitalization (22.5%, GOS = 1), 23 remained in a persistent vegetative state (15%, GOS = 2) and 32 suffered a heavy handicap (20.5%, GOS = 3). Sixty-five patients (42%) presented a favourable outcome, with (GOS = 5; 27%) or without (GOS = 4; 15%) return to work. Patients with GOS 4 and 5 were younger, had a higher admission GCS score, better pupil reaction and less midline shift in pre-operative CT. They also demonstrated a major ICP decrease post-operatively. The more frequent complications were subdural hygroma and hydrocephalus. Conclusion(s): DC is a well known technique used to be the last resort treatment to decrease ICP and avoid brain stem herniation with secondary brain ischaemia. Indications for this procedure should be progressive intracranial hypertension resistant to conservative treatment in correlation with clinical, neuroradiological and electrophysiological findings. Timing of DC is essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage. In this retrospective study, the functional outcome has been good in more than 40% of the patients that would have probably died without treatment. Hence, our results justify the use of DC. Admission GCS and age are the main variables correlated to long-term outcome.

An audit of moderate-to-severe acute head injury patients in Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital,Thomas A.; George B. ,"Objectives: Head injury is a devastating condition in developing countries like South Africa, contributing significantly to mortality and morbidity. The factors affecting outcome like age, gender, mechanism of injury, clinical, radiological findings and treatment are reported. Their relation to outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score) of treatment is analysed. Method(s): This is a retrospective, descriptive and demographic profile study. The sample group consists of moderate-to-severe head injury patients admitted in the neurosurgical unit of Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital from January 2011 to June 2012. The data includes age, gender, nature of head injury (scalp, skull, intracranial), mode of injury (fall from height, road traffic accident, fire arm injury, assault, blast injury), condition at presentation [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)], pupillary reaction, Computed Tomography (CT) scan findings, treatment received and outcome [Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS)] of treatment. Result(s): A total of 292 patients was enrolled in the study, 258 males (88.3%) and 34 females (11.6%). In the age distribution 50 patients were below 19 years, 161 patients were between 20-39 years, 60 patients 40-59 years and 21 patients above 60 years. The various mechanisms of injury noted were assault in 127 patients, pedestrian vehicular accident in 50 patients, motor vehicular accident in 33 patients, motor bike accidents in four patients, train accidents in two patients, gunshot injury in six patients, fall from height in 35 patients and struck by heavy object in five patients. One hundred and twenty-three patients had a GCS between 3-5, 72 patients GCS between 6-8 and 97 patients GCS 8-12. One hundred and ninety-two patients had equal and reacting pupils after the head injury, 52 patients unilateral fixed pupils and 10 patients bilateral fixed pupils. The Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed 287 patients with focal intracranial findings, 107 with diffuse brain injury and 168 patients with features of raised intracranial pressure. One hundred and twenty-nine patients (44.1%) were surgically treated and 163 patients (55.8%) treated conservatively with medical treatment. The variables age, mechanism of injury, GCS, pupillary reaction, raised intracranial pressure and type of management was compared to GOS and found to be statistically significant. Conclusion(s): The outcome of patients with moderate-to-severe head injury has no effect on gender, but has a significant relationship between age and mortality. The mechanism of head injury has a direct effect on the prognosis with gunshot head having the worst outcome. The important prognostic factors affecting the outcome include: age of patients, severity of head injury (GCS), pupillary reactivity to light and the pathology of the brain CT scan. The unfavourable prognostic factors are: old age, non-reacting pupils to light, severe head injury (low GCS) and raised ICP after head injury.

The influence of the epidemiological and nontreatment variables on neurological outcome in severe head injury,Rovlias A.; Siakavella M.; Papoutsakis D. ,"Objectives: It has long been recognized that the method of clinical management of severe head injuries often creates a remarkable difference in neurological outcome. Moreover, the development of advanced systems of emergency and primary care has minimized medical complications associated with severe traumatic brain injuries. Previous literature suggests the influence and contribution of several non-treatment factors, other than clinical protocols, on patients' outcome. This study analyzes nine prognostic epidemiological variables and their potential relationship to the late outcome in a series of patients with severe head injury. Method(s): Our study is based on 280 patients admitted to Asclepeion Hospital, a regional trauma centre, with severe head injury. Patients with associated major chest, abdominal or orthopaedic trauma were excluded. The sample population was composed of 214 males and 66 females, with a mean age of 38 years; 16.42% of the patients had a history of alcohol intake with road traffic accident (83.21%) as the most common mode of brain injury. Over 50% of the patients were admitted to the hospital within 4 hours of injury; 47.14% of the patients were intubated within the first hour from the time of the accident. All patients underwent a CT scan as soon as possible after initial resuscitation. Only non-penetrating head injuries were included in this study. All variables were individually and simultaneously related to outcome. Neurological outcome was evaluated at 6 months according to Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). Result(s): Severity of injury (GCS) was the best and strongest statistical predictor of outcome. Patient's age, type of head injury according to CT scan findings, time from accident to emergency room and time from accident to intubation had also a statistically significant impact on neurological outcome. Multivariate analysis indicated an overall multiple correlation of R = 0.73, generated primarily from the confounding influence of GCS score, age and CT scan findings. Conclusion(s): The type of patient most frequently encountered in this study was the young adult male, under 40 years of age, involved in a moving vehicular accident. This suggests a potential target group for any preventive measures directed at severe head injuries. In the arena of severe head trauma, where randomization and patient comparisons are frequently difficult, it is important to determine statistically whether reported differences in outcome are due to differences in patient groups or to more effective therapy or to other factors associated with outcome. Thus, predicting neurological outcome is an assimilative and integrative process of various pre-injury, injury and post-injury variables. These also suggest the necessity of continuing evaluative research on emergency care networks which can link together data relating to ambulances, paramedical personnel, physicians, community hospitals and trauma centres.",2016,/,Brain Injury,30,06-May,492,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2016.1162060,614042313,#22633,Rovlias 2016,,yes
Effect of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition on cerebrovascular reactivity in chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI),Kenney K.; Amyot F.; Moore C.; Haber M.; Turtzo L.C.; Shenouda C.; Wassermann E.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Background/Objectives: Traumatic vascular injury (TVI) is an understudied endophenotype of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can be assessed noninvasively by measuring cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). CVR in response to hypercapnia can reliably be measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with excellent spatial resolution. Potentiation of CVR in response to phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibition is a potential prognostic and pharmacodynamic biomarker for therapies that may improve vascular function. Our objectives are to: 1) investigate CVR using MRI-blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) with hypercapnia challenge in TBI and healthy control subjects; 2) assess the correlation between CVR and neurocognitive symptoms and neuropsychological testing in chronic TBI; and 3) assess the effect of a single dose of sildenafil (a potent PDE5 inhibitor) on CVR and TVI in chronic TBI. Method(s): 55 adults were enrolled: moderate/severe TBI (n = 35) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 20). Subjects were 79% male, mean age 39 +/- 9 years, and mean 32 months after injury. Subjects underwent MRI-BOLD with hypercapnia challenge before and after administration of sildenafil 50 mg. A focused neuropsychological battery was adapted from the TBI Common Data Elements, and neurobehavioral symptom questionnaires were administered. The individual TBI neurobehavioral data (mean symptom scores and neuropsychological test Z-scores) were correlated with the individual TBI CVR data [global, grey matter (GM) and white matter]. Result(s): Mean CVR measures were calculated for whole brain (WB), GM and white matter (WM) and were lower in TBI patients than in HC. All CVR measures distinguished TBI from healthy controls (Cohen's d = 0.988, 1.001 and 0.705 for WB, GM and WM CVR, respectively; p = 0.006, 0.006 and 0.048, respectively). Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis yielded Area Under Curve (AUC), as follows: WB CVR 0.744, p = 0.007; GM 0.748, p = 0.007; WM 0.682, p = 0.043. CVR maps in chronic TBI subjects show patchy, multifocal CVR deficits. Sildenafil increased CVR in TBI subjects (mean + 10.9%) compared to HC (p = 0.0005). Of the neuropsychological battery administered, only the Rivermead 13 and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) scores showed a trend for a correlation [NSI correlation with the global CVR is 0.385 (p = 0.052)]. Mean global CVR correlated best with somatic neurobehavioral symptoms in chronic TBI subjects. Conclusion(s): In chronic TBI, MRI-BOLD with hypercapnia challenge reliably distinguishes TBI from HC, with GM CVR showing the largest effect size. Single-dose sildenafil improves CVR in TBI compared to HC. CVR correlates best with post-concussive symptoms. PDE5 inhibitors are a candidate therapy for TVI.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,768,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352615,#22237,Kenney 2017,,yes
Predicting level of functioning one year after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: A systematic review,De Vries V.H.; Ploeg I.; Heijenbrok-Kal M.; Ribbers G. ,"Background: Prognostic studies on outcome after moderateto- severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) usually focus on survival 6 months to 1 year post TBI. In clinical decision-making and planning of allocation of limited resources a more detailed prediction of the expected level of functioning is of paramount importance. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors for level of functioning 1 year post TBI. Objective(s): To systematically review the literature for cohort studies that investigated prognostic factors for the level of functioning as measured with the Barthel index (BI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) or Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) 1 year after moderate-tosevere traumatic brain injury (TBI). Data Sources: Pubmed, Embase, Psychinfo and Web of Science were searched up to march 2016. Review Methods: Articles were selected if the study assessed potential predictors for level of functioning measured with BI, FIM or GOSE in adults at least 1 year after TBI. Inclusion criteria were: persons with moderate or severe TBI based on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 13, post-traumatic amnesia duration longer than 24 hours, unconsciousness longer than 30 minutes and/or visible traumatic brain injury on CT/MRI. Intervention trials, case reports and articles focusing on diagnosis were excluded, as well as articles not written in English or Dutch. Two reviewers independently included articles, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. Levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, inconclusive) were assigned based on quality and number of studies with consistent findings. Result(s): 50 articles involving a total of 22 557 patients were included (mean age 36 years, 76% men). The independence scales used were: GOSE in 30 studies, FIM in 23 studies, Barthel in 2 studies. Significant predictors for a higher level of functioning after TBI were: normal pupil reactions (3 studies; strong), lower intracranial pressure (2 studies; moderate), lower Traumatic Coma Data Bank classification (2 studies; moderate), absence of diffuse axonal injury on FLAIR scan (2 studies; moderate). Not predictive for level of functioning were: gender (10 studies, strong), substance abuse (5 studies, strong) and TAI lesions in T2 GRE scan (3 studies, strong). Due to differences in definitions of outcomes and methods of analysis, most evidence was heterogeneous and inconclusive. Conclusion(s): Available research varies greatly in outcome definition, methodology, and predictors of interest, which causes differences in results and scattering of evidence. Evidence is lacking regarding the prognostic value of cognitive tests, CT parameters, and EEG for the prediction of level of functioning 1 year post TBI.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,796,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352689,#22236,DeVries 2017,,yes
"Incidence of associated medical conditions and treatment complications, and impact on outcome following moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury",Kowalski R.; Haarbauer-Krupa J.; Ketchum J.; Eagye C.B.; Bell J.; Corrigan J.; Hammond F.; Dams-O'Connor K.; Miller A.C.; Hofmann M.; Whiteneck G. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to nearly 300 000 hospitalizations in USA each year. Short-term outcomes have been studied extensively for associations with patient and injury characteristics. How medical conditions are associated is less understood; present concurrently or as complications of treatment, may influence recovery. Objective(s): To assess the incidence of acutely occurring associated medical conditions and treatment complications on outcome for survivors of TBI. Method(s): Patients with moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database (NDB) were evaluated. Medical conditions, identified by ICD-9 code recorded during the acute hospital phase of treatment, were selected and grouped in a total of 75 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) categories, or groupings of categories. Outcome measures include FIMTM and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) at the time of inpatient rehabilitation discharge and rehabilitation length of stay (LOS). The predictive effect of categorized conditions on outcome was assessed using general linear regression, controlling for: age, sex, injury cause (high vs. lower velocity), injury severity (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score < 6), presence of intracranial mass effect and presence of subcortical injury. A Bonferroni correction of 0.0007 was used to determine statistical significance. Result(s): Between May 2007 and December 2013, 3686 patients in the NDB with complete data were included in the analysis. Mean age was 46.1 +/- 20.6 years, 72% were male and 66% white. Forty-four percent of injuries were caused by highvelocity events, 46% of patients followed commands at initial presentation, 20% had subcortical damage and 40% intracranial mass effect. The most frequently co-occurring medical conditions were adult respiratory failure (42%), other nervous system disorder (42%), crush injury (35%), fluid and electrolyte disturbance (32%), pneumonia (19%), dysrhythmia (16%), other bacterial infection (8%) and septicaemia (6%). Predictors of worse functional outcome in multivariable models, with degree of effect on FIMTM total score, include spinal cord injury (-10.5); paralysis (-9.5), coma (-8.9), device complications (-8.9); pneumonia (-7.5), septicaemia (-7.5), other bacterial infection (-6.5) and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (-5.0). Among these conditions, respiratory failure and pneumonia were associated with worse outcome by all measures. Conditions predicting improved outcome and effect on FIMTM total score included: headache or migraine (+9.9), attention deficit disorder (+7.2), alcohol-related disorders (+5.7) and substance-related disorders (+3.9). Conclusion(s): Co-occurring medical conditions and treatment complications are common in TBI and can significantly impact outcome, independent of patient characteristics, injury severity and neuroanatomic features. These conditions include spinal cord injury, paralysis and GI dysfunction. Treatment complications including pneumonia, respiratory failure, device-related factors and septicaemia, predict poorer outcomes. The findings suggest co-occurring conditions, and hospital complications warrant incorporation in prognostic models for TBI and attention during acute treatment for improvement of outcome in these severely injured patients.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,751-752,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352788,#22233,Kowalski 2017,,yes
The prognostic value of the coma recovery scale-revised,Schnakers C.; Vespa P.; Monti M. ,"Objective: According to the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (2010), the Coma Recovery Scale- Revised (CRS-R) meets the highest psychometric standards for the evaluation of severely brain-injured patients. Nevertheless, no data have yet been published on its prognostic value. This study therefore aimed to provide psychometric data as regards the prognostic validity of the scale. Design(s): Prospective longitudinal study. Setting. Neurosurgery unit of Ronald Reagan Hospital (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Interventions and Main Outcome Measure(s): Twenty-one patients with severe traumatic brain injury (Age: 43y +/- 19; time post injury: 25d +/- 11) have been assessed off-sedative drugs using the CRS-R. The outcome has been documented in each patient at 6 months post injury, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Result(s): A linear regression showed that the CRS-R explained most of the variance of the outcome at 6 months (Beta: 0.79; t: 5.68; p <.001) as compared to other demographic variables such as age and time post injury (Beta: 0.15; t: 1.05; p = 0.31). A clear cut-off CRS-R score of 13 with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% has also been obtained for differentiating patients with good outcome (mild to moderate disabilities) from patients with bad outcome (severe disabilities). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the CRS-R has excellent prognostic value and could be used by clinicians to predict the outcome of patients with severe brain injury, at 6 months.

Predicting post-concussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury: External validation and update of an existing model,Cnossen M.C.; Van Der Naalt J.; Spikman J.; Polinder S.; Nieboer D.; Steyerberg W.; Lingsma H. ,"Introduction: Around 10-30% of the mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients develop persisting post-concussive syndrome (PCS). Early identification, and possibly treatment, of these patients is of paramount importance. Prediction models can be used to identify patients at risk, but despite an abundant number of prognostic studies in mTBI, the large majority used small sample sizes and was of poor methodological quality. In addition, none of the developed models were externally validated in an independent patient sample, while this is a crucial step before implementation in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to externally validate and update existing prognostic models for 6-month PCS following mTBI. Method(s): For validation, mTBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15) were prospectively enrolled from three emergency departments in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2014 in the UPFRONT study. PCS after 6 months was measured with the Head Injury Symptom Checklist (HISC). Patients were classified as having PCS if they reported at least three out of eight symptoms according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis of PCS. Prognostic models were identified through literature search and included in the current study if they were: (1) developed in a clinical cohort; (2) assessed 6-month PCS; (3) included predictors of which >=80% was measured in the UPFRONT study; and (4) met at least one of our quality criteria. Only one model met our inclusion criteria (Stulemeijer et al., 2007). In this model, 6-month PCS was predicted by pre-injury comorbid physical problems, early PCS and early post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Performance (discrimination and calibration) was determined, and the model was updated by adding nine relevant predictors in a backwards selection procedure (p < 0.157). The updated model was internally validated using bootstrapping with 100 samples. Result(s): We included 591 patients (median age 51, 41% female), among whom 241 (41%) met the ICD-10 diagnosis of PCS after 6 months. The Stulemeijer model obtained poor discrimination in our data [area under the curve (AUC): 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.64]. In addition, observed outcomes did not agree well with predicted outcomes (Calibration intercept: 1.29; Calibration slope: 0.48). Updating the model resulted in weaker effects for all predictors. Female gender was added to the updated model since we found a significant association with PCS (OR = 1.52; 95%CI 1.04-2.22). The AUC for the updated model after internal validation was 0.75. Conclusion(s): A previously proposed prediction model for 6- month PCS after mTBI performed poorly in an independent sample. After updating the effect estimates and the addition of gender, the predictive performance improved. External validation and further improvement are needed before the current model could be implemented in clinical practice.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,801,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352839,#22231,Cnossen 2017,,yes
Effect of age on the functional outcomes in Southeast Asian patients with traumatic brain injury,Tay K.W. ,"Introduction and Objectives: Age has been recognized as a predictor for poor prognosis in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in some studies. The purpose of this study was to determine if age is a predictor of functional outcomes in patients with TBI. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of all 55 patients with TBI admitted to a single rehabilitation unit over a 1-year period was performed. Baseline characteristics such as age, gender, comorbidities, polytrauma, mechanism of injury, length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), rehabilitation length of stay and discharge destination were analysed. Long-term outcomes were determined using the discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Result(s): There were 55 patients in our study population (age range 18-96 years). Within this population, 27 (49.1%) were geriatric patients (defined as >=65 years). Falls was the predominant mechanism TBI in 20 of these patients (74.1%). Geriatric patients had a lower mean (+/-SD) FIM score (72.5 +/- 30.3 vs. 89.8 +/- 27.4, p = 0.015) and a lower mean (+/-SD) FIM gain (21.0 +/- 19.4 vs. 30.4 +/- 24.4, p = 0.059) upon discharge compared to younger patients. Although a greater proportion of geriatric patients had a lower GOS score on discharge compared to the younger age group (77.8% vs. 57.1%), this was not statistically significant (p = 0.062). Geriatric patients had a lower mean (+/-SD) FIM efficiency (0.87 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.41 +/- 2.80, p = 0.17) compared to younger patients, but this was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in rehabilitation length of stay in the geriatric population compared to the younger population (42.9 days vs. 30.1 days, p = 0.083). A majority of the geriatric patients (74.1%) were discharged home, comparable to that of the younger population (85.7%). Conclusion(s): Geriatric patients with TBI had poorer functional outcomes compared to the younger patient population in terms of lower mean FIM score and FIM gain upon discharge. However, the rehabilitation length of stay and discharge destination to home were similar between geriatric and younger patient populations.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,827,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352852,#22230,Tay 2017,,yes
Risk of depression following mTBI,Boles W.; Kumar S.; Stephans J.; Shah P.; Kumar M.; Smith S. ,"Background: Depression is well studied in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) but there is scarce data on single episode mTBI with depression and prognosis is clouded by umbrella diagnosis of the post-concussion syndrome. There is no predictor other than well-defined risk of depression with a history of depression. Lack of follow-up with mTBI patients, leaves many at risk for developing post-mTBI depression without proper monitoring. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 174 mTBI patients (87 females and 87 males) presenting with a headache to TBI clinic over 4 years was conducted. The criteria for inclusion in this study were a diagnosis of mTBI, with normal radiological findings and persistent physical and emotional symptoms. Participants ranged in age from 14 to 84 years (M = 43.92). Analysis was done to determine risk of depression, post-mTBI, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15 and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Result(s): Taking into account prior diagnoses of depression, it was found that females developed a twofold prevalence of depression as compared to males. In addition, it was found that those who had a prior diagnosis of depression (N = 105) had a statistically higher PHQ-9 score than those who had not been previously diagnosed (N = 69). An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the PHQ-9 scores in mTBI patients with depression and mTBI non-depressed conditions. There was a significant difference in the scores for patients with a previous diagnosis of depression (M = 14.981, standard deviation [SD] = 5.77) and patients with no previous diagnosis of depression (M= 11.387, SD = 7.52) conditions; t(127) = -2.943, p = .004. Temporal correlation was established into groups based on the length of time in new onset depression after mTBI; it was found that incidence of depressive symptoms increased with time since mTBI. In patients with no prior diagnosis before mTBI, it was also found that having an mTBI increased the risk of developing moderate-to-severe depression to 25.90% at 3 months. Discussion(s): Routine follow-up visits on mTBI patients 2 and 4 weeks post-mTBI, in addition to constant vigilance for the emergence of new symptoms of cognitive impairment and depression disorders and early intervention, are not well adapted in clinical practice. This current study supports the need to monitor the patient following mTBI due to the increased risk of developing depression as time progresses independent of diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome. Conclusion(s): The results of this study support the need for reevaluation of current guidelines for psychological monitoring following mTBI. The increased risk of depression as time passes is a serious health issue that should be carefully monitored and prevented in patients with mTBI.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,1006-1007,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352854,#22229,Boles 2017,,yes
Moderate head injury: An outcome prediction analysis in a series of 126 consecutive patients,Rovlias A.; Blionas A.; Melissaris S.; Papoutsakis D. ,"Objectives: Most of the literature on brain injury has focused on the outcome prediction of severe head injuries, in contrast with the few studies that have been dedicated to patients sustaining moderate head injuries (MHIs). An analysis of these patients reveals a significant percentage of morbidity, or even mortality. Deterioration in these patients is generally the result of factors that could be treated, such as intracranial haematoma, cerebral oedema or ischaemia. This study aims to develop an estimation of the probability of outcome in a series of patients with MHI including early prognostic variables. Method(s): This study included 126 patients with MHI (GCS 9-12). Data collected on admission included age, sex, GCS score, cause of injury, duration of loss of consciousness, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, anisocoria, presence of skull fracture, brain CT result, and prior consumption of alcohol. The sample population was composed of 79 males and 47 females, aged 14-87 years. 21.64% of the patients had a history of alcohol intake. 53 patients had a GCS score of 9-10, and 73 patients of 11-12. Anisocoria was presented in 6% of the patients, while 43 patients had a skull fracture. All patients had brain CT on admission and results were simplified to the presence or absence of a haematoma. There was a 15% overall incidence of operated haematomas. Depending on the neurological examination and findings of CT scan, patients were taken to the operating room, to the Intensive Care Unit, or to the High Dependency Unit. Outcome was assessed at 6 months according to Glasgow Outcome Score. Result(s): A preliminary study was conducted in a first group of 70 patients using ten possible variables. By separating outcome into favourable and unfavourable categories, logistic regression analysis identified four statistically significant prognostic factors: age, GCS score, anisocoria and presence of haematoma. External validation of the above model was carried out prospectively in the group of the next 56 patients, showing good discrimination and adequate calibration, but with a tendency to be pessimistic about more severely injured patients. Conclusion(s): Several studies have constructed predictive models for survival after severe injury, but there is not enough published research based on outcome from MHI. Since the majority of patients admitted to hospitals do not have severe injury, reducing mortality and morbidity in patients suffering MHI would have a significant impact. We have derived, checked and validated a predictive model of survival after MHI. Based upon our results, a four-variable model was developed; all variables are simple and easy to measure rapidly in a centre with access to 24-hour CT. However, further studies recruiting larger number of patients are needed for validation of statistical models in MHI.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,986,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352961,#22224,Rovlias 2017,,yes
Extremely severe head injury (GCS = 3): Defining the limits of neurotraumatology?,Rovlias A.; Blionas A.; Melissaris S.; Papoutsakis D. ,"Objectives: Head injury remains the leading cause of death and severe disability in young adults. The most important prognostic factors are age, level of consciousness, presence of intracranial haematomas, pupillary reactivity and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Mortality significantly increases with lowering of GCS score, and with a GCS of 3 there are practically no chances of favourable outcome. This study was performed in order to find if there are patients with a GCS of 3 who have a chance of survival in a series of severely head-injured patients. Method(s): This study included 59 patients with severe brain injury admitted to the Asclepeion Hospital of Athens. All of them were assessed on presentation according to the GCS score as 3 points. The sample population was composed of 49 males and 10 females, ranging in age from 16 to 84 years. 62.7% of patients exhibited an abnormal pupillary response (unilaterally or bilaterally absent). All patients were examined by brain CT scan as soon as possible. An ICP monitoring catheter was inserted in 34 patients and neurological outcome was assessed at 6 months after injury according to Glasgow Outcome Score. Result(s): 42 patients underwent craniotomy within the first 3 hours, including 5 epidural, 28 acute subdural, and 9 intracerebral haematomas/contusions. In the remaining 17 patients, a diffuse brain injury was detected; four of them classified as having a diffuse injury type I. The overall mortality rate was 73%. However, seven patients had a favourable neurological outcome. Of these patients, four were operated on for an epidural haematoma, and three had no abnormalities on initial CT scan. An analysis of these patients' age revealed that all patients who survived with a favourable outcome were younger than 54 years. The mortality rate was 15.2% in the presence of bilaterally reactive pupils and 57.6% in the case of unilaterally/bilaterally unreactive pupils. A further analysis revealed that patients who survived were younger and had lower ICP levels than those who died. Conclusion(s): Advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of severe head injury have led to major improvement of outcome, but a GCS score of 3 has been recognized as a bad prognostic factor, and questions have been raised as to whether these patients have any chance of a meaningful recovery. Our study shows that the successful management of a very severe head injury still remains rare. With a GCS of 3 only patients with a promptly evacuated epidural haematoma or a normal initial CT scan have a chance to survive. Within the population of very severely head-injured patients, the simple combination of age, pupillary reactivity, and CT scan findings appears to predict accurately non-functional outcome in almost 50% of patients.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,988,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617352997,#22223,Rovlias 2017,,yes
Influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor polymorphism on white matter microstructural recovery in mild traumatic brain injury-a radiogenomic study,Narayanan V.; Veeramuthu V.; Ahmad A.A.; Tan L.K.; Hernowo A.T.; Ramli N.; Ganesan D. ,"Introduction: Cognitive outcome following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is very heterogeneous despite the similarity in injury mechanisms. Polymorphism of neural repair and plasticity genes is postulated as one of the reasons for this outcome. Objective(s): To analyse the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genetic polymorphism (Val66Met) on cerebral white matter integrity as seen with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and examine its effect on the cognitive outcomes of patients with mTBI over a 6-month period. Method(s): Sixty-one patients with mTBI [(mean age = 27.08); standard deviation (SD, 8.55)] underwent MR imaging at an average of 10h (SD, 4.26) post trauma along with the assessment of neuropsychological performance at an average of 4.35 hours (SD, 7.08) upon full Glasgow Coma Scale recovery. Results were then compared to 19 healthy control subjects (mean age = 29.05; SD, 5.84), both in the acute stage and 6 months post trauma Results: The independent t-tests results of the acute performance reveal significant changes of domain-specific neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, visuospatial, executive function and overall) in patients with mTBI against the healthy control subjects. The Met carriers had significantly poorer performance in comparison to healthy controls in all domains except the visuospatial function (t(52)= 0.780, p = 0.49). Individuals with the Val/Val genotype had significantly lower performance in the attention domain (t(52)= 4.197, p = 0.000) only. Intragroup analysis between Met carriers and Val/Val group revealed significant difference in the language domain (t (52)= 2.173, p = 0.04) with the Met carriers performing poorly compared to Val/Val acutely. Temporal analysis of the DTI parameters against genetic allele status revealed lower FA values at 6 months post trauma in Met carriers in comparison to the control group. Similarly, the mTBI patients with the Val/Val genotype were also noted to be significantly different from the Met carriers, but to a lesser degree. In the Val/Val group, the temporal delta (delta) within the attention, memory and executive function domain standard scores (SS) were strongly associated with the delta in various DTI parameters of the WM. Alternatively in the Met carriers group, the delta of attention and memory SS strongly associated with mostly the delta of MD and RD values. Conclusion(s): We show that Met substitution of BDNF gene (rs6265) results in detrimental influence on the white matter integrity and neurocognitive performance, specifically in the domains of memory and executive function both acutely and over time. This effect is due to a downregulation of BDNF expression in Met carriers, thus causing a negative effect on neuronal survival and repair.

Predicting mortality after traumatic brain injury: A prognostic model based on admission characteristics,Charry J.D.; Tejada J.H.; Ochoa J.D.; Tejada W.A.; Pinzon M.A.; Solano J.P. ,"Introduction: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a public health problem. It is a pathology that causes significant mortality and disability. Different models have been developed in order to predict the neurological outcomes. Marshall computed tomographic (CT) classification is widely used as a predictor of outcome. However, this grading system lacks useful variables to predict the outcome of the patient, which are subarachnoid/ intraventricular haemorrhage, extradural haematoma and extent of basal cistern compression. We aimed to develop and validate a practical prognostic model that include all the variables above and predict death at 6 months after TBI. Method(s): Prospectively collected individual patient data were analysed. The CT model included midline shift over 5 mm, normal, compressed or absent basal cisterns, subarachnoid bleeding, basal bleeding, intraventricular bleeding, contusion and epidural, subdural or intracerebral haematoma. We considered predictors available at admission in logistic regression models to predict mortality at 6 months after TBI. The performance and accuracy of several model was assessment using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Result(s): A total of 145 patients were recruited for the study, with a median age of 33 (15-85) years, and 86.89% were male. The overall mortality was 24.82%. The median GCS of patients was 6 (3-12). The Marshall CT classification discrimination was AUC = 0.646, Helsinki CT Score discrimination was AUC = 0.724, Rotterdam grading discrimination was AUC = 0.735, all these with a low correlation with the outcome (Spearman's rho < 0.40). Our model showed the best performance and correlation with 6-month mortality: AUC = 0.7755, Spearman's rho 0.4201, p = 0.000. Conclusion(s): Our prognostic mortality CT model showed a great performance and accuracy and can be used to obtain valid predictions of relevant outcomes in patients with TBI.",2017,/,Brain Injury,31,07-Jun,940,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2017.1312145,617362024,#22216,Charry 2017,,yes
Predictive factors for outcome after mild traumatic brain injury-a multifactorial approach (results from the UPFRONT study),Van Der Naalt J. ,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for the majority of TBI and a substantial part of patients shows incomplete recovery. Outcome studies with a multifactorial approach are lacking. The UPFRONT-study is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with mTBI, defined with Glasgow Coma Scale of 13-15, admitted to the Emergency Departments of three Dutch level-1 trauma centres. The aim of the UPFRONT-study is to create a prognostic model for six-month functional outcome combining demographic, injury and psychosocial factors to identify patients at risk for incomplete recovery. Method(s): Information on several injury related and demographic factors was obtained at the ED. Two weeks after injury several questionnaires were used to assess mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List) and posttraumatic complaints. Outcome was assessed six months post-injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended. Result(s): From 2013-2015 in total 1151 patients were included with mean age of 46.5 (SD19.2, range 16-92 years). Almost half of patients (44%) did not achieve full recovery six months after injury. Psychological factors, i.e. early post-injury emotional distress and maladaptive coping in combination with pre-injury mental health, education and age were found to be decisive for outcome in logistic regression analyses (AUC =.80) compared to ED predictors alone (AUC =.72). The presentation will focus on the value of the predictors for six-month outcome, comparing factors that already can be discerned at the ED to information obtained in the postacute phase after injury.",2017,/,European Journal of Neurology,24,Supplement 1,754,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13370,617492003,#22214,VanDerNaalt 2017,,yes
CBF enhances accuracy of impact prognostic calculator,Stippler M.; Davis R.; McAvoy M. ,"Background: Being able to predict prognosis in severe TBI patients accurately has proven to be difficult. An unbiased prognosis is imporatnt for an informed discussion with family members about lifesaving procedures. The IMPACT Prognostic calculator (IPC) is one of the first attempts to predict 6-month mortality and poor outcome. The AUC has been deemed insufficient by some providers. The purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of the IPC with adding the physiological value of average cerebral blood flow(CBF) during the first 12 hours after the injury. Method(s): All patientswith serverTBI andCBFdata within the 12 hours after injury included. Their change of 6-month mortality and 6-month poor outcome were calculated and compared with the actual outcome. The average CBF was added to the IPC and the accuracy of the enhanced model was tested. A likelihood ratio test was performed comparing the models. Result(s): 147 patient where enrolled. 13.6% were female. Most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (64%), fall or jump and assault accounted for 16% each. The median GCS score at presentation was 5. The mean age was 35 years. The C statistics for risk for death of the CORE model was 0.687 and for the CORE+CBF was 0.754 which was statistically significant different (p = 0.0007). The C statistics for death of the CORE+CT was 0.735 and of CORE+CT+CBF was 0.787 which was statistically significant different (p = 0.0015). The C statistics for risk for poor outcome of the CORE model was 0.752 and of the CORE+CBF was 0.787. The C statistics for risk for poor outcome of the CORE+CT was 0.772 and for CORE+CT+CBF was 0.801. Both were statistically significant different p = 0.0116 and p = 0.0038 respectively. Conclusion(s): We concluded that adding a brain specific physiological measure like CBF to the IMPACT Prognostic calculator helps to improve accuracy of 6 month outcome prediction in patients with severe TBI.

Using classification regressions trees to evaluate clinical and systemic biomarker risk factors for traumatic brain injury mortali,Kumar R.; Wang Z.; Ranganathan P.; Wagner A. ,"Mortality rates after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are considerable. However, few models accurately predict TBI-associated mortality risk, thereby limiting how to apply reliable baseline risk stratification methods to clinical trials. This knowledge gap may partially explain historical failures with identifying effective TBI neuroprotective agents with previous clinical trials. Classification Regression Trees (CRT) utilize decision-learning to determine optimal variables, and corresponding cut-points that are hierarchically ordered according to their prognostication capacity to discriminate clinical outcomes. We leveraged CRT to determine demographic, clinical (head/non-head injury severity), and acute systemic biomarkers known previously associated with mortality [estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), E2:T ratio, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)], and the CNS marker S100b, to predict 6-month mortality among N= 188 individuals with severe TBI. There was a 26.6% overall 6-mo mortality rate. A preliminary CRT showed the strongest mortality predictor was age -42; therefore, primary analyses included two agestratified CRT for those above (N = 73) and below (N = 115) age 42. The model for age <42 captured area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. S100b was the strongest predictor (cut-point: 10.9pg/mL), with higher levels increasing mortality risk. Among those with high S100b, high E2 (cut-point: 109.5pg/mL) was associated with greater mortality risk. Whereas those with lower S100b (< 10.9 pg/mL), high TNFa (cutpoint: 21.2 pg/mL) and less non-head injury severity was associated with mortality. The model for age >=42 captured an AUC of 0.90. GCS above/below 6 was the strongest predictor. Among those with GCS <6, more men died than women. For those with GCS >=6, higher TNFa (cut-point: 11.3 pg/mL), followed by less severe non-head injury severity, was associated with mortality. CRT generated strong mortality baseline mortality risk models. However, mortality risk captured by systemic and CNS biomarkers varies considerably by age. Similar methodologies may be considered for early assessment of baseline mortality risk to facilitate pre-randomization cohort stratification with clinical trials.",2017,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,34,13,A102,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.29011.abstracts,617551963,#22209,Kumar 2017,,yes
Variation in genes encoding candidate biomarkers are associated with neurological outcomes after severe TBI,Puccio A.; Osier N.; Conley Y.; Okonkwo D. ,"Objectives: Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are being actively pursued, with promising candidates including glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), and Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1). The relationship between biomarker-encoding genes and TBI outcomes remains unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore variation in 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in biomarker-encoding genes as predictors of neurological outcome in a population of adults with severe TBI. Method(s): Severe TBI participants (n = 305) were consented through an IRB-approved protocol by proxy. DNA was extracted and SNPs were genotyped using iPLEX MassARRAY multoplex assay platform. Glasgow Outcomes Scale (GOS) score was assesed at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-injury by a trained neuropsychological technician. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) and determine the odds of having a lower score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS 3-5 vs. 6-8) and GOS ( = 1-2 vs. 3-5) based on variant allele presence, while controlling for confounders. Result(s): Possessing the variant allele of one GFAP SNP (rs3785891; OR= 0.58; p = 0.03); was associated with higher admission GCS score as was the variant allele of one S100B SNP (rs2839365; OR= 0.52; p = 0.01). Possessing the variant allele of a second S100B SNP (rs1051169) was associated with higher scores on the GOS at 3 months (OR = 0.39; p = 0.04), 6 months (OR = 0.34; p = 0.02), 12 months (OR = 0.32; p = 0.02), and 24 months (OR = 0.30; p = 0.02) post-severe TBI.

Preinjury medical comorbidities are associated with persistent postconcussional symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury,Yue J.; Cnossen M.; Winkler E.; Sharma S.; Deng H.; Robinson C.; Lingsma H.; Valadka A.; Okonkwo D.; Manley G. ,"Over 70% of traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (mTBI), which present heterogeneously, leading to challenges in management and prognosis. Improved characterization of baseline medical comorbidities may delineate their status as risk factors for unfavorable recovery. Patients from the TRACK-TBI Pilot study with Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15, completing three-and six-month outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE); Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE): physical/cognitive/sleep/emotional subdomains) were extracted. Presence/absence of 12 preinjury medical comorbidities and intracranial pathology on acute computed tomography (CT) were considered. Statistical significance was assessed at p < 0.001 correcting for multiple comparisons. Two-hundred sixty mTBI patients were aged 44.0 - 18.7-years, 70.4%-male, 78.6%-Caucasian; 36.2% were CT-positive. Comorbidities of highest incidence were psychiatric-30.0%, cardiac-20.4%, gastrointestinal-15.8%, asthma-13.1%, headache/migraine-11.5%, seizures-8.5%. Overall three-and six-month GOSE were 6.83 - 1.14, 6.92 - 1.13 respectively. ACE symptomatology did not differ significantly between CT-positive/ negative groups. In CT-negative patients, psychiatric-history associated with decreased three-and six-month GOSE (p = 0.001); seizurehistory associated with decreased six-month GOSE (p = 0.001). At three-months, increased ACE-physical symptomatology associated marginally with gastrointestinal-history (p = 0.004), increased ACEcognitive symptomatology associated with seizure-history (2.53-vs.-1.12-symptoms; p<0.001), ACE-sleep symptomatology associated with gastrointestinal-history (1.56-vs.-0.77-symptoms;p = 0.001) and headache/migraine-history (1.58-vs.-0.76-symptoms;p<0.001), ACEemotional symptomatology associated with headache/migrainehistory (2.04-vs.-0.91-symptoms;p<0.001) and marginally with seizure-history (p = 0.003). At six-months, ACE-physical associated with headache/migraine-history (5.08-vs.-2.71-symptoms; p < 0.001) and marginally with seizure-history (p = 0.003), ACE-sleep associated marginally with hepatic-history (p = 0.005), and ACE-emotional associated with seizure-history (2.79-vs.-1.37-symptoms;p<0.001). Psychiatric-history associated with increased symptomatology across all ACE subdomains at three-and six-months (range: 0.71-to-2.36 mean increase in symptom number; p<0.001).

Increased serum miRNAs as potential diagnosis and prognosis biomarker for human mild traumatic brain injury,Song J.-X.; Bu X.-M.; Wang C.; Wu J.; Wang J.-J. ,"Objective: Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging disease biomarkers. However, comprehensive characterization of the serum miRNA profile in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has rarely been reported. Our study aims to investigate the value of novel serum miRNAs for diagnosing TBI, especially mTBI, and further predicting therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcome. Method(s): ATaqMan LowDensityArray was initiated to analyzed the expression of 754 serum miRNAs in two pooled samples from 15 severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) (GlasgowComaScale [GCS] score <= 8) patients with unfavorable outcome and 15 normal controls. Markedly upregulated miRNAs in sTBI cases were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR in another cohort consisting of 85 with severe TBI, 85with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (GlasgowComa Scale [GCS] score > 12) and 85 controls arranged in two stages. Clinical outcome was evaluated at 6 months using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. An unfavorable outcome was defined asGOS of 1-3anda favorable outcome was named as GOS of 4-5.

Lower order variables used as prognostication variables included age at injury, premorbid education, occupational category, and productivity, with age at injury being the most proximal predictor when more than one emerged. Generally, patients who spent fewer days in PTA, were younger at injury, employed or productive, and had achieved higher levels of education had better outcomes.

Our current knowledge is derived from clinical trial databases, which may suffer from recruitment bias. Therefore our aim was to establish importance ranking for admission parameters in predicting clinical outcome using a single centre dataset. Design(s): Single centre retrospective study. Subjects: We included 10 admission variables (clinical assessment, laboratory parameters and imaging findings) for 376 patients from a single centre dataset. Method(s): Missing variables were imputed using chained equations, ranking was based on percent drop in Nagelkerke R2. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at 6months and predictions were made using logistic regression models with k-fold cross validation. Model performance was assessed based on area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and compared using DeLongs test.

Cleaved Tau Protein: A Novel Biomarker Candidate in Mild Neurotrauma in Emergency Settings,Pandey S.; Singh K.; Pandey D.; Chand G.; Sharma V.; Jha R.P.; Singh R.; Rai S.K.; Gupta R. ,"Background Neurotrauma has been labeled as a silent epidemic affecting both the developed and the developing nations. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans leads to the proteolytic cleavage of tau protein called cleaved tau (C-tau) protein. The objectives of the study are to the role of serum cleaved tau (C-tau/tau C) protein as a biomarker in patients with mild TBI and correlate it with the clinical progression (GCS) and clinical outcome (GOS) in emergency settings. Materials and Methods The study has been approved by the institutional ethical committee. The study included 40 cases with mild TBI and 40 controls. C-tau protein levels were measured in venous samples in emergency using human cleaved microtubule-associated protein tau ELISA kit (by CUSABIO). Results The mean serum C-tau protein level in cases was 44.76 +/- 23.10 pg/mL (range: 12.32-96.44, 95% CI: 37.37-52.15) and controls was 33.82 +/- 13.65 pg/mL, (range: 2.48-66.54, 95% CI: 29.46-38.19, p = 0.091). At admission the mean serum C-tau level was 65.15 +/- 22.41, 43.87 +/- 9.67, 26.15 +/- 9.13 pg/mL in patients with GCS 13, 14, and 15, respectively.

Predictive factors of survival and 6-month favorable outcome of very severe head trauma patients; a historical cohort study,Vathanalaoha K.; Oearsakul T.; Tunthanathip T. ,"Introduction: Very severe head trauma cases, defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of less than 6, have a higher mortality rate and poorer outcome. The purpose of this study was to recognize factors associated with survival and 6-month favorable outcome of very severe head trauma patients presenting to emergency department. Method(s): In this historical cohort study, the authors retrospectively reviewed medical records of head trauma patients who were admitted to the emergency department with post-resuscitation GCS scores of less than 6. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the association between various parameters with survival and 6-month outcome. Result(s): 103 cases with themean age of 39 +/- 16.5 years were studied (80% male). The overall survival rate was 41.7%and the rate of 6-month favorable outcome was 28.2%.

Air Versus Ground Transportation in Isolated Severe Head Trauma: A National Trauma Data Bank Study,Aiolfi A.; Benjamin E.; Recinos G.; De Leon Castro A.; Inaba K.; Demetriades D. ,"Background: The effect of prehospital helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) on mortality has been analyzed previously in polytrauma patients with discordant results. Objective(s): Our aim was to compare outcomes in patients with isolated severe blunt traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) transported by HEMS or ground emergency medical services (GEMS). Method(s): We conducted a National Trauma Data Bank study (2007-2014). All adult patients (>=16 years old) who sustained an isolated severe blunt TBI and were transported by HEMS or GEMS were included in the study. Result(s): There were 145,559 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 116,391 (80%) patients were transported via GEMS and 29,168 (20%) via HEMS. Median transportation time was longer for HEMS patients (41 vs. 25 min; p < 0.001). HEMS patients were more likely to have hypotension (2.7% vs. 1.5%; p < 0.001), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 9 (38.2% vs. 10.9%; p < 0.001), and head Abbreviation Injury Scale (AIS) score of 5 (20.1% vs. 9.7%; p < 0.001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified age >= 65 years old, male sex, hypotension, GCS score < 9, prehospital intubation, and head AIS scores 4 and 5 as independent predictors of mortality. Helicopter transportation was independently associated with improved survival (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.67; p < 0.001). Admission to a Level I trauma center was an independent predictor of survival (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.53-0.82; p = 0.001). Regardless of head AIS, helicopter transport was an independent predictor of survival (AIS 3: OR 0.35; p < 0.001; AIS 4: OR 0.44; p < 0.001; AIS 5: OR 0.76; p < 0.001). A prolonged transport time was not an independent predictor of mortality.

Recent imaging and molecular biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for improved TBI precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. Complete integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and patient stratification remains an unmet challenge. Methods and findings: The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP1), and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2). Conclusion(s): TDA identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in TBI patients.Copyright Â© 2017 Nielson et al.",2017,/,PLoS ONE,12,3,e0169490,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169490,614649057,#21794,Nielson 2017,,yes
Red cell distribution width and neurologic outcome in traumatic brain injury: Comparison to crash,Sadaka F.; Doctors N.; Pearson T.; Snyders B.; O'Brien J. ,"Learning Objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Red cell distribution (RDW) is an expression of the variation in size of the red blood cells in an individual patient. RDW is reflective of inflammation. The role of RDW as a prognostic biomarker for neurologic outcome in TBI patients is unknown. Based on the CRASH trial database, a prognosis calculator (CRASH) has been developed for the prediction of neurologic outcome in patients with TBI. CRASH incorporates age, GCS, pupils' reactivity to light, findings on head CT scan, and presence of major extracranial injury in its calculations. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between RDW on day 1 of TBI and neurologic outcome at 6 months based on Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and to compare outcome prediction from RDW to that from CRASH. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients with TBI and a GCS score of 14 or less between 1/2013 and 9/2016. Day 1 RDW and CRASH data were extracted. CRASH was calculated for each patient. Outcome was defined based on GOS at 6 months, with poor outcome defined as GOS of 1-3. Patients were stratified according to RDW values into 6 groups, and according to CRASH values into 6 groups (see below). Result(s): We identified a total of 416 patients. RDW was a strong predictor of outcome: Compared to RDW < 13% group, 13-13.9% (odds ratio [OR] 8.0, p = .005); 14-14.9% (OR 18, p < .0001); 15-15.9% (OR 10, p < .001); 16-16.9% (OR 4.3, p = .03), and > 17% (OR 6.7, p < .01). CRASH was also a strong predictor of outcome: Compared to CRASH < 10 group, 11-30 (OR 2, p = 0.1), 31-50 (OR 6, p = .01), 51-70 (OR 16, p = .0001), 71-90 (OR 41, p < .0001), and > 90 (OR 77, p < .0001). Estimating the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) showed that CRASH was a better predictor compared to RDW (AUC = 0.85 +/- 0.02 for CRASH compared to 0.76 +/- 0.03 for RDW (p = 0.005). Conclusion(s): Both RDW on day 1 and CRASH calculator are strong predictors of 6 month outcome in TBI patients, although CRASH calculator remains a better predictor.",2018,/,Critical Care Medicine,46,Supplement 1,375,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000528792.69174.be,620081486,#21763,Sadaka 2018,,yes
TRPM-4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms correlate with cerebral edema in traumatic brain injury,Jha R.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.; Zusman B.; Koleck T.; Wallisch J.; Shutter L.; Kochanek P.; Conley Y. ,"Learning Objectives: Cerebral edema in TBI is a complex consequence of multiple variables including injury mechanism/severity, and different underlying pathophysiologies. It is associated with unfavorable outcome. Genetic variability explains some clinical heterogeneity in edema formation/resolution and may be valuable for predictive/prognostic enrichment. Sulfonylurea-receptor-1 upregulation (Sur1) increases edema via sodium influx through the TRPM4 cation channel. Inhibition of this channel by glyburide has shown clinical promise. ABCC8 genetic variability (encoding Sur1) has been reported to predict outcome. We hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulated channel, TRPM4, predict edema and outcome. Method(s): DNA was extracted from 385 consecutively enrolled severe TBI patients of primarily North American ancestry (CEU). Exomic and non-exomic SNPs in TRPM4 were genotyped with multiplex. Outcomes include cerebral edema measures (mean and peak intracranial pressure (ICP)) and 3-month mortality. Multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender and initial Glasgow-Coma Scale score. Result(s): Eleven SNPs were analyzed. Two SNPs rs8104571 and rs150391806 were associated with edema but not mortality. Homozygous-variants were not present for either SNP in the cohort. In multivariate analysis, average-ICP for rs8104571-heterozygotes was 9.1 mmHg greater than homozygous wild-type (p = 0.000). Peak-ICP was 16.9 mmHg greater in heterozygotes (p = 0.003). For rs150391806, heterozygotes had increased mean (s=7.2,p = 0.042) and peak (s=25.95, p = 0.004) ICP relative to homozygous wild-type. Homozygous wild-type rs1477363 (OR = 0.62, p = 0.037) rs10410857 (OR = 0.59,p = 0.022) and rs909010 (OR = 0.59, p = 0.027) were associated with decreased mortality but not after the Benjamini-Yekutieli correction. Conclusion(s): In a cohort of severe TBI patients, variant TRPM4 alleles increased edema risk, similar to prior reports of the related gene ABCC8, Effect sizes were large and could have clinical implications. Different TRPM4 SNPs may be associated with decreased mortality, possibly suggesting an independent neuroprotective pathway. Since glyburide inhibits the Sur1-Trpm4 channel, these results may lay groundwork for risk stratification, treatment responder classification, and prognosis in TBI and other neurological disorders.",2018,/,Critical Care Medicine,46,Supplement 1,378,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000528798.99668.28,620081720,#21762,Jha 2018,,yes
Lower cerebrospinal fluid n-acetylaspartate correlates with better outcomes post-severe brain trauma,Osier N.; Poloyac S.; Okonkwo D.; Puccio A.; Conley Y. ,"Learning Objectives: N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a free amino acid produced during central nervous system (CNS) metabolism. NAA is used as a proxy for neuronal viability and overall neuron density in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies. The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of NAA and the extent of disability after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unknown. Method(s): Individuals who had ventriculostomies placed after severe TBI were recruited (n = 28) for this study; CSF was passively drained and the bag removed every 12 hours for 5 days after injury. NAA was quantified in CSF using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Participants were followed prospectively out to 24 months post-injury and long-term neurological outcomes assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS). The relationship between daily and average NAA levels and scores on the GOS and DRS at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-injury were explored using Spearman's rank order correlation. Result(s): In this pilot study, better neurological functioning assessed on the GOS and DRS was found in individuals with lower average CSF NAA levels acutely after TBI (i.e. average NAA concentration was inversely correlated with GOS at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-mo: p = 0.010, p = 0.041, p = 0.007, and p = 0.002, respectively; average NAA levels were positively correlated with DRS at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-mo: p = 0.005, p = 0.005, p = 0.013, and p = 0.007, respectively). Lower daily NAA values from the first to fifth days after severe TBI were also significantly correlated with better outcomes on the GOS and DRS (data not shown, but will be displayed in tabular form if the abstract is accepted for presentation). The results of this study add to a growing body of neuroimaging evidence that raw NAA values and ratios of NAA to other metabolites (e.g. creatinine, choline) are altered both acutely and chronically after TBI, warranting additional exploration. Conclusion(s): The findings of the present study add to a growing body of neuroimaging evidence that suggests neurometabolism and NAA levels are altered after brain trauma. While past published MRS studies suggest intracellular NAA is reduced both acutely and chronically after TBI, the present study adds to this evidence by showing increased extracellular NAA within the CSF after TBI. Together, these lines of inquiry may lead to improved clinical diagnosis and prognosis of TBI and may also support improved identification and evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies.",2018,/,Critical Care Medicine,46,Supplement 1,768,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000529568.87261.73,620080472,#21753,Osier 2018,,yes
The prognostic factors of benign cranial trauma,Ulrich M.V.; Khalid K. ,"Introduction: Benign cranial trauma is a major public health problem due to both its frequency and the health costs it creates. The aim of this study was to identify relevant clinical factors that could predict the achievement of brain CT and situations at risk for neurosurgical care and for which CT was a necessity. Patients and Methods: This is a 24 month prospective study, including 404 patients with benign traumatic brain injury (Glasgow coma score GCS >= 13), patients under 16 years of age and patients with GCS < 13 were excluded. Epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary parameters were studied. A multivariate and univariate statistical study was carried out to reveal the predictive factors of a CT anomaly and the predictive factors for the neurosurgical care. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 16.0 and Excel 2007 software. Result(s): The average age of patients was 34 years with a predominance of male, and sex ratio of 4.05. The cause of the BTB was mainly represented by the accidents of the public road in 73.27% of the cases. 28.22% of the patients were asymptomatic, the most common symptomatology was dominated by the initial loss of consciousness (52.72%), headache (35.64%). The Glasgow Coma Score was distributed as follows-GCS 15 (54.95%), GCS 14 (35.9%) and 13 (9.15%). 38.9% of patients had clinical signs of trauma to the skulland or face. Brain CT was performed in 88.4% of patients, and 25.5% had abnormal CT. The use of neurosurgical care was of the order of 3.22%. In univariate analysis-the predictive factors for a CT abnormality were the Intoxication during the brain trauma, the GCS < 15, Signs of trauma in the skull face, the vomiting, the Initial loss of consciousness, the Comitial crisis and the predictive factors of neurosurgical care were the GCS < 15, the anisocoria, Headache, the vomiting, the amnesia, the Initial loss of consciousness, the Comitial crisis, the anormal CT, the Extradural hematoma or the Subdural hematomat In multivariate analysis-the predictive factors for a CT abnormality were the GCS < 15, the Initial loss of consciousness and the predictive factors for the use of neurosurgical care were the GCS < 15, Signs of trauma in the skull face, the amnesia, the Comitial crisis, the HSD.

"Acute serum GFAP, NF-L, Tau, and UCH-L1 predict CT pathology and 3-month outcome in TBI",Podell J.; Korley F.; Yue J.; Wilson D.; Ferguson A.; Yuh E.; Mukherjee P.; Wang K.; Valadka A.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.; Manley G.; Diaz-Arrastia R. ,"Objective: Assess the utility of serum biomarkers GFAP, NF-L, Tau, and UCHL1 in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Background(s): The glial protein GFAP and the neuronal protein UCH-L1 have been widely studied as biomarkers of TBI. The axonal biomarkers Tau and NFL have also been evaluated, but the relationships between these markers are not known. Design/Methods: Serum levels of the above biomarkers were measured using Simoa 4-plex assays (Quanterix, Lexington, MA) in a cohort of 107 patients with TBI presenting for evaluation to Level I trauma centers. Samples were collected within 24 hours of injury. Biomarkers were evaluated as predictors of pathology on head CT and of full (GOS-E =8) and poor (GOS-E <5) recovery at 3 and 6 months. Result(s): All biomarkers correlated moderately with each other (p<0.001), with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.43 to 0.7 (GFAP + UCH-L1: r=0.70; Tau + UCH-L1: r=0.61; NF-L + UCH-L1: r=0.59; GFAP + Tau: r=0.47; NF-L + Tau: r=0.43). All biomarkers were strongly predictive of head CT pathology (AUC for GFAP: 0.8732; NFL: 0.8298; Tau: 0.7718; UCH-L1: 0.801). Biomarkers were better at predicting poor outcome (GOS-E <5), compared to full recovery (GOSE = 8). NF-L was the best predictor of 3-month poor outcome (AUC 0.8361), followed by Tau (0.811), UCH-L1 (0.7907), and GFAP (0.7632). At 6 months, Tau was the best predictor (0.7569), followed by UCH-L1 (0.6542), NF-L (0.6171) and GFAP (0.5708). Combining all four biomarkers yielded prediction models with AUC of 0.8182 for poor outcome at 3 months and 0.7042 at 6 months. Conclusion(s): Higher serum concentrations of GFAP, NF-L, Tau, and UCH-L1 predicted CT pathology and portended poorer prognosis. The neuronal markers performed better than the glial marker GFAP in predicting prognosis.

Modeling the return to consciousness after severe TBI at a large academic Level 1 trauma center,Winans N.; Liang J.; Doyle S.; Fry A.; Fiore S.; Mikell C. ,"Introduction: Command following is used as a proxy for consciousness in the clinical setting, and time to command following is an important indicator of long-term outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients. We sought to characterize the natural history of coma recovery and identify factors that significantly predict the duration of unconsciousness. Method(s): Retrospective data were collected from 360 sTBI patients. Of 214 survivors (59.4%), 184 patients (86%) followed commands as inpatients. Data were collected on time to command following, demographics, Glasgow Coma Scales (GCS) on admission, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), initial pupil reactivity and initial CT scans. CT scans were scored using the Marshall classification system. Result(s): Return to consciousness following a severe head injury displayed an exponential distribution (M = 10.4 +/- 0.8 days, p < 0.05). Implementing a multiple linear regression model, we identify a model that significantly predicts time to command follow using ISS and Marshall scores (p < 0.01). This model explains 13.9% of the variance in time to command following. Variables that did not significantly contribute include initial GCS, pupil reactivity, age, gender, or type of injury (all p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Here we describe the behavior of emergence of consciousness following head injury fits an exponential function. We also identify a multiple linear regression model that significantly predicts the time to command following based on ISS and Marshall scores.

Genesis of antibiotic resistance (AR) XXXIX: Universal implementation of simplified acute physiology score (SAPS-II) score inclusive of AR as an effective prognostic indicator of mortality in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) induced Coma,Villarreal D.; Munoz-Chacon J.E.; Gayton E.; Ledezama C.; Martinez A.; Contreras L.; Rosales D.; Mendoza J.; Galindo R.; Pope M.; Fuentes L.; Clark S.; Soto M.; Nunez P.; Kannan S. ,"Based on an appraisal of the criteria required for deriving the SAPS-II scores reinforced by statistical significance, a rationale is presented to include factors determining AR, thus enable the clinical decision making to withdraw life support in TBI subsequent to coma (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranging from a Severe: GCS 3-8; Moderate: GCS 9-12; Mild: GCS 13-15). The SAPS-II is a severity score and mortality estimation tool developed from a large sample of medical and surgical patients in North America and Europe. The SAPS II includes 17 variables of which 12 physiological variables, age, types of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical), and three underlying disease variables (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy). Within the first 24 hours of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), following factors which determine AR, are suggested to be included: a. performing a culture and sensitivity lab test on the patient's Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), b. generating an Antibiograms (Antimicrobial Susceptibilities of Selected Pathogens), c. implementation of antibiotics timeout (ATO), and also d. performing antibiotic prophylaxis in case of surgical intervention in TBI is essential for an acceptable neurological outcome. In the event of using the External ventricular device (EVD) for monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP), it is pivotal to monitor the infection of central nervous system (CNS). Acinetobacter baumannii is a known risk factor as a nosocomial infectious agent and associated with high mortality ranging from 15% to 71%. (J Neurosci Rural Pract 2016;7:450-2). Data shows that continuation of antibiotic therapy in TBI with scheduled surgical, or unscheduled surgical cases, are determined based on the detection of AR pathogens causing sepsis. If the patient had antibiotic resistance pathogen including (Colistin resistance) septicemia (Sepsis (Blood Infection) and Septic Shock (J. Neurotrauma 2007;24 Suppl 1: S45-54; Lancet Infect Dis 2009;9:245-55; Infection 2014;42:801-9) a poor neurological outcome is likely. Colistimethate sodium (CMS) as primary or salvage therapy for multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms are known to cause nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in critically ill patients (Ann Intensive Care. 2011; 1:14). Detection of Colistin resistant pathogens in a TBI patient is a reflection of impending septicemia, nephrotoxicity and/or renal failure (associated with poor neurological outcome. Though renal failure depends on the total cumulative dose and duration of Colistin therapy, the severity of TBI, factors such as AR, age, are at a higher risk for nephrotoxicity, possibly a higher rate of mortality. In essence, it is suggested that inclusion of factors causing AR, and SAPS-II scores ranging from 77 to >80 points would be a determining factor in the clinical decision to withdraw life support in TBI patients in ICU by forestalling an irreversible coma. In the event of the patient (TBI) with Moderate: GCS 9-12; to Mild: GCS 13-15, measures to mitigate AR would plausibly increase acceptable neurological outcome with a possibility of recovery (Lancet.1974 Jul 13; 2(7872):81-4); J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2015 Oct; 79(4 Suppl 2): S197-203.",2018,/,FASEB Journal,32,1 Supplement 1,,,,622544094,#21681,Villarreal 2018,,yes

Comorbidity in adults with traumatic brain injury and all-cause mortality: A systematic review,Xiong C.; Hanafy S.; Chan V.; Hu Z.J.; Sutton M.; Escobar M.; Colantonio A.; Mollayeva T. ,"Importance: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. Comorbidity in TBI has recognised to alter the clinical course of patients by affecting selection of healthcare services post-injury, and thereby influencing short and long-term outcomes. While previous research highlighted the types and number of comorbidities among patients with TBI, there remains a paucity of evidence synthesis on the effects of different comorbid conditions on early and late mortality post TBI. Objective(s): The primary objective of this systematic review was to: (1) examine the relationship between comorbid condition(s) and allcause mortality in TBI, and (2) determine the prognostic value of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with a TBI at baseline on the development of adverse or beneficial outcome (i.e., mortality or survivorship) across time. Evidence Review: Peer-reviewed English language studies with longitudinal design in adults with TBI of any severity published from May 1997 to May 2017 was found through Medline, Central, Embase, PsycINFO and bibliographies of identified articles. Eligible articles were identified by two independent researchers using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias in studies of prognostic factors. Finding(s): A total of 25 studies were included, of which 14 were population-based and 11 were clinical studies. Socio-demographic characteristics including age, sex, race, marital status, employment status and insurance status were all discussed as potential predictors of both short- (<=30 days follow-up) and long-term (>30 days follow-up) mortality post-TBI. Comorbidity scales and number of comorbid conditions were not consistently associated with post-TBI mortality. Among the wide range of comorbid conditions discussed by included studies, only stroke and diabetes mellitus were identified as prognostic factors for short- and long-term mortality post-TBI. Conclusions and Relevance: Given the high number of comorbid conditions that were examined by single studies, research is required to further substantiate the evidence and address conflicting findings. Finally, an enhanced set of comorbidity scales that are suited for the TBI population will allow for better risk stratification to guide TBI management and treatment.",2018,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,16,A220,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.29013.abstracts,623884284,#21623,Xiong 2018,,yes
Comparative study of cohorts between isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and associated with polytrauma,Bueno Gonzalez A.; Corcobado Marquez M.C.; Portilla Botelho M.; Hornos Lopez M.C.; Espinosa Gonzalez M.C.; Martin Rodriguez C.; Ambros Checa A. ,"INTRODUCTION. Few has been researched about differences and the prognosis clinical between isolated severe TBI and severe TBI associated with multiple trauma. A priori, the clinical conditions are different, due to the different pathophysiology of TBI in the context of multisystem trauma. Objetives: The objectives are 1o/To know the clinical characteristics and mortality of the isolated severe TBI and TBI associated with multiple trauma. 2o/Determine mortality and associated risk factors in isolated severe TBI. Method(s): Retrospective cohort study using local data collected for the national registry of traumatic patients (Project RETRAUCI) from 02/2013 to12/2016. A comparative study of patients with severe TBI in two groups, according to the presence of isolated severe TBI or severe TBI with multiple trauma was conducted. Given that the objective is to evaluate mortality, severe TBI is defined, all TBI with GCS score < = 8, without other injuries or with non-serious injuries (AIS < 3) in any anatomical region. We defined severe TBI associated with polytrauma, TBI with GCS score < = 8, with severe injury in some other anatomical region (AIS> = 3). Through a logistic regression analysis, predictive factors of mortality are identified. Statistical analysis with STATA software 13.0. Result(s): 54 patients with severe TBI were included in the study, 40 had isolated TBI and 14 TBI associated with multiple trauma. Overall hospital mortality of severe TBI was 29.63% (16 patients). There were no significant differences in mortality between isolated TBI and TBI with multiple trauma (30% vs 28.57%, p: 0.92). There were significant differences in the mechanism of injury, ISS, high base deficit DB and at admission transfusion requirements in the first 6 hours, the latter two being less frequent in isolated TBI.

Association between use of mannitol and hypertonic saline on mortality in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury,Skrifvars M.; Bailey M.; Martensson J.; Moore E.; French C.; Presneill J.; Nichol A.; Little L.; Duranteau J.; Huet O.; Haddad S.; Arabi Y.; McArthur C.; Anstey J.; Bellomo R. ,"INTRODUCTION. Mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) are commonly used for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, their effects on mortality and neurological outcome are unclear. OBJECTIVES. To study the effect of mannitol and HTS during the first three days on mortality in TBI patients treated in the intensive care unit. METHODS. We studied patients included in the Erythropoietin in TBI (EPO-TBI) trial, excluding patients who died before day three. We included the amount of mannitol and HTS administered during the first three days. Severity of TBI was categorized according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IM-PACT) model. Cox regression analysis was used to predict time to death beyond day three until discharge from the ICU. RESULTS. Out of 600 survivals at day three, 76 (13%) later died and 264 (44%) died or survived with poor neurological recovery. Patients who died received on average 67 ml (95% confidence interval [CI] 20-114 ml) of mannitol and those who survived received 18 ml (95% CI 10-26 ml) (p=0.006). The corresponding figures of patients with poor outcome were 18 ml (95% CI 7-29 ml) and 34 ml (95% 18-51 ml) (p=0.04). Patients who died received 277 ml (95% CI 156-399 ml) of HTS and survivors received 226 ml (95% CI 170-282 ml) (p=0.06). Patients who survived with poor outcome received 258 ml (187-329 ml) compared to 207 ml (136-278 ml) in those with good outcome (p=0.44). Independent predictors of time to mortality were proportion of hours of ICP higher than 20 mmHg during the first two days (per 100%) (HR 6.7 95% CI 2.9-15.6, p< 0.001), IMPACT TBI severity (per 10% increase of risk of poor outcome) (HR 1.3 95% 1.2-1.5, p< 0.001), APACHE II score (per point) (HR 1.07 95% CI 1.03-1.1, p=0.001) and amount of administered mannitol (per 100 ml increase) (HR 1.2 95% CI 1.0-1.4, p=0.02). The administered amount of HTS was not associated with mortality (HR 1.0 95% 1.0-1.001, p=0.21) CONCLUSIONS. The amount of administered mannitol during the first two days was independently associated with time to survival beyond day three when controlling for several factors of TBI severity. The role of mannitol in moderate to severe TBI should be studied further.",2018,/,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,6,Supplement 2,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-018-0201-6,624863941,#21569,Skrifvars 2018,,yes
Role of repeat CT in mild to moderate head injury: an institutional study.,"Nagesh, Madhusudhan; Patel, Kautilya Rajendrakumar; Mishra, Ajit; Yeole, Ujwal; Prabhuraj, Andiperumal R; Shukla, Dhaval","OBJECTIVE: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often undergo repeat head CT scans to identify the possible progression of injury. The objective of this study is to evaluate the need for routine repeat head CT scans in patients with mild to moderate head injury and an initial positive abnormal CT scan., METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients presenting to the emergency department from January 2016 to December 2017 with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores > 8 and an initial abnormal CT scan, who underwent repeat CT during their in-hospital medical management. Patients who underwent surgery after the first CT scan, had a GCS score < 9, or had a normal initial CT scan were excluded. Demographic, medical history, and physical examination details were collected, and CT scans were reviewed. Radiological deterioration, neurological deterioration, and/or the need for neurosurgical intervention were the primary outcome variables., RESULTS: A total of 1033 patients were included in this study. These patients underwent at least two CT scans on an inpatient basis. Of these 1033 patients, 54.1% had mild head injury and 45.9% had moderate head injury based on GCS score at admission. The most common diagnosis was contusion (43.8%), followed by extradural hematoma (28.8%) and subdural hematoma (26.6%). A total of 2636 CT scans were performed for 1033 patients, with a mean of 2.55 per patient. Of these, 25 (2.4%) had neurological deterioration, 90 (8.7%) had a progression of an existing lesion or appearance of a new lesion on repeat CT, and 101 (9.8%) required neurosurgical intervention. Seventy-five patients underwent surgery due to worsening of repeat CT without neurological deterioration, so the average number of repeat CT scans required to identify one such patient was 21.3. On multiple logistic regression, GCS score at admission (p = 0.024), abnormal international normalized ratio (INR; p < 0.001), midline shift (p = 0.005), effaced basal cisterns (p < 0.001), and multiple hemorrhagic lesions (p = 0.010) were associated with worsening of repeat CT, neurological deterioration, and/or need for neurosurgical intervention., CONCLUSIONS: The role of routine repeat head CT in medically managed patients with head injury is controversial. The authors have tried to study the various factors that are associated with neurological deterioration, radiological deterioration, and/or need for neurosurgical intervention. In this study the authors found lower GCS score at admission, abnormal INR, presence of midline shift, effaced basal cisterns, and multiple lesions on initial CT to be significantly associated with the above outcomes.",2019,/,Neurosurgical focus,47,5,E2,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.8.FOCUS19527,31675712,#5011,Nagesh 2019,,yes
"Diffuse axonal injury: Epidemiology, outcome and associated risk factors",Vieira R.C.A.; Paiva W.S.; De Oliveira D.V.; Teixeira M.J.; De Andrade A.F.; De Sousa R.M.C. ,"Diffuse axonal injury (DAI), a type of traumatic injury, is known for its severe consequences. However, there are few studies describing the outcomes of DAI and the risk factors associated with it. This study aimed to describe the outcome for patients with a primary diagnosis of DAI 6 months after trauma and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with mortality and dependence at this time point. Seventy-eight patients with DAI were recruited from July 2013 to February 2014 in a prospective cohort study. Patient outcome was analyzed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) within 6 months of the traumatic injury. The mean Injury Severity Score was 35.0 (SD = 11.9), and the mean New Injury Severity Score (NISS) was 46.2 (SD = 15.9). Mild DAI was observed in 44.9% of the patients and severe DAI in 35.9%. Six months after trauma, 30.8% of the patients had died, and 45.1% had shown full recovery according to the GOS-E. In the logistic regression model, the severity variables - DAI with hypoxia, as measured by peripheral oxygen saturation, and hypotension with NISS value - had a statistically significant association with patient mortality; on the other hand, severity of DAI and length of hospital stay were the only significant predictors for dependence. Therefore, severity of DAI emerged as a risk factor for both mortality and dependence.Copyright Â© 2016 Vieira, Paiva, de Oliveira, Teixeira, de Andrade and Sousa.",2016,/,Frontiers in Neurology,7,OCT,178,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2016.00178,613120549,#22734,Vieira 2016,,maybe
Astroglial glutamate transporter genetic associations with post-traumatic seizures,Kumar R.; Ritter A.; Treble-Barna A.; Yvette C.; Wagner A. ,"Individuals with TBI have an estimated 50-times increased relative risk for unprovoked seizure versus healthy age-matched controls. Published studies have identified factors that increase risk for posttraumatic seizure (PTS), like subdural hematoma and craniectomy; however, there remains significant unexplained variance in clinical prognostic models. Variation in genes involved in both secondary injury after TBI and seizure pathology (e.g. glutamate transport/ excitotoxicity), may help address this knowledge gap. SLC1A3, which encodes the glial glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter-1, clears extracellular glutamate from synaptic clefts across astroglial membranes, impacting local bioenergetics, ammonia homeostasis and GABA-glutamine production, which may each lead to increased PTS risk. The study objective was to assess the association between genetic variation in SLC1A3 and time until first seizure over the first 3 years post-injury in N= 267 self-reported White adults with severe TBI and no pre-injury history of seizure disorder. Eighteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were examined for independent associations between minor allele variant carriers and PTS. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was made using the minimum number of effective tests (Meff ) method. Rs4869682 (GG vs. T-carriers) was associated with time until first seizure (log-rank p = 0.003). PTS incidence for GG homozygotes was 29.7% versus 16.9% for T-carriers. After adjustment for subdural hematoma, rs4869682 T-carriers had a 53% reduced PTS risk versus GG-homozygotes (aHR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.89, p = 0.021). No other SNPs were associated with PTS after multiple comparisons adjustment. Our data suggest variation in the glial transporter gene, SLC1A3, is associated with epileptogenesis, such that T-minor allele carriers for rs4869682 are protected against PTS. These study results should be validated in independent samples; though, the relevance of this glial transporter gene in PTS pathophysiology makes it a candidate to use for 1) PTS risk stratification and 2) as a potential treatment target.

Post traumatic headache (PTH) in a cohort of UK personal injury compensation claimants,Lane R.; Davies P. ,"Background: PTH is a recognised consequence of head and neck injuries. It would be reasonable to assume that all victims of such injury would seek compensation for PTH since it is independently unverifiable. Objective(s): We aimed to determine the incidence, headache types, risk factors, treatment received and prognosis for PTH in a cohort of UK compensation claimants. Patients and Methods / Material(s) and Method(s): 116 consecutive claimants were assessed, documenting demographics, severity of head and neck injury, IHC3 classification, and headache duration and management. Past personal and family history of primary headache and previous psychiatric disorder were also documented. Result(s): 88 had suffered head and neck injuries, 21 reported only neck injury and 7 had 'other injuries'. 25% of head and neck injury claimants denied headache. Fewer 'neck only' cases than head and neck injury cases developed PTH (13/21 (61.9%) v 69/88 (78%), p<0.002). None of the 'other injuries' cases claimed PTH. PTH was 'migraine' or 'probable migraine' in 90% and resolved in 30% between 3 and 24 months after injury; but 70% had ongoing headache. Yet 41% had received no treatment for their headache. PTH was correlated with a past history of primary headache (p< 0.00001) but there was no association with head injury severity, loss of consciousness, family history of headache or past psychiatric disorder. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that PTH is fundamentally 'migraine' provoked by head or neck concussion and not a 'secondary headache' as currently classified.

Cognitive Reserve Protects Against Memory Decrements Associated With Neuropathology in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Krch, Denise; Frank, Lea E; Chiaravalloti, Nancy D; Vakil, Eli; DeLuca, John","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cognitive reserve (CR) moderates the relationship between neuropathology and cognitive outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., SETTING: Outpatient research organization., PARTICIPANTS: Patients with complicated mild (n = 8), moderate (n = 9), and severe (n = 44) TBI., DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study., MAIN MEASURES: Cognitive reserve was estimated using a test of word reading (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading). Diffusion tensor imaging (functional anisotropy) was used to quantify neuropathology. Neuropsychological test scores were submitted to principal components analyses to create cognitive composites for memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed domains., RESULTS: At lower levels of neuropathology, people with higher CR exhibited better memory than those with lower CR. This benefit diminished as neuropathology increased and disappeared at the highest levels of neuropathology. Cognitive reserve ceased exerting a protective effect at premorbid intelligence levels below average., CONCLUSION: Cognitive reserve may differentially protect some cognitive domains against neuropathology relative to others.

The statistical analyses indicated the following significant results: the ASHA3 group presented lower severity levels of TBI at the clinical assessment of bronchoaspiration, remained less time intubated (approximately um third less than the more severe group), remained fewer days in hospital and needed less therapy sessions to return to safe oral feeding. The clinical predictor signs for bronchoaspiration that best characterized the groups were the presence of altered auscultation and the presence of coughing after swallowing.

Operative versus non-operative treatment of traumatic brain injuries in patients 80 years of age or older.,"Czorlich, Patrick; Mader, Marius Marc-Daniel; Emami, Pedram; Westphal, Manfred; Lefering, Rolf; Hoffmann, Michael","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults is an increasing issue in modern medicine. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which patients presenting with TBI and 80 years of age or older benefit from an operative treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of an operative treatment in isolated TBI patients >= 80 years of age. Data were derived from the TraumaRegister DGU R from 2002 to 2016. Inclusion criteria were >= 80 years of age, an Abbreviated Injury ScaleHead (AIS) >= 3, and an AISNon-Head <= 1. The cohort was split in operatively and non-operatively treated patients, and outcome was assessed at discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). A favorable outcome was defined as a GOS of 4 or 5. A total of 1.693 patients (431 operatively and 1.262 non-operatively treated patients) were analyzed. Mortality rate was 54.4% (687 patients) in the non-operative group and 49.4% in the operative group. Simultaneously, there were more patients discharged with a GOS 2 (persistent vegetative state) in the operative group (7.9%, 34 patients) than in the non-operative group (1.0%, 13 patients).

Distinct patterns of structural damage underlie working memory and reasoning deficits after traumatic brain injury.,"Jolly, Amy E; Scott, Gregory T; Sharp, David J; Hampshire, Adam H","It is well established that chronic cognitive problems after traumatic brain injury relate to diffuse axonal injury and the consequent widespread disruption of brain connectivity. However, the pattern of diffuse axonal injury varies between patients and they have a correspondingly heterogeneous profile of cognitive deficits. This heterogeneity is poorly understood, presenting a non-trivial challenge for prognostication and treatment. Prominent amongst cognitive problems are deficits in working memory and reasoning. Previous functional MRI in controls has associated these aspects of cognition with distinct, but partially overlapping, networks of brain regions. Based on this, a logical prediction is that differences in the integrity of the white matter tracts that connect these networks should predict variability in the type and severity of cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury. We use diffusion-weighted imaging, cognitive testing and network analyses to test this prediction. We define functionally distinct subnetworks of the structural connectome by intersecting previously published functional MRI maps of the brain regions that are activated during our working memory and reasoning tasks, with a library of the white matter tracts that connect them. We examine how graph theoretic measures within these subnetworks relate to the performance of the same tasks in a cohort of 92 moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients. Finally, we use machine learning to determine whether cognitive performance in patients can be predicted using graph theoretic measures from each subnetwork. Principal component analysis of behavioural scores confirm that reasoning and working memory form distinct components of cognitive ability, both of which are vulnerable to traumatic brain injury. Critically, impairments in these abilities after traumatic brain injury correlate in a dissociable manner with the information-processing architecture of the subnetworks that they are associated with. This dissociation is confirmed when examining degree centrality measures of the subnetworks using a canonical correlation analysis. Notably, the dissociation is prevalent across a number of node-centric measures and is asymmetrical: disruption to the working memory subnetwork relates to both working memory and reasoning performance whereas disruption to the reasoning subnetwork relates to reasoning performance selectively. Machine learning analysis further supports this finding by demonstrating that network measures predict cognitive performance in patients in the same asymmetrical manner. These results accord with hierarchical models of working memory, where reasoning is dependent on the ability to first hold task-relevant information in working memory. We propose that this finer grained information may be useful for future applications that attempt to predict long-term outcomes or develop tailored therapies. Copyright Â© The Author(s) (2020).

Six-month mortality (4.2%-66.7%), unfavourable outcome (GOSE <= 4) (14.6%-80.4%) and full recovery (GOSE = 8) (32.5%-5.9%) rates varied from patients with mild TBI (GCS13-15) to very severe TBI (GCS3-5). Length of stay (8 +/- 13 days) and in-hospital costs (11,920) were substantial and increased with higher TBI severity, presence of intracranial abnormalities, extracranial injury and surgical intervention. Costs were primarily driven by admission (66%) and surgery (13%)., CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality and unfavourable outcome rates were rather high, but many patients also achieved full recovery. Hospitalised TBI patients show substantial in-hospital healthcare consumption and costs, even in patients with mild TBI. Because these costs are likely to be an underestimation of the actual total costs, more research is required to investigate the actual costs-effectiveness of TBI care.",2020,/,Acta neurochirurgica,162,7,1607-1618,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04384-9,32410121,#4700,vanDijck 2020,,maybe
Prognostic Factors for Olfactory Dysfunction in Adult Mild Head Trauma.,"AbdelBari Mattar, Mohamed; El Adle, Hesham","BACKGROUND: Although posttraumatic olfactory disturbances are frequent, they have a poor prognosis. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of clinical factors on the progress of these olfactory disturbances., METHODS: Among patients admitted with evidence of head trauma, only suspected cases of posttraumatic olfactory disturbances were included. Patients were examined by the Sniffin'Sticks test, early posttraumatic and then later after recovery. Such factors as age, sex, olfactory bulb status, and observation period were enrolled in logistic regression analysis, because they are considered to have a possible influence on olfactory function improvements. Amelioration of olfaction was expressed as an alteration in olfactory function to a better level., RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were involved, with a mean age of 38 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 6 months. Twelve patients (17.1%) had olfactory function improvements. In univariate and multivariate analyses, no clinical factors had an impact on olfactory recovery (all P > 0.05) except olfactory bulb integrity, which appears to influence improvement in olfactory function (P = 0.0327 and 0.0293)., CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory bulb integrity, probably the sole prognostic factor for posttraumatic olfactory recovery, where frank damage to such a structure carries a prognosis of poor posttraumatic olfactory function.

Decision tree analysis to predict the risk of intracranial haemorrhage after mild traumatic brain injury in patients taking DOACs.,"Turcato, Gianni; Zaboli, Arian; Pfeifer, Norbert; Maccagnani, Antonio; Tenci, Andrea; Giudiceandrea, Alberto; Zannoni, Massimo; Ricci, Giorgio; Bonora, Antonio; Brigo, Francesco","BACKGROUND: Although the preliminary evidence seems to confirm a lower incidence of post-traumatic bleeding in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to those on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the recommended management of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in patients on DOACs is the same as those on the older VKAs, risking excessive use of CT in the emergency department (ED)., AIM: To determine which easily identifiable clinical risk factors at the first medical evaluation in the ED may indicate an increased risk of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in patients on DOACs with MTBI., METHODS: Patients on DOACs who were evaluated in the ED for an MTBI from 2016 to 2020 at four centres in Northern Italy were considered. A decision tree analysis using the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method was conducted to assess the risk of post-traumatic ICH after an MTBI. Known pre- and post-traumatic clinical risk factors that are easily identifiable at the first medical evaluation in the ED were used as input predictor variables., RESULTS: Among the 1146 patients on DOACs in this study, post-traumatic ICH was present in 6.5% (75/1146). Decision tree analysis using the CHAID method found post-traumatic TLOC, post-traumatic amnesia, major trauma dynamic, previous neurosurgery and evidence of trauma above the clavicles to be the strongest predictors associated with the presence of post-traumatic ICH in patients on DOACs. The absence of a concussion seems to indicate subgroups at very low risk of requiring neurosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: The machine-based CHAID model identified distinct prognostic groups of patients with distinct outcomes based on clinical factors. Decision trees can be useful as guides for patient selection and risk stratification. Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio predicts early growth of traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.,"Zhuang, Dongzhou; Sheng, Jiangtao; Peng, Guoyi; Li, Tian; Cai, Shirong; Din, Faxiu; Li, Lianjie; Huang, Mindong; Tian, Fei; Li, Kangsheng; Wang, Shousen; Chen, Weiqiang","OBJECTIVE: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed to capture the inflammatory status of patients with various conditions involving the brain. This retrospective study aimed to explore the association between the NLR and the early growth of traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (tICH) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A multicentre, observational cohort study was conducted. Patients with cerebral contusion undergoing baseline computed tomography for haematoma volume analysis within 6 h after primary injury and follow-up visits within 48 h were included. Routine blood tests were performed upon admission, and early growth of tICH was assessed. Prediction accuracies of the NLR for the early growth of tICH and subsequent surgical intervention in patients were analysed., RESULTS: There were a total of 1077 patients who met the criteria included in the study cohort. Univariate analysis results showed that multiple risk factors were associated with the early growth of tICH and included in the following multivariate analysis models. The multivariate logistic regression analysis results revealed that the NLR was highly associated with the early growth of tICH (p < 0.001) while considering other risk factors in the same model.

"Antioxidant status of uric acid, bilirubin, albumin and creatinine during the acute phase after traumatic brain injury: sex-specific features.","Zheng, Bie; Fan, Jianzhong; He, Renhong; Yin, Ruixue; Wang, Jinwei; Zhong, Yuhua","BACKGROUND: It is known that the alteration of antioxidants can been seen in early phase after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in order to block oxidative damage, but little is known about the influence of sex on antioxidant system in patients with TBI. This study investigates whether there are sex differences in these endogenous antioxidant agents during the acute phase after TBI and their association with the disease., METHODS: Serum levels of uric acid (UA), bilirubin, albumin and creatinine were measured in 421 individuals included 157 female TBI patients, 156 male TBI patients and 108 age- and sex-matched controls., RESULTS: The statistically significant changes were found in UA, bilirubin, albumin and creatinine for both sexes with TBI, but the trend of changes in bilirubin and creatinine was opposite for gender groups. Serum levels of UA, bilirubin, albumin and creatinine were associated with the severity of TBI patients for both sexes. Male patient subgroups with elevated UA, albumin and creatinine had higher frequency of regaining consciousness in a month. Moreover, addition of UA and creatinine to the established clinical model had significantly improved the predictive performance over using clinical model alone in male patients with TBI. However, no similar findings were observed on female TBI patients., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest sex-based differences in the serum endogenous antioxidant response to TBI.

Role of extracellular glutamate measured by cerebral microdialysis in severe traumatic brain injury: Clinical article,Chamoun R.; Suki D.; Gopinath S.P.; Goodman J.C.; Robertson C. ,"Object. Authors of several studies have implied a key role of glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the place of glutamate measurement in clinical practice and its impact on the management of TBI has yet to be elucidated. The authors' objective in the present study was to evaluate glutamate levels in TBI, analyzing the factors affecting them and determining their prognostic value. Methods. A prospective study of patients with severe TBI was conducted with an inclusion criterion of a Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 within 48 hours of injury. Invasive monitoring included intracranial pressure measurements, brain tissue PO2, jugular venous O2 saturation, and cerebral microdialysis. Patients received standard care including mass evacuation when indicated and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure values. Demographic data, CT findings, and outcome at 6 months of follow-up were recorded. Results. One hundred sixty-five patients were included in the study. Initially high glutamate values were predictive of a poor outcome. The mortality rate was 30.3% among patients with glutamate levels > 20 mumol/L, compared with 18% among those with levels <= 20 mumol/L. Two general patterns were recognized: Pattern 1, glutamate levels tended to normalize over the monitoring period (120 hours); and Pattern 2, glutamate levels tended to increase with time or remain abnormally elevated. Patients showing Pattern 1 had a lower mortality rate (17.1 vs 39.6%) and a better 6-month functional outcome among survivors (41.2 vs 20.7%). Conclusions. Glutamate levels measured by microdialysis appear to have an important role in TBI.

A simple hospital discharge score predicts Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 months in patients with traumatic brain injury,Fuller G.W.; Yeoman P. ,"Introduction: This study examines whether a hospital discharge score predicts future Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Loss to follow-up is a major problem in TBI studies and an early prediction score could be used for interpolation of missing outcome data or as a surrogate outcome measure. Method(s): Adults admitted to the Queens Medical Centre between 1993 and 2002 with TBI and GCS <12 were included prospectively in the Nottingham Head Injury Register. At hospital discharge the modified Barthel Index was recorded by nursing staff and a Discharge Disability Score (DDS) calculated: 1. Independent, 2. Dependent <24 hour care, 3. Fully dependent, 4. Dead [1]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was calculated at 12 months by the patient's general practitioner [2]. Unfavourable outcome was defined as DDS 3, 4 or GOS 1, 2, 3. Correlation between DDS and GOS was measured and the ability of DDS to predict GOS at 12 months in survivors was assessed using logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity of dichotomised DDS for prediction of unfavourable outcome at 12 months was also calculated. Result(s): Data were available on 1,227 patients. A highly correlated linear relationship was evident between DDS and GOS (spearman correlation coefficient 0.77, P <0.0001). Unfavourable outcome measured by DDS showed sensitivity of 73% (95% CI 69 to 76%) and specificity of 56% (53 to 59%) for prediction of unfavourable outcome at 12 months defined by GOS. DDS showed a strong association with GOS at 12 months for survivors at discharge, with fully dependent patients having 15 times higher odds of an unfavourable outcome. Adjusting for known TBI prognostic factors attenuated the strength of the association, however DDS remained a statistically significant strong predictor of outcome. Conclusion(s): DDS is strongly associated with 12-month GOS and could potentially be used to replace missing data or provide a surrogate outcome measure in TBI trials. A valid prediction score may also aid the clinician's ability to discuss patient prognosis at hospital discharge.",2010,/,Critical Care,14,SUPPL. 1,S102,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc8535,70255546,#24539,Fuller 2010,,yes
SOFA-score is predictive of outcome in severely injured patients irrespective of the leading injury,Billeter A.; Turina M.; Duebendorfer C.; Neuhaus V.; Keel M.; Simmen H.-P. ,"Objective: Arterial lactate values, base excess (BE), lactate clearance, and sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) have been shown to correlate with outcome in severely injured patients. How-ever, the patient populations studied are of ten heterogeneous to the type of injury, and the role of the above parameters in different subsets of trauma patients remains unclear. The goal of our present study is to assess the predictive value of the above four parameters in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) as opposed to patients suffering from injuries not related to the brain. Material(s) and Method(s): 724 adult patients with an injury severity score (ISS) >16 were enrolled, excluding all burn patients, secondary referrals at any time point and patients receiving comfort therapy only. The patient collective was divided into trauma patients without TBI (group 1, NTBI), patients with isolated TBI (group 2), and patients with a combination of TBI and non-TBI injuries (group 3). Result(s): The mean age of all patients (77% male) was 40 years at a mean ISS of 32 (16-75). Mortality ranged from 13% (group 1) to 24% (group 3). Admission and serial lactate/BE values were higher in non-survivors in groups 1 and 3 (all p < 0.01), but not in group 2. Sub-sequently septic patients had higher lactate and BE levels >4 h after admission except for patients with isolated TBI, in whom no dis-tinction could be made. Admission SOFA-scores were higher in non-survivors in all groups (p < 0.023); in subsequently septic patients, a distinction between septic and non-septic patients was only possible in groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.005). Stepwise logistic regression and ROC-curve analysis revealed SOFA-score as best predictor for death irre-spective of the leading injury. Lactate and BE showed good predictive value in patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock (mainly group 1), whereas in patients with isolated TBI, initial GCS remained the most powerful predictor of mortality. Conclusion(s): Scores based on a range of physiologic data such as the SOF A-Score shows superior performance in predicting outcome in trauma patients suffering from injuries other than isolated TBI com-pared to single parameters such as lactate or BE. The observed differences are greatest in patients with prof ound physiologic derangements following excessive bleeding.

Prolonged arterial lactate elevation predicts a poor neurological outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Sawamoto K.; Maekawa K.; Miyata K.; Uemura S.; Tanno K.; Mori K.; Asai Y. ,"Introduction: The mortality and neurological morbidity associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is exceptionally high. Early and simple estimation of prognosis for the patient with severe TBI is an important factor in making treatment decisions and communicating with family. Hypothesis: The prolonged arterial lactate (LAC) elevation within 48 hours after admission predicts poor neurological outcome in patients with severe TBI. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study evaluated consecutive adult patients (ages 16-80 years) with severe TBI during a 6-year period (2005-2010). Patients with a GCS score= > 8 and < 8 but with significant abnormalities on CT scan (obliterated basal cisterns, contusions > 5 cm in diameter, and hematoma requiring evacuation), who later deteriorated, were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were cardiac arrest at the scene and death within 48 hours after admission. Data abstracted include age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupil reactivity, injury severity score (ISS), probability of survival (PS) calculated by TRISS methods, introduction of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), and LAC. LAC data were obtained on admission (T0) and 3 (T3), 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 24 (T24), and 48 hours (T48) after admission respectively. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between their 'poor' neurological outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]: severe disability, vegetative state or death) 6 months after admission and LAC variables. Result(s): Of 57 eligible patients, 24 (42.1%) were 'good' neurological outcome. In univariate analysis we found statistically differences in PS and LAC on T3, T6, T12, T24 and T48. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, LAC on T6, T12, T24 and T48 were statistically significant predictors of 'poor' outcome, and theirs adjusted odds ratio for LAC+ 0.1 mmol/L were 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = .02) on T6, 1.08 (95% CI 1.01-1.15, p= .01) on T12, 1.11 (95% CI 1.02-1.20, p= .02) on T24 and 1.28 (95% CI 1.06-1.56, p = .01) on T48, respectively.

Most studies used the Glasgow Outcome Score at 6 months post-injury as outcome measure, sometimes in combination with other outcome measures. Strong evidence for predicting outcome at six months was found for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), GCS admission, motor score, midline shift on CT scan, subdural haematoma and pulsatility index. Strong evidence of no association was found for gender and intraventricular haemorrhage. For other determinants, inconclusive or no evidence was found.

Outcome of geriatric patients with severe Brain Trauma who have glasgow coma scale scores <5,Brazinova A.; Mauritz W.; Rusnak M.; Majdan M. ,"Objectives: Geriatric patients with severe traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are considered to have an almost hopeless prognosis. Patients aged >65 years, and those with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of <5 are excluded from most clinical studies. To the best of our knowledge this special group of patients has not been studied before. We therefore decided to investigate the outcomes of patients with severe TBI who had a GCS score <5 and were >65 years of age. Method(s): Between 01/2001 and 12/2005 13 European centers enrolled 1172 patients with severe TBI (GCS<9). Data sets of all patients aged >65 years who had GCS scores of 3 or 4 were analysed. According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (GOS) 12 months after trauma patients were classified as having ""favourable (GOS scores 5+4) or ""unfavourable (GOS scores 3-1) outcome, and relevant data for these two groups was compared. We did univariate analyses first (chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests), and used variables that showed differences as covariates in logistic regression models. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Of the 1172 patients in the database 100 (8.5%) had GCS scores of 4 or 3 and were aged >65 years. Of these 100 patients, 11 had a favourable outcome, and 89 had an unfavorable outcome. There were 29 female, and 71 male patients. Factors that were significantly associated with favourable outcome were gender ""female (21% of the female, but only 7% of the male patients had favourable outcome), trauma severity mean (median Abbreviated Injury Score [AIS] ""head 4 vs. 5), ""open or ""partially open basal cisterns on first CT scan, and ""no midline shift on first CT scan. Factors that were significantly associated with unfavourable outcome were gender ""male, higher trauma severity, and ""closed basal cisterns on the first CT scan (this last factor was associated with 100% mortality). Mean age was slightly higher in the group with unfavourable outcome (74.8 vs. 73.6 yrs) but this was not significant. There was only one survivor >82 years old and no >88years old. No other CT features (e.g. subdural or intraventricular hematoma), and none of the treatment factors (e.g. prehospital treatment, direct transfer, neurosurgery, intracranial pressure monitoring) were associated with outcomes. Conclusion(s): In general, geriatric patients with severe TBI and low GCS scores have a poor prognosis.

Utility of diffusion tensor imaging in the acute stage of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury for detecting white matter lesions and predicting long-term cognitive function in adults: Clinical article,Matsushita M.; Hosoda K.; Naitoh Y.; Yamashita H.; Kohmura E. ,"Object. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often impairs cognitive function. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging, a novel modality, permits evaluation of the effects of head trauma on white matter nerve fibers. The objectives of the current study were to investigate where the white matter injury following mild to moderate TBI is specifically located on DT imaging in the acute disease stage and to examine the relationship between the severity of the white matter lesion on DT imaging in the acute stage of TBI and future cognitive function in the chronic disease stage. Methods. Twenty adult patients with mild to moderate TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score between 9 and 15) underwent conventional MR and DT imaging a median of 3.5 days after injury, and 27 matched healthy controls also underwent both imaging modalities. The patients with TBI were further subdivided into 2 groups, that is, mild and more severe TBI groups, based on clinical (mild or moderate TBI), CT (diffuse brain injury [DBI] I or II), or MR imaging (normal or pathological appearance) classification. Fractional anisotropies (FAs) were compared between patients and controls using the region of interest method. Regions of interest were located in 8 different areas including the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiata (CR), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), frontal white matter (FWM), and occipital white matter (OWM) of the periventricular white matter. Eleven patients with TBI also underwent neuropsychological testing, which included the Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and P300 testing in the chronic disease stage (median 364 days). Results. Region of interest analysis demonstrated significantly lower FA values in the genu, stem, and splenium of the corpus callosum in more severe TBI groups (moderate TBI on clinical classification, DBI II on CT classification, and pathological appearance on MR imaging classification) than in controls. A significant difference was also observed in the FA of the splenium between controls and the mild TBI group of the clinical classification. No significant difference was observed in the FA of the CR, ALIC, PLIC, FWM, and OWM between controls and any of the TBI groups of clinical or imaging classifications. No significant difference was observed in the FA of any regions between mild and more severe TBI groups of the clinical or imaging classifications. Multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant positive linear relationship between FA in the splenium and total IQ (r = 0.79, p = 0.004). A significant negative linear relationship between FA in the FWM and P300 latency was also observed (r = 0.62, p = 0.04). Conclusions.

The authors aimed to further investigate neurological outcome among head injury patients by examining the prognostic values of CT patterns of traumatic SAH, in particular, the thickness and distribution. Methods. The study was conducted using a database in a regional trauma center in Hong Kong. Data had been prospectively collected in consecutive trauma patients between January 2006 and December 2008. Patients included in the study had significant head injury (as defined by a head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score of 2 or more) with traumatic SAH according to admission CT. Results. Over the 36-month period, 661 patients with significant head injury were admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Two hundred fourteen patients (32%) had traumatic SAH on admission CT. The mortality rate was significantly greater and a 6-month unfavorable outcome was significantly more frequent in patients with traumatic SAH. Multivariate analysis showed that the maximum thickness (mm) of traumatic SAH was independently associated with neurological outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) and death (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) but not with the extent or location of hemorrhage. Conclusions. Maximum thickness of traumatic SAH was a strong independent prognostic factor for death and clinical outcome.

Predicting TBI outcomes in the transforming research and clinical knowledge in traumatic brain injury (track-TBI) study,Dams-O'Connor K.; Kulubya E.; Gordon W.; Yue J.; Puccio A.; Okonkwo D.; Valadka A.; Manley G. ,"PURPOSE: The current study explores the utility of the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) in accounting for objective and subjective outcomes beyond the acute phase of injury. The GOS-E is one of the most widely used methods for quantifying overall outcome after head injury, yet its prognostic value in explaining post-acute outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. METHOD(S): A sample of 214 individuals with mild to severe TBI were recruited from Emergency Departments and inpatient brain injury rehabilitation units at four USA hospitals. Participants completed the GOS-E via telephone 3 months post-injury, and then completed a NIH/NINDS common data elements consensus-based battery of neurocognitive assessments 6 months post-injury. In addition to the GOS-E, participants completed a set of self-reported measures (Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI 18)), an objective measure of functional independence (Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique - Short Form (CHART-SF)), and a battery of administered, timed neurocognitive measures (California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), Processing Speed Index of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-IV (WAIS- IV), and the Trail Making Test (TMT)). RESULT(S): The GOS-E administered 3 months post-injury is not significantly associated with timed measures of neurocognitive function at 6-months post TBI in this cohort (F(1,165) = 0.16-2.7; p > .05). Cross-sectional analyses of data collected at 6-month follow up reveals that GOS-E is significantly correlated with self-report indices of functioning (i.e., RPQ, SWLS, BSI; p < .01) and select CHART-SF subscales, but is not associated with timed measures of neurocognitive function (i.e., TMT, WAIS-IV; p> .05). CONCLUSION(S): Cognitive impairment is a major cause of long-term disability after brain injury. The lack of association between GOS-E and common indices of neurocognitive functioning may limit the usefulness of the GOS-E, when used in isolation, as an predictor or indicator of TBI outcomes.",2011,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,28,6,A60,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.9945,70479853,#24216,Dams-O'Connor 2011,,yes
A risk prediction model for determining early mortality following traumatic brain injury,Park G.J.; Shin S.D.; Song K.J.; Kwak Y.H.; Park C.B. ,"We developed and validated practical prognostic models for short term mortality (death at day 1 and 3) after traumatic brain injury. We identified moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (GCS <= 13) patients aged over 18 years from a 7 ED based Traumatic Brain Injury Network (2008-2010). We excluded cases with unknown hospital outcomes. Candidate predictors were gender, age, pupil reflex, motor GCS, presence of shock (systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg), abnormal brain CT findings, and injury mechanism. Outcome was defined as early mortality at day 1 and 3. Multivariable logistic regression was used to select variables associated with mortality. We measured the area under the curve (AUC) to assess the performance of the model. Among a 2-year adult TBI patients of 52,160 cases, a total of 742 patients including severe (GCS <= 8, n = 373, 50.3%), and moderate (9 <= GCS <= 13, n = 369, 40.7%) TBI met inclusion criteria. The mortality at day 1 and 3 were 14.6% (n = 108) and 17.5% (n = 130), respectively. This model included 5 outcome predictors: age, pupil reactivity, motor GCS, shock, and the presence of brain CT lesion. The adjusted ORs of 1 day mortality were 3.17(no pupil reactivity, 95% CI 1.41-7.11), 1.67 (motor GCS, 95% CI 1.34-2.08), 9.11 (presence of shock, 95% CI 4.79-17.3), 2.12 (abnormal brain CT, 95% CI 0.72-6.21), respectively. The measured area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.95). The adjusted ORs of 3 day mortality were 1.58 (age, 95% CI 1.24-2.02), 1.55 (motor GCS, 95% CI 1.29-1.88), 3.52 (no pupil reactivity, 95% CI 1.7-7.31), 8.31 (shock, 95% CI 4.48-15.43), 3.37 (abnormal brain CT, 95% CI 1.179.76), respectively.

Predictive value of an early Glasgow Outcome Scale score for severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients,Jourdan C.; Bayen E.; Bosserelle V.; Azerad S.; Aegerter P.; Pradat-Diehl P.; Weiss J.-J.; Azouvi P. ,"Background.- Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) is a useful outcome scale for TBI patients. Its early assessment by neurologists predicts later disability, and evaluations at 1, 9 and 15 months post-TBI are highly correlated. This global disability evaluation is often used by critical care practitioners to assess prognosis for these patients. Objectives.- To study the validity of early GOS score assessed at the end of intensive care for later prognosis for severe TBI patients. It is part of a larger regional prospective inception cohort study assessing the care network and oneyear outcome after a severe TBI in the Parisian area (France), the PariS-TBI study. Methods.- All adult patients with severe TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less) in the Parisian area were recruited prospectively by mobile emergency services. Between July 2005 and April 2007, 504 patients were recruited, acute care mortality rate was 45%. GOS was assessed by critical care practitioners at discharge from intensive care and at one year by a trained neuropsychologist, for 119 patients of the cohort. Construct validity measure of early GOS used initial severity variables. Its predictive value used comparison and correlation measure with one-year GOS. Results.- Patients were male in 83%, mean age was 35.7+/-16.1, mean initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5.7+/-1.8. Early GOS score showed strong correlation with initial severity variables. Early and late evaluations ofGOSwere significantly correlated (P < 0.001), but correlation was poor, with a Spearman's coefficient of 0.33, and a weighted kappa statistic of 0.32 (95% confidence interval = [0.16-0.49]). One-year GOS was more favourable than early GOS for 39 (33%) patients, identical for 53 (45%) patients, and worse for 27 (23%) patients. Discussion.- This suggests that for several patients, early GOS evaluation underestimated real disabilities. Early assessment of disability by critical care practitioners is a poor predictor of outcome for severe TBI patients, and should not be used to inform patients or families on prognosis of TBI, or for decisions on post-acute care.",2011,/,Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,54,SUPPL. 1,e278,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rehab.2011.07.214,70538341,#24206,Jourdan 2011,,yes
The predictive value of the level of brain injury for coagulopathy in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury,Franschman G.; Peerdeman S.M.; Loer S.A.; Greuters S.; Boer C. ,"Background and Goal of Study: The presence of coagulopathy is strongly associated with mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its relation with the level of brain injury is only scarcely investigated. Here we investigated whether the severity of brain injury and coagulopathy in isolated TBI are related or should be considered as independent predictors for outcome. Material(s) and Method(s): The medical records of 226 CT-confirmed isolated TBI patients were retrospectively evaluated. Coagulopathy was defined as an activated partial thromboplastin time > 40 seconds and/or a prothrombin time >1.2 and/or a platelet count < 120*109/l. CT scans were assigned to a five-point scale according to the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) CT classification. Result(s): Patients were mostly male, aged 49 +/- 20 years with a median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9 (3-13). Coagulopathy occurred in 40% of patients in the first 24 hours post-trauma. The median TCDB CT classification was similar in patients with (2 (2-3)) or without (2.5 (2-5)) coagulopathy, and there were no differences in coagulation parameters among TCDB CT classifications. The CT classification was not predictive for the development of coagulopathy. CT classification (OR 1.51; P=0.03) and coagulopathy (OR 6.85; P=0.001) were independent prognostic factors for outcome in addition to age, GCS and pupil reflex. Discussion and Conclusion(s): The TCDB CT classification and the occurrence of coagulopathy in isolated TBI are poorly related and are of independent predictive value for outcome in TBI. These data support addition of coagulopathy as early prognostic marker in predictive models for outcome after brain injury.",2011,/,European Journal of Anaesthesiology,28,SUPPL. 48,191,,,70681582,#24192,Franschman 2011,,yes
Full outline of unresponsiveness score versus the glasgow coma scale as a predictor of outcome after traumatic brain injury: A prospective comparative study,Fayed A.; Okasha A.S.; Sabry A. ,"Introduction: The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) has been universally utilized as a common diagnostic tool to evaluate the level of consciousness and the prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score is a new coma Scale that was developed to overcome the limitations of the GCS. It has been validated in different clinical studies. Hypothesis: To determine whether FOUR score is an appropriate predictor of outcome in TBI patients and to compare its performance to GCS. Method(s): 60 adult TBI patients were enrolled. The initial FOUR score and GCS were assessed at the emergency Department after hemodynamic stabilization. Both scores were compared regarding Outcome parameters. Result(s): Under the unadjusted model, for every one point increase in the FOUR total score, there is an associated 38% reduction in the odds of in-hospital mortality. Similarly, for every one point increase in total GCS score, there is an associated 40% reduced odds of experiencing in-hospital mortality. In predicting in-hospital mortality, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 for the FOUR score and 0.80 for the GCS. The difference between Area under the Curve (AUC) of the two scores was statistically significant (p = 0.025). Considering the total FOUR score, for every one-point increase the score, there was an estimated 36% reduction in the odds of unfavorable outcome. Similarly, for every one-point increase in the total GCS, there is an estimated 39% reduced odds of experiencing unfavorable outcome under the unadjusted model. Both scores showed significant negative correlation with length of ICU stay (R = -0.54 [FOUR score] &-0.57 [GCS score]) and hospital stay (R = -0.51 [FOUR score] &-0.52 [GCS score]). In predicting need for intubation & MV, the AUC was 0.96 for the FOUR score and 0.97 for the GCS; no statistical difference between the two scores. Conclusion(s): Although both scores are accurate predictors of in-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury in this study, the FOUR score is superior to GCS. Both scores equally predict the GOSE at one month, need for intubation and MV as well as the length of ICU & hospital stay.",2011,/,Critical Care Medicine,39,SUPPL. 12,83,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000408627.24229.88,71058629,#24173,Fayed 2011,,yes
Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy in severe TBI patients,Cote N.; Turgeon A.F.; Lauzier F.; Moore L.; Simard J.-F.; Scales D.; Burns K.E.A.; Meade M.O.; Bernard F.; Zygun D.A.; Fergusson D.A. ,"Introduction: Mortality following Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains high and often follows withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (WLST). However, studies reporting the determinants of WLST in this population are scarce. We hypothesized that certain factors related to the injury and management strategies are associated with the decision to WLST in critically ill patients with severe TBI. We thus conducted a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter retrospective cohort study. Method(s): Mechanically ventilated patients aged 16 years and older admitted over a 2-year period in the intensive care unit (ICU) following severe TBI (GCS <= 8) were considered eligible. Patients were identified through health records using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes for TBI. 120 charts were randomly selected (720 total) among eligible patients in each of the 6 participating centers. Trained data abstractors collected data using a pretested and standardized case report form along with an operations manual to provide a homogenous data collection. Data on management strategies and on the progression of the patients' condition were collected from ER to the first 14 days of ICU stay. Data on surgical procedures, the use of diagnostic imaging, electrophysiological tests and the decision to WLST were also collected up to 28 days. The association of factors, pertaining to the injury and to management strategies, with death following WLST was evaluated using a multiple regression analysis approach among non-survivors (n=228). Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted; the final model included factors with a p<0.2 and 4 baseline variables (3 associated with prognosis: age, GCS motor score and pupillary reflex, and gender). A liberal p-value was used considering the number of variables evaluated. Research Ethic Board approval was obtained in all participating centers. Result(s): We analyzed 225 patients (3 missing data) including predominantly male patients (69.7%) with a mean age of 50.7 years. Among non-survivors, brain herniation on initial CT scan was more often reported in patients dying following WLST (OR 2.91, 95%CI 1.16-7.30, p=0.02), while the opposite was observed for epidural hematoma (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.06-0.56, p<0.01). Craniotomy (OR 0.12, 95%CI 0.02-0.68, p=0.02) and non neurosurgical procedures (OR 0.08, 95%CI 0.02-0.43, p<0.01) were associated with a lower odds of death following WLST. Management strategies such as the use of vasopressors (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.22-1.11, p=0.09), DVT prophylaxis (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-1.03, p=0.06) and insulin infusion (OR 2.13, 95%CI 0.99-4.62, p=0.06) were not significantly associated with lower and higher odds of death due to WLST. The use of intracranial pressure monitoring was not found to be associated with death following WLST in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Discussion(s): Death due to WLST was associated with several patient and clinical factors. We also observed that WLST was less frequent among patients that had received more aggressive treatments, for example craniotomy.

Prognostic value of clinical variables in moderate and severe head injury,Ercegovic Z.; Moranjkic M.; Brkic H.; Hodzic M. ,"Introduction: Craniocerebral injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among predominantly young population. Outcome prediction after head injury can be useful as an aid to clinical decision making, to explore possible pathological mechanisms and as part of the clinical audit process. Many studies have constructed predictive models for survival after traumatic brain injury, but these have often used expensive, time consuming or highly specialized measurements. The aim of this study was to develop a simple, yet easy to use, model involving only variables which are rapidly and easily clinically achievable in routine practice. Patients and Methods: All consecutive patients older than 14 years with moderate or severe isolated head injury admitted to our department in period between 01.01.2007. and 30.06.2008. were enrolled in the study. Basic demographic and clinical data (Glasgow coma score, pupil size and reactivity, revised trauma score) were recorded. Outcome at 1 and 3 months after injury graded by GOS was used to construct a simple predictive model. Result(s): We analyzed records 82 patients with moderate or severe head injury according to GCS. Multiple logistic regression resulted in a model containing age (p=0.0001), GCS (p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure of the RTS (p < 0.0001; t=7.388) and pupil reactivity (p < 0.0001; t=-5.605) at admission as fair independent outcome predictors, with motor component of the GCS scale exhibiting greater predictive value over the entire GCS score (p < 0.0001; t=5.732). Conclusion(s): All four variables have previously been shown to be related to survival. All variables in the model are clinically simple and easy to measure rapidly resulting in a model that is clinically useful.

Bilirubin and uric acid in traumatic brain injury,Adiga U.S.; Vickneshwaran V.; Sen S.K.; Thiagaragan G. ,"Background and Objectives: Oxidative stress is the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants. Uric acid and bilirubin, end products of purine ahd heme metabolism are important antioxidants in the serum, paradoxically act as pro-oxidants. Their role is controversial and to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies about uric acid and bilirubin levels in traumatic brain injury patients. Aim of our study is to estimate the levels of uric acid and bilirubin in TBI and correlate with the severity of the injury. Method(s): Uric acid and bilirubin were estimated in 26 TBI patients in the age group of 36 +/-7 yrs, admitted to P.I.M.S hospital within 24 hrs of injury and 27 age & sex matched healthy controls. Clinical assessment of the severity of the injury was done by Glasgow coma scale, blood pressure and CT findings. Results were analysed by unpaired 't' test and pearson's correlation coefficient.P<0.05 was considered to be significant. Result(s): Uric acid levels in patients and controls are 5.79 +/- 1.32 and 4.2 +/- 1.17 mg/dl respectively and total bilirubin levels being 1.03+/-0.6 and 0.71 +/- 0.18 mg/dl respectively. P values being highly significant for both the parameters(P<0.0001 for uric acid and P<0.01 for bilirubin). Uric acid and GCS were also positively correlated(r=0.041). Conclusion(s): We conclude that bilirubin and uric acid are beneficial in TBI patients as they are potent antioxidants. Since these parameters were high in patients with high GCS, fwe arrived at the conclusion that they can be used as markers of prognostification of TBI.

The age, gender, causes of HI, basic neurologic examination findings, radiologic findings and discharge status are examined. Result(s): Most of the data were simplified as absent (0) and present (1), and mortality rates for each groups were accepted weighted values. All data were processed statistically and two models were created. Model 1 with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score predicted the mortality/vegetative event at a rate of 56.5%, and the conscious survival event at 98.7%. Model 2, without the GCS score, predicted the mortality/vegetative event at 55.1% rate and the conscious survival event at 99.2%.

Impact of age and anticoagulation: Need for neurosurgical intervention in trauma patients with mild traumatic brain injury,Moore M.M.; Pasquale M.D.; Badellino M. ,"BACKGROUND: Of the 500,000 brain injuries in the United States annually, 80% are considered mild (mild traumatic brain injury). Unfortunately, 2% to 3% of them will subsequently deteriorate and result in severe neurologic dysfunction. Intracerebral changes in the elderly, chronic oral anticoagulation, and platelet inhibition may contribute to the development of intracranial bleeding after minor head injury. We sought to investigate the association of age and the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy with neurologic deterioration and the need for neurosurgical intervention in patients presenting with mild traumatic brain injury. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of all adult (>14 years) patients admitted to our Level I trauma service with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14 to 15 who underwent neurosurgical intervention during their hospital stay was performed. Patients were stratified into two groups, age <65 years and age >>65 years. Each group was then further stratified by the use of anticoagulants: warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, or a combination. Mechanism of injury, prehospital complaints, admission GCS, type of neurosurgical intervention, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition were evaluated. Z test and logistic regression were used to compare proportions or percentages from different groups. RESULT(S): Of the 7,678 patients evaluated during the study period, 101 (1.3%) required neurosurgical intervention. The >>65 years population underwent significantly more interventions as did those patients on anticoagulants. CONCLUSION(S): All patients aged 65 years or older who present with a GCS score of >13 after head trauma should undergo a screening computed tomography of the head regardless of prehospital use of anticoagulation. Patients younger than 65 years can be selectively screened based on presenting complaints and mechanism of injury provided they are not on anticoagulation.

Materials and Methods 54 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) cases were reviewed (43 male and 11 female) between the ages of 18 to 75 (36.17+/-14.9 years) admitted between 01-01-2010 to 01-08-2010 retrospectively from medical record section and as per the data recorded for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Revised Trauma Scale (RTS) and CT- findings according to Marshall CT classification. Results Of the 54 patients aged above 18 years, 43 were male and 11 were female (range, 18 to 75 years; 36.17+/-14.9 years). The ratio of male to female was 3.9:1. Males were affected more due to their high risk behavior. Correlation test between GCS vs. Marshall CT classification with a mean GCS on admission of 9.57+/-3.92 and mean CT score of 2.31+/-0.72 is significant at level of (p< 0.01) Similarly correlation test between RTS vs Marshall CT classification with mean RTS of 10.3+/-1.51 was significant at (p<0.01) Conclusions This study concludes that RTS and CT findings are highly correlated and have good consistency with each other. GCS included in framing 'Revised Trauma Scale' is more accurate for prognosis than when GCS is considered alone.",2012,/,Australasian Medical Journal,5,1,63,,,70678368,#24042,Madinur 2012,,yes
Acute predictors of functional outcome of senior patients with traumatic brain injury,Miyakoshi K.; Iai S.; Nasu T.; Kasai T.; Hadeishi H. ,"Objectives: Prediction of future functional ability is mandatory to plan an effective rehabilitation program and to provide the information about future disability of the patients. But it is far from easy to predict it with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases, because their symptoms and clinical courses are quite complicated.Meanwhile, as the geriatric population glows, present-day Japan suffers serious shortage of hospital or nursing home capacity. So prediction of future ability and life status of the patients is strongly required from earlier stage of patient care.The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of functional outcome and length of hospital stay (LOS) in patients with acute TBI of older adults in Japan. Method(s): Study participants were consecutive acute TBI patients who admitted to our hospital from June 2006 to May 2011. Our hospital is an 857-bed acute care community hospital accredited by Joint Commission International. All these patients received comprehensive medical care along with a combination of rehabilitative therapies, including physical, occupational and speech therapy accordingly.Included in this survey were the patient's aged 60 years old and older. The exclusion criteria were the patients without self-sustaining ADL before TBI, those without completion of our rehabilitation program due to hospital transfer, or those of inpatient death.We choose following predictive factors and outcome indicators from our medical records retrospectively. As prognostic factors, we selected patient's age, continued days of consciousness disturbance with Glasgow Coma Scale 2 or lower regarding eye-opening term, and CT findings showing presence of diffuse brain edema, intracerebral hematoma, midline shift, and or expansion of hematoma within 48 hours. As the outcome indicators, we adopted Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, version 3 Japanese edition and LOS.We distinguished significant predictive factors by stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Result(s): The participants were 84 patients (48 men and 36 women), the age was 60 to 93 years old (mean 76.6). LOS was 4 to 202 days (mean 47.0). FIM at discharge were 18 to 126 (mean 83.6).Significant predictive factors of FIM elucidated by multivariate regression analysis were patient's age and days of consciousness disturbance. Those standardized coefficients were -0.365, -0.227, respectively. As for LOS, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated days of consciousness disturbance as the sole significant predictive factor. Conclusion(s): Patient's age and days of consciousness disturbance were significant predictive factors for functional outcome in patients with TBI. Among those predictive factors, patient's age had the highest impact on the outcome. And period of consciousness disturbance was picked up as a significant predictive factor of LOS.Now we intend to develop a simple prediction model of future patient's status by subsequent prospective study.",2012,/,Brain Injury,26,05-Apr,449-450,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.660091,70731687,#24028,Miyakoshi 2012,,yes
Serum levels of S100B from jugular bulb as a biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with severe acute brain injury,Ballesteros M.A.; Rubio-Lopez M.I.; Padilla A.M.L.; Martin M.S.; Lopez-Hoyos M.; Minambres E. ,"Objective: To prospectively study the correlation between jugular bulb and systemic S100B levels in subjects treated for severe acute brain injury and to investigate the prognostic value of this biomarker in brain damaged patients. Method(s): Prospective clinical investigation in a 22-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in a University hospital. Subjects were admitted to the ICU by severe traumatic brain injury or spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with the following inclusion criteria: Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <=8, adults and admission<12 hours after injury. Blood samples for S100B (from jugular bulb and systemic catheter) were drawn simultaneously at admission and every 24 hours for three days. Outcome was evaluated as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months. We also evaluated the development of brain death. Correlations between S100B determinations were studied using Pearson correlation. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluated predective marker. Result(s): 86 subjects (51.6+/-18.3 years) were included. 26 (31.3%) were female and the median GCS was 6. None of the patients suffered extracraneal lesions. The first blood sample was drawn at 5.4+/-3.3 hours after injury. Jugular s100B levels were significantly higher than systemic levels at admission (mean difference: 0.15 mg/L; 95%CI:0.02-0.28), at 24 hours (mean difference 0.07 mg/L; 95%CI:0.02-0.12), and at 72 hours (mean difference 0.03 mg/L; 95%CI:0.01-0.05). A correlation was found between the jugular and systemic S100B at admission (r=0.79; p=0.001), at 24 hours (r=0.979 p=0.001), at 48 hours (r=0.720; p=0.001) and at 72 hours (r=0.941; p=0.001). Systemic S100B levels at 24 hours after injury had an AUC of 0.682 (95%CI:0.528-0.836; p=0.063) for unfavourable prognosis (GOS 1-3) which was similar to jugular S100B levels (AUC 0.686, 95%CI:0.535-0.837; p=0.059). ROC curve analysis of jugular S100B levels to brain death displayed a good correlation at admission (AUC 0.667; 95%CI:0.530-0.804; p=0.022) and at 48 hours after injury (AUC 0.733; 95% CI: 0.575- 0.891; p=0.009). Similar results were observed with systemic S100B levels at admission (AUC 0.654; 95%CI:0.516-0.792; p=0.042) and at 48 hours (AUC 0.731; 95%CI:0.580-0.882; p=0.008). Conclusion(s): The jugular S100B levels correlate well with the systemic levels. The measurement of jugular level of this protein might be useful.

Consciousness recovery after severe traumatic brain injury: Neuromediator and neuroanatomical correlates,Alexandrova E.; Zaitsev O.; Tenedieva V.; Vorobiev Y.; Sychev A.; Sokolova E.; Zakharova N.; Gavrilov A.; Okhlopkov V.; Kravchuk A.; Potapov A. ,"Objectives: to reveal correlations between consciousness, neurological recovery and dynamics of plasma catecholamine (CA) levels taking into account: 1) the damage of bilateral frontal lobe, subcortical structures and brainstem and 2) the damage of norepinephrinergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic neuromediator brainstem structure. Method(s): This study included 58 patients with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (sTBI, GCS<8) (38 male and 20 female) aged 16-72 (30,1+/-10,9 y.o.). Plasma CA (Norepinephrine-NE, Dopamine-DA, Epinephrine-E) levels were evaluated in dynamics by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector. Consciousness levels ranged based on the following criteria: eye opening only +/- tracking (stage 1), obeying commands +/- attempts to speak (stage 2), answering questions +/- orientation (stage 3). Neurological state included evaluation of preferentially cholinergic (paresis with muslular hypotony, hyporeflexia) and dopaminergic (paresis with muslular hypertony, trism, tremor) deficiency sings. Brain damage localization was verified by 3T MRI (T1, T2, FLAIR, T2 GRE, SWI, DWI) in all patients. Result(s): Two variants of CA dynamics were found during consciousness recovery: 1) CA-dissociation, when NE and DA level changes were oppositely directed, was observed in unconsciousness (stage 1); 2) CA-association - unidirectional NE and DA level changes followed by the unconsciousness regress (stages 2-3). In patients with two frontal lobe and brainstem damage CA-dissociation periods were observed on the stage 3. DA level increased in patients with two frontal lobe damage (p<0,05) and decreased in patients without two frontal lobe damage (p<0,05) before achieving the 3 rd stage. Clinical data and CA-association/dissociation were analyzed depending of the traumatic injury of different brainstem neuromediator anatomical structures: norepinephrinergic (locus coeruleus area), dopaminergic (ventral tegmental area, substantia negra) and cholinergic (laterodorsal tegmental area, pedunculopontine tegmental area). Conclusion(s): Posttraumatic unconscious state is a clinical manifestation of disconnection between brainstem, subcortical structures and cortex, mainly its frontal lobes. Our findings support the idea of frontal lobes involving in modulation of the sympathetic nervous system activity, the main NE and DA source in plasma. NE and DA dynamics seems to reflect brain recovery and is considered an important prognostic marker of sTBI course. The association between brainstem neuromediator structure damage and clinical features was analyzed.

Hypopituitarism in adults in the long-term perspective after severe traumatic brain injury: Relationship to outcome,Ulfarsson T.; Gudnason G.; Rosen T.; Lundgren-Nilsson A.; Nilsson M. ,"Objectives: Over the last years, increasing evidence has suggested that posttraumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) is a common complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (1). This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between pituitary function and outcome in adults in the long-term perspective after a severe TBI. Method(s): 51 patients aged 16-65 years who were admitted to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, from January 1st 1999 to December 31st 2002 with a Glasgow Coma Scale<9 participated in the study. Each patient was assessed at one time point 2-10 years post-trauma. Hormonal testing and clinical examination were performed. Outcome measures included the Short Form-36 Health Survey, the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended and a self-report questionnaire using the framework of the ICF classification. The predictive value of some of the clinical parameters and CT-findings in the acute settings was combined into the CRASH prognostic model of TBI. Result(s): Overall, 14 out of 51 patients (27.5%) presented with PTHP. All the patients had isolated deficiencies. Eleven of fifty-one patients (21.6%) were growth hormone deficient (GHD). Two out of fifty-one patients (3.9%) had gonadotrophic deficiency (both men) and one man of the fifty-one patients (2%) had a thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency. No significant correlation was found between PTHP and self-reported quality of life and functional outcome. Older patients at the time of injury were more likely to have growth hormone deficiency (GHD) at follow up (95% CI of the difference=8.5 - 28.0). The patients with a GHD had a higher BMI (95% CI of the difference=0.7-4.0) and were more often overweight (p=0.02) at the time of injury compared to the controls. However the results did not show a difference in weight gaining post-trauma between the groups. Conclusion(s): By relating outcome to PTHP, age, gender, BMI and injury severity in a relatively homogenous group of patients with a severe TBI we did not confirm results from other studies showing that PTHP is related to outcome in TBI.",2012,/,Brain Injury,26,05-Apr,691-692,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.660091,70732108,#24021,Ulfarsson 2012,,yes
Feasibility of a multicenter prospective cohort study on the evaluation of prognosis in severe traumatic brain injury,Turgeon A.F.; Lauzier F.; Thibodeau M.; Rigamonti A.; Meade M.; Bernard F.; Burns K.; Reddy K.; Scales D.; McIntyre L.; Green R.; Griesdale D.; Moore L.; Savard M.; Jichici D.; Paquet J.; Zygun D.; Fergusson D. ,"Introduction: Conducting prospective research in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is challenging. To prepare for a large-scale multicenter study to evaluate long-term prognosis in severe TBI, we conducted a prospective pilot study evaluating the patterns of enrollment, the compliance to the schedule of prognostic tests and the completeness of follow-up for 6-month functional outcome measures. Methods We conducted a pilot study in nine level I trauma centers in Canada. Adult patients with severe TBI expected to require mechanical ventilation for >=48 hours were enrolled on their first day in the ICU. Prognostic tests were performed on arrival (CT scan), day 1 (serum biomarker), day 3 (serum biomarker, CT scan) and day 7 (serum biomarker, CT scan, MRI, SSEP, EEG) with time windows of 24 or 48 hours depending on the test. Prognostic measures were collected during the first week in the ICU to examine the association with the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score. We considered as appropriate a compliance to the schedule of prognostic tests >=90% and a proportion of lost to follow-up <10%. We obtained REB approval from participating centers and written informed consent from SDMs. Results Among 116 consecutive eligible patients, 50 were enrolled over a total of 204 weeks of screening between May 2010 and May 2011. Two centers used a deferred consent approach. Patients were primarily male with a median age of 45 years and a GCS of 5 (25th to 75th: 3 to 7). The two main reasons for nonenrollment were the time window for inclusion being after regular working hours (35%, n = 23) and oversight (24%, n = 16). The compliance to the different tests ranged from 93 (three missing tests) to 100%. All blood samples but one (day 7) were performed. The main reason for missing a test was the patient's instability (hemodynamic or increased ICP) (n = 5). In six patients, the MRI had to be delayed due to the presence of material not compatible with the procedure. No patient was lost to follow-up at 6 months. Conclusion These results demonstrate the feasibility of enrollment and complying to a structured protocol of prognostic tests in a prospective multicenter study in severe TBI patients.",2012,/,Critical Care,16,SUPPL. 1,S112,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc10917,70735250,#24019,Turgeon 2012,,yes
UCH-L1 and MAP-2 biomarkers improve 6-month functional outcome prediction in severe traumatic brain injury,Heaton S.C.; Hannay H.J.; Papa L.; Tyner C.; Hayes R.; Robertson C.; Schmalfuss I.; Wang K.K.W.; Robicsek S. ,"Introduction Identification of biomarkers predictive of mortality and functional outcome is important for clinical management of severe TBI. We examined whether acute levels of biomarkers UCH-L1 or MAP-2, in combination with patient demographic characteristics and acute injury variables, could predict a range of functional outcomes six months post-injury. Methods Data was obtained from adult severe closed head injury patients presenting to two Level I Trauma Centers. Patients had a GCS score < 8 and required intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Ventricular CSF was sampled within 24 hours of injury and analyzed for biomarkers using ELISA. Biomarker levels were measured in ng/ml. Two stepwise hierarchical linear regressions were constructed to model functional outcome prediction including either UCH-L1 or MAP-2. Both models evaluated predictive contributions of 3 demographic variables (age, pre-injury occupational status, educational attainment) and 4 acute injury variables (post-resuscitation GCS motor and pupillary response, Rotterdam score, ISS), in conjunction with either the UCH-L1 or MAP-2 biomarker level. Both models predicted 6 month outcome measured by the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), which quantifies functioning across 4 domains and yields a total score between 0 (no disability) and 29 (maximal disability), with 30 to indicate deceased. Results There were a total of 131 patients enrolled in the broader multi-site prospective study. Patients had a mean age of 38 years and 78% were male. As expected given the injury severity enrollment criteria, 68% had CT Marshall Classification of Diffuse Injury I-IV and 32% had Mass lesions. At 6 months post-injury, 104 patients had available follow-up outcome data. Of these, 84 patients had CSF collected for biomarker analysis within 24 hours of injury. Thirty (33%) patients did not survive to 6 months and were assigned a DRS score of 30. The remaining 54 surviving patients had a mean DRS score of 6.7 at the 6 month post-injury time point, with scores ranging from 0 (no disability) to 28 (extreme vegetative state) and a group median value of 4 (moderate disability). Both of the predictive models were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and accounted for 54% of the variance in DRS scores at 6 months post-injury. Surprisingly, pre-injury educational attainment, post-resuscitative GCS motor score, post-resuscitative pupillary response, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) did not contribute to either predictive model. The stepwise hierarchical regression which included UCH-L1 yielded a model comprised of the following variables in order of the outcome variance they explained: pre-injury occupational status (R2 change = 0.255), Rotterdam Score (R2 change = 0.166), age (R2 change = 0.109), and UCH-L1 (R2 change = 0.039). The regression model which included MAP-2 yielded a very similar model, with only slightly different levels of variance explained by the predictive variables: pre-injury occupational status (R2 change = 0.247), Rotterdam score (R2 change = 0.159), age (R2 change = 0.110), and MAP-2 (R2 change = 0.028). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the inclusion of UCH-L1 or MAP-2 biomarkers drawn within 24 hours of severe TBI can help to predict broad functional outcome of patients 6 months post-injury. This is an important contribution to previous findings that indicate these biomarkers may aid prediction of mortality or more basic dichotomous (good/bad) outcomes after TBI. Using a model comprised of patient demographic characteristics, acute injury variables, and either UCH-L1 or MAP-2 successfully predicted over half (54%) of the functional outcome variance in the current TBI sample. Somewhat surprisingly, some of the acute injury variables traditionally included in outcome prediction models (i.e., GCS motor score, pupillary response, and ISS) did not contribute to the prognostic model. Conversely, patient's pre-injury occupational status accounted for the largest amount (25%) of variance in 6 month functional outcome, highlighting the importance of considering pre-injury functioning when making functional outcome predictions. Future studies are needed to explore the prognostic value of similar models in predicting functional outcome specifically among survivors. Additional studies should also explore the optimal combination of specific predictors and functional outcome measures to provide the most useful information regarding individual patient prognosis after severe TBI.",2012,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,29,10,A42-A43,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.9943,70837473,#24007,Heaton 2012,,yes

Methods A prospective observational study design that enrolled adults with severe TBI presenting to two Level I trauma centers (Gainesville, FL and Houston, TX). Patients were included following blunt head injury with a GCS score of 8 or less and required a ventriculostomy. Ventricular CSF was sampled from each patient within 24 hours of injury and analyzed for candidate biomarkers using ELISA. Biomarker levels were measured in ng/ml. The IMPACT score (www.tbi-impact .org) was calculated for each patient to determine risk of mortality at 6 months.

Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to determine if the Marshall and/or Rotterdam added prognostic value to the Core IMPACT score. Results There were 131 patients enrolled in the study. Mean age of patients was 38 years and 78 were male. At 6 months 104 patients had followup data and 36 (35) did not survive to 6 months.

S100B as a prognostic biomarker in outcome prediction for patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Goyal A.; Niyonkuru C.; Carter M.; Amin K.; Fabio A.; Berger R. ,"Introduction Studies suggest that extra-cerebral contributions reduce the sensitivity of serum S100b for outcome prediction after TBI. We assessed longitudinal serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adults with severe TBI to characterize contributing extra-cerebral sources of S100b to serum and identify the most sensitive S100b estimate for outcome prognostication. Methods This study evaluates S100b as a prognostic biomarker in adults with severe TBI (GCS <= 8) by comparing outcomes with S100b temporal profiles generated from both CSF (n = 138 subjects; n = 499 samples) and serum (n = 80 subjects; n = 224 samples) across the first 6d postinjury. S100b was measured using Nexus Dx S100b enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Group based trajectory analysis (TRAJ) was used to generate subpopulations having unique temporal biomarker profiles. Long-bone fracture, injury severity score (ISS) derived from Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS) to anatomical regions, and isolated TBI status were used to assess extra-cerebral sources of serum S100b. Isolated TBI included head AIS >= 3 and AIS <3 for other anatomic regions. Non-isolated TBI included head AIS >=3 and AIS score >=3 for > 1 other anatomic region. Acute mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores were assessed 6 months post-TBI. Serum and CSF from healthy controls was used to assess injury-induced changes in S100b levels. Results CSF and serum S100b levels in TBI subjects were significantly increased over healthy control values across the first six days post- TBI of sampling (p<= 0.005 and p <= 0.031, respectively). There was strong correlation between CSF and serum levels across early time points post-TBI, but this association diminished over time. Bivariate analysis showed that CSF TRAJ group membership with higher S100b concentration was linked to unfavorable outcomes, including higher acute care mortality (p < 0.001), worse 6-month GOS scores (p = 0.002), and worse 6-month DRS scores (p = 0.005). Mean and peak CSF levels were less predictive of outcome and TRAJ group membership. Temporal serum profiles were strong predictors of acute mortality (p = 0.001) in bivariate analysis. Peak serum S100b levels showed further evidence toward discriminating morality status (p = 0.001). Evidence of significant extra-cerebral sources of serum S100b was represented best by ISS scores compared to other measures (e.g. fracture, isolated head injury status), where higher scores were associated with TRAJ group membership having higher serum S100b levels (p = 0.034). Membership in TRAJ groups having higher CSF S100b levels were observed for women (p = 0.021) and older subjects (p = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for demographic and injury covariates confirmed CSF S100b TRAJ as a strong predictor of GOS (p = 0.011) and DRS (p = 0.094) following severe TBI, while multivariate analysis confirmed serum S100b TRAJ as predictive of acute mortality (p = 0.016). Conclusions We demonstrate that S100b in CSF is a strong predictor of outcomes like acute care mortality, GOS, and DRS. Temporal serum S100b profiles were also strong in their predictive ability, despite extracerebral sources that could potentially confound estimates of S100b derived from cerebral sources. However, CSF-serum S100b correlation were strongest early after injury, and peak serum levels which typically occur early after TBI, were predictive of outcome. Future studies may confirm the relationship between CSF and serum S100b levels and should also focus on the prognostic value of early (e.g. admission) serum values when cerebrally-derived S100b is highest.",2012,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,29,10,A193-A194,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.9943,70837740,#24003,Goyal 2012,,yes
Incidence and impact of intensive care unit complications on moderate-severe traumatic brain injury-early results of the outcome prognostication in traumatic brain injury (Optimism) study,Muehlschlegel S.; Carandang R.; Ouillette C.; Hall W.; Anderson F.; Goldberg R. ,"Introduction: Certain admission characteristics are known predictors of adverse outcomes in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) patients, but explain only 1/3 of outcome variability. Retrospective studies suggest that non-neurologic organ failure may contribute to 2/3 of all deaths after msTBI, but actual incidence rates of intensive care unit (ICU) complications and their impact on outcome are not known. We examined the incidence rates of pre-specified medical and neurological ICU complications, and their impact on in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at hospital discharge. Method(s): In a prospective observational study, 183 consecutive msTBI patients from a single Level I trauma center between 11/2009-5/2012 were analyzed. Poor outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 1-3.Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to adjust for admission characteristics and ICU length-of-stay. Result(s): The mean age was 51 years, 71% were men, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale and Injury Severity Scores were 4 and 29, respectively. The five most common medical ICU complications were: hyperglycemia (77%), fever (62%), hypotension requiring vasopressors (40%), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (38%), anemia requiring transfusion (32%). Neurological ICU complications were: intracranial pressure crisis (ICP; [51% of n=72 with ICP monitor in place]), brain edema (38%), herniation (38%), intracranial rebleed (36%), clinical seizure (12%). Among medical complications, hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1-6.9]) while cardiac complications (e.g. cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction) were associated with death (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.8-20.6). When combining medical with neurological ICU complications, brain edema (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.5-18) was associated with poor outcome, while cardiac complications and brain edema were associated with death (OR 6.9; 95% CI 1.5-31.6 and OR 11.3; 95% CI 3-43, respectively). Conclusion(s): ICU complications are very common after msTBI. We identified specific potentially modifiable predictors of adverse outcomes after msTBI.

Can laboratory values and vital parameters help to determine short term prognosis in adult traumatic brain injury patients?,Bodhit A.; Patel P.; Daneshvar Y.; Hatchitt K.; Kuchibhotla S.; Pulvino C.; Mazzuoccolol A.; Elie M.-C.; Tyndall J.A.; Gabrielli A.; Stead L. ,"Introduction: To study the potential usefulness of initial vital parameters and laboratory evaluations to predict short term prognostic outcomes in adult (>=18 years ) traumatic brain injury patients. Method(s): This is an observational cohort study of all adult patients who came to the emergency department(ED) of a tertiary care hospital, in a 20 month period during 2008-2010. For the purpose of analysis, we considered initial vitals and lab values available for all patients. We individually compared vitals (pulse and mean arterial pressure-MAP) and laboratory values [Sodium(Na+), Potassium(K+), Bicarbonate(HCO3 -), glucose, WBC, RBC, Platelets, INR) for the following prognostic variables: abnormal head CT finding(yes/no), hospital admission (yes/no), ICU admission, in- hospital death, hospital length of stay(HLOS), and 3-month mortality using t-tests and correlations. The significant variables were then entered into a logistic regression model (for categorical variables) and a multiple regression model (for continuous variables) simultaneously to determine significant predictors of prognostic outcomes. Significance level was set at p=0.05. Result(s): Increase in glucose(p=0.004) and WBC(p<0.001) lead to a higher likelihood of having an abnormal head CT, when controlling for MAP and HCO3 - ; Increase in glucose (p=0.001) and WBC (p=0.02), and decrease in HCO3 -(p=0.009) and platelets(p=0.006) increases the likelihood of getting admitted, when controlling for MAP, K+, and RBC; Increased glucose(p<0.001), decreased HCO3 - (p=0.01) and decreased platelets(p=0.03) increases chances of in- hospital death, when controlling for WBC and INR; increased glucose(p=0.004), increased WBC(p<0.001), and decrease in RBC(p=0.005) increases HLOS, while controlling for pulse, K+, and HCO3 -.

Longitudinal follow-up of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients: What are the evolution patterns between one and four years post-TBI?,Jourdan C.; Darnoux E.; Bosserelle V.; Azerad S.; Bayen E.; Pradat-diehl P.; Weiss J.J.; Aegerter P.; Azouvi P. ,"Objectives.- To describe and explain cognitive and professional outcomes at one and four years post-TBI, through a comparative prospective observational study. Methods.- This study is part of a multicentre inception cohort study of severe TBI adult patients (initial Glasgow Coma Scale score +/- 8) in the Parisian area, the Paris-TBI study. Patients were consecutively recruited by mobile emergency services between 2005 and 2007. Patients were evaluated one year and four years post-injury by trained neuropsychologists. Evaluations addressed trauma severity and socio-demographic characteristics, global disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOSE]), cognitive deficiencies (Dysexecutive questionnaire [DEX]), and return to work [1,2]. Results.- Among 504 patients and 250 one-year survivors, 91 had both evaluations. Mean age was 33 +/- 14 years, 80% were men. DEX total scores showed a non-significant decrease, and the most frequent behavioural impairments were similar. Global disability on the GOSE had improved, but 13% of the sample had a worse late GOSE score. Employment rates were similar (39% at one year, 40% at four years), but only 26% of the sample had a stable employment at both evaluations, while 11% had lost their activity from one to four years, and 10% had gained a professional activity. More than half of the sample described various professional difficulties related to cognitive sequelae. Several prognostic factors associated with return to work and with employment stability were described.

The role of plasma D dimer as a prognostic marker in traumatic brain injury,El Reweny E.M.; Abo Khabar H.; Mourad S. ,"INTRODUCTION. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability around the globe. It is the leading cause of death among people less than 24 years of age. Serum S-100B, which is a calcium binding protein, is an attractive marker of primary and secondary brain insults. Coagulopathy is common in TBI with unique features; as the injured brain release tissue factor which triggers coagulopathy and hyperfibrinolysis marked by high levels of plasma D-dimmer. There has been a clear relationship found between high levels of plasma D-dimmer and poor outcome among patients suffered from traumatic brain injuries. OBJECTIVES. The aim of the study was to investigate the value of D-dimmer as a prognostic marker of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and compare it with serum S-100B. RESULTS. The study was conducted at Alexandria University Hospitals on 50 adult patients with isolated non surgical traumatic brain injury. The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee and informed consents were obtained. Patients were classified into favorable and unfavorable groups according to Glasgow outcome score (GOS) which was measured on day 14 or on either discharge or death of the patient. Blood samples for S-100B and D-dimmer were taken on admission, day 3 and day 14. D-dimmer mean values were 5,652.32 +/- 7,916.04, 4,529.0 +/- 5,353.54 and 1150.0 +/- - mu/L on admission, day 3 and day 14 respectively in the unfavorable group (those who had GOS of 1, 2, 3); which were significantly higher than the favorable group (those who had GOS of 4, 5);where the mean values of D-dimmer were 1,980.0 +/- 2,276.51, 1,073.45 +/- 810.86 and 455.45 +/- 347.99 mu/L on admission, day 3 and day 14 respectively. D-dimmer was found to have a cut off value of 1,540 mu/L; which had a sensitivity and specificity of 78.57 and 72.73 %, respectively and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 78.57 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 72.73 % with accuracy of 76.0 %. S-100B mean values were 125.43 +/- 30.94, 142.40 +/- 6.19 and 96.0 pg/ml on admission day, day 3 and day 14, respectively in the unfavorable group, while in the favorable group the mean values were 81.0 +/- 25.0, 69.95 +/- 20.33 and 55.36 +/- 15.59 pg/ml on admission, day 3 and day 14, respectively. ROC curve analysis of the mean values of S-100B was done whereby we found that at a cut off value was 115 pg/ml which can predict poor prognosis in TBI patients with a sensitivity of 60.71 % and a specificity of 95.45 % and PPV of 94.44 % and NPV of 65.63 % with accuracy of 76.0 %.

The role of monitoring autonomic nervous system in prognosis of brain trauma,Sabirov D.; Krasnenkova M. ,"Background and Goal of Study: The purpose of our study - to determine the possibility of altered HRV to reflect the degree of damage to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and predict outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute period. Material(s) and Method(s): 35 patients with TBI (30 men and 5 women) with an initial GCS score <= 8 were included in a prospective study. The mean age was 34.7 +/- 8.2 years. All examined patients were divided into 3 groups: I group - patients with fatal outcome - 9 patients (3-5 points on GCS), II group - 18 patients survived with good outcome (GCS >= 10 points) and group III - 8 patients with worse neurological status (GCS < 10 points). Performed invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP). Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed in two methods: temporal and spectral analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out in heart rate, ICP, CPP, pNN 50, rMSSD, TP, LnHF, LnLF and LFHF. We have compared the data of patients with HRS who died with HRV indices in the surviving patients on the day after the injury. To assess the impact of neurological disorders identified in the ANS, we compared the rates studied patients who survived with good outcome (GCS >= 10 points) and in patients with a worse neurological status (GCS < 10 points). Results and Discussion: The day after the injury showed a significant difference in parameters of HRV in patients who died with progressive brain edema regarding survivors. In the group who died there was a significant parasympathetic efferent hyperactivity and a tendency to decrease throughout the HRV. The group with poor recovery had a tendency towards low heart rate variability, suggesting a lower parasympathetic efferent activity. Some differences were greater (pNN 50, rMSSD, and LnHF indicators). Hemodynamic parameters were not different between groups. When comparing patients who died within 5 days after injury with those surviving the next day after receiving head trauma, significant increase in heart rate variability was associated with a significantly increased parasympathetic tone, relative to healthy subjects. In our study, the rate decreased LnLF below physiological values, and these changes were similar in all groups. Because of the tendency to a lower level of the ratio LFHF in the group died, we hypothesized that the relatively high LnLF observed in this group was associated with increased parasympathetic tone. Overall HRV differed significantly between the groups of survivors. Overall HRV was normal in patients with a GCS score of >= 10 and significantly decreased in patients with GCS < 10. Conclusion(s): 1) Changes in heart rate variability may reflect the degree of damage to cerebral function. 2) Reduced heart rate variability is associated with a worse clinical outcome and severe cerebral lesions.",2012,/,European Journal of Anaesthesiology,29,SUPPL. 50,111,,,71084353,#23965,Sabirov 2012,,yes
Predicting 14-day mortality after severe traumatic brain injury: Application of the IMPACT models in the brain trauma foundation TBI-trac New York state database,Roozenbeek B.; Chiu Y.-L.; Lingsma H.F.; Gerber L.M.; Steyerberg E.W.; Ghajar J.; Maas A.I.R. ,"Prognostic models for outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important instruments in both clinical practice and research. To remain current a continuous process of model validation is necessary. We aimed to investigate the performance of the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic models in predicting mortality in a contemporary New York State TBI registry developed and maintained by the Brain Trauma Foundation. The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) TBI-trac database contains data on 3125 patients who sustained severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score <= 8) in New York State between 2000 and 2009. The outcome measure was 14-day mortality. To predict 14-day mortality with admission data, we adapted the IMPACT Core and Extended models. Performance of the models was assessed by determining calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), and discrimination (separation of those patients who die from those who survive). Calibration was explored graphically with calibration plots. Discrimination was expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). A total of 2513 out of 3125 patients in the BTF database met the inclusion criteria. The 14-day mortality rate was 23%. The models showed excellent calibration. Mean predicted probabilities were 20% for the Core model and 24% for the Extended model. Both models showed good discrimination with AUCs of 0.79 (Core) and 0.83 (Extended). We conclude that the IMPACT models validly predict 14-day mortality in the BTF database, confirming generalizability of these models for outcome prediction in TBI patients.

Predictive value of cardiac troponin I in traumatic brain injury,Hamdi E.; Taema K.; Shehata M.; Radwan W. ,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a major public-health problem. Many research works aimed to identify early predictors of mortality and functional outcome. The cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation has also been observed in acute non traumatic head injuries and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate the prognostic implication of the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the traumatic brain injury patients. Method(s): Thirty two patients were enrolled in our prospective study (27 males, mean age 38.0+/-10.2 years), admitted to intensive care units in Cairo university hospitals with traumatic brain injury except those with associated co-morbidities that cause elevation of cTnI. Patients were stratified according to the severity of the injury, their outcome and prognosis using the Glasgow outcome scale(GCS),and APACHE II to be correlated with the cTnI. Result(s): Patients with poor prognosis following TBI were hemodynamically unstable (87 % Vs 12.5 %; P: 0.004), had lower GCS (10 Vs 6; P: 0.002), higher APACHE II score (16.8 Vs 9; P: 0.001), and higher incidence of post traumatic seizures (64 % Vs 11 %; P: 0.002). Patients with poor prognosis exhibited also a high cTnI level compared to patients with good prognosis (2.85 mug/L Vs 0.23 mug/L; P: 0.001). Conclusion(s): The elevated cTnI level together with lower GCS score higher APACHE II score, and the hemodynamic instability, are all good predictors for the poor outcome after TBI.",2012,/,"Egyptian Journal of Neurology, Psychiatry and Neurosurgery",49,4,365-373,,,368489043,#23909,Hamdi 2012,,yes
Intraventricular hemorrhage on computed tomography and corpus callosum injury on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with isolated blunt traumatic brain injury: Clinical article,Matsukawa H.; Shinoda M.; Fujii M.; Takahashi O.; Murakata A.; Yamamoto D.; Sumiyoshi S.; Ishikawa R. ,"Object. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is widely regarded as one element of a complex involving severe blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI); corpus callosum injury (CCI) is recently considered to be one factor associated with poor outcome in patients with TBI. Although postmortem studies have focused on the relationship between IVH and CCI, there have been few investigations of IVH evidenced on CT scans as a predictor of CCI evidenced on MRI. Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from 371 patients with blunt TBI, without trauma to the face, chest, abdomen, extremities, or pelvic girdle, requiring immediate therapeutic intervention. Their aim was to investigate whether IVH found on CT predicts CCI on MRI. Clinical and radiological data were collected between June 2003 and February 2011. First, the authors classified patients into groups of those with CCI and those without CCI, and they compared clinical and radiological findings between them. Then, they investigated prognostic factors that were related to the development of disability at 6 months after injury. The outcomes at 6 months after injury were evaluated using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E). Finally, the authors evaluated the correlation between the severity of the IVH on CT and the number of CCI lesions on MRI. The severity of the IVH was defined by the number of ventricles in which IVH was seen, and the number of CCI lesions was counted on the MRI study. Results. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 (OR 2.70 [95% CI 1.10-6.27]), traffic accident (OR 2.59 [95% CI 1.37-4.93]), and IVH on CT (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.25-8.49]) were significantly related to CCI. Multivariate analysis also showed that older age (p = 0.0001), male sex (OR 3.26 [95% CI 1.46-8.08], p = 0.0065), Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 (OR 8.27 [95% CI 3.39-21.4], p < 0.0001), evidence of IVH on CT (OR 4.09 [95% CI 1.45-11.9], p = 0.0081), and evidence of CCI on MRI (OR 8.32 [95% CI 3.89-18.8], p < 0.0001) were associated with future development of disability (GOS-E score <= 6). Furthermore, simple regression analysis revealed the existence of a strong correlation between the severity of IVH and the number of CCI lesions (r = 0.0668, p = 0.0022). Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that evidence of IVH on CT may indicate CCI, which can lead to disability in patients with isolated blunt TBI.",2012,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,117,2,334-339,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2012.5.JNS112318,365374083,#23857,Matsukawa 2012,,yes
Pupil evaluation in addition to Glasgow Coma Scale components in prediction of traumatic brain injury and mortality,Hoffmann M.; Lefering R.; Rueger J.M.; Kolb J.P.; Izbicki J.R.; Ruecker A.H.; Rupprecht M.; Lehmann W. ,"Background: Early diagnosis and prediction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for determining treatment strategies and allocating resources. This study evaluated the predictive accuracy of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) verbal, motor and eye components alone, or in addition to pupil size and reactivity, for TBI. Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of data from 51 425 severely injured patients registered in the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery from 1993 to 2009 was undertaken. Only directly admitted patients alive on admission and with complete data on GCS, pupil size and pupil reactivity were included. The unadjusted predictive roles of GCS components and pupil parameters, alone or in combination, were modelled using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses and multivariable logistic regression regarding presence of TBI and death. Result(s): Some 24 115 patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Best accuracy for outcome prediction was found for pupil reactivity (AUROC 0.770, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.761 to 0.779) and GCS motor component (AUROC 0.797, 0.788 to 0.805), with less accuracy for GCS eye and verbal components. The combination of pupil reactivity and GCS motor component (AUROC 0.822, 0.814 to 0.830) outmatched the predictive accuracy of GCS alone (AUROC 0.808, 0.800 to 0.815). Pupil reactivity and size were significantly correlated (rs = 0.56, P < 0.001). Patients displaying both unequal pupils and fixed pupils were most likely to have TBI (95.1 per cent of 283 patients). Good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or more) was documented for only 1929 patients (8.0 per cent) showing fixed and bilateral dilated pupils. Conclusion(s): The best predictive accuracy for presence of TBI was obtained using the GCS components. Pupil reactivity together with the GCS motor component performed best in predicting death.

Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NFL) correlate to 1-year outcome after a severe traumatic brain injury,Nellgard B.; Ost M. ,"Background: Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI), is the most common cause of death in persons below 40 years. There is a lack of valid prognostic factors to be monitored during the initial hospital stay in these patients. In this prospective study in patients with STBI we have correlated concentrations of GFAP and NFL in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to clinical outcome at 1 year. Method(s): Patients (n=54), aged above 18 years, were included immediately after STBI (ie, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <9), and an intraventricular catheter was placed within 48 hours after admittance to a neuro intensive care unit at a tertiary university hospital. CSF was prospectively sampled from the intraventricular catheter on days; 0 (trauma day), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. The CSF was stored in -70C in small aliquots and CSFGFAP was analyzed with a modified sandwich ELIZA technique and CSF-NFL with an ELIZA technique. CSF-GFAP and CSF-NFL concentrations were then correlated to 1-year outcome utilizing the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS; GOS 1=dead and GOS 5=totally recovered), graded by a neurologist blinded to results of chemical analyses. Spearman rank test was used for evaluation of outcome. Result(s): During the initial posttraumatic days CSF-GFAP and CSFNFL levels both increased and the increase was correlated to 1-year (Figure Presented) outcome (P<0.002). After dichotomizing the results into dead (GOS 1) versus alive (GOS 2 to 5) increased CSF-GFAP (P=0.0028) and CSFNFL (P=0.0043) concentrations both correlated to outcome. Similarly, when dichotomizing the results into bad outcome (GOS 1 to 3) and good outcome (GOS 4 to 5) both CSF-GFAP (P=0.0038) and CSF-NFL (P=0.006) concentrations were significantly increased in those with bad outcome. Odds ratio was calculated demonstrating that both CSFGFAP and CSF-NFL concentrations increased posttrauma and these correlated to bad outcome at 1 year (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Early analyses of CSF-GFAP and CSF-NFL may have important prognostic value in patients with severe TBI. In the future, daily measurements of these neuromarkers, may change treatment paradigms and prognosticate long-term outcome in these patients.",2013,/,Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology,25,4,452,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0b013e3182a4d5ff,71215439,#23761,Nellgard 2013,,yes
Geriatric tbi in Japan-lessons from the country with highest longevity: Report from the japan neurotrauma data bank (JNTDB) project 1999-2009,Yokobori S.; Araki T.; Onda H.; Matsumoto G.; Takayama Y.; Fuse A.; Yokota H. ,"Introduction With the rapid expansion of the elderly population, Japan has been the ''world model'' for the health of the elderly in society with the rapid increase of the elderly population. An abrupt increase of geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients also has been seen in Japan. To clarify the management of geriatric TBI and assess the effect of aggressive treatment and patient outcome in geriatric TBI patients, we analyzed the prospective data of the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank (JNTDB) Project 1998 (P1998), 2004 (P2004), and 2009 (P2009). In addition, the functional prognostic factors in geriatric TBI were also examined with these data. Methods Of the 3,194 cases in JNTDB P1998, P2004, and P2009, 1,165 geriatric TBI cases ( >= 65 years old) were enrolled in this study. The clinical features, aggressive treatments (surgical procedure/intensive temperature treatment/ICP monitoring) and outcomes based on Glasgow Outcome Scale on discharge were compared among P1998, P2004, and P2009. Moreover, to clarify the functional prognostic factors in geriatric TBI patients, logistic regression analysis was performed. Results The percentage of the geriatric TBI population significantly increased throughout the three project years. (P1998; 30.5%, P2004; 34.6%, P2009; 43.9%, p < 0.0001). Aggressive treatments were performed in 71.4% of geriatric patients in P2009 and this percentage was significantly increased from P1998 to P2009. With these aggressive efforts for geriatric TBI care, mortality significantly decreased (P1998; 62.7%, P2009; 51.1%, p = 0.0003). On the other hand, the percentage of severe disability and dependent survivors were increased (P1998; 63.2%, P2009; 68.4%). Patient Age >= 75, Injury Severity Score >= 21, GCS <= 8, existence of traumatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH), and existence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were clarified as the poor-functional prognostic factors. IVH was the strongest negative functional prognostic factor for geriatric TBI patients (OR 5.762, 95%CI 1.317-25.216). Conclusions Our result revealed that the aggressive treatments had lowered mortality in geriatric TBI patients. On the other hand, the aggressive treatments did not result in better functional outcome in this population. For decision-making of aggressive treatments in geriatric TBI, patient age, initial GCS, and anatomical severity including SAH and IVH seemed to be most helpful as functional prognostic factors. To reduce futile survival with poor quality of life, miserable prognosis in geriatric TBI, specific new treatments including neoneurogenesis/ neuroprotection and better rehabilitation will be needed in this population. The Japan Society of Neurotraumatology also should make further efforts for the enlightenment of primary prevention of geriatric TBI and revise the framework of geriatric TBI guidelines.",2013,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,30,15,A43,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.9938,71142714,#23726,Yokobori 2013,,yes
Logistic regression modeling as an analytic platform to provide valid individualized prognostic information from continuous realtime monitoring data in the neuro-trauma critical care unit,Chen H.H.; Yang S.; Hu P.; Stansbury L.G.; Miller C.; Stein D.M.; Scalea T.M. ,"Introduction Bedside clinical monitors that can derive valid prognostic information from ongoing, real-time, patient data accrual and analysis are an unmet objective for critical care clinicians, electrical engineers, and computer scientists. We asked whether a simple logistic regression (LR) model had the power to provide the analytic platform for such instrumentation. Methods Continuous electronic vital signs (VS) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring data were collected from 191 adult ( > 17 years) severe traumatic brain injury patients admitted to our neurotrauma critical care unit. Using age, sex, admission and neurologist Glasgow Coma Scale scores and quartiles of VS and ICP as predictors, LR models were performed on all who survived to discharge (G1) and all but those with care withdrawn at the family's request (G2). We then determined the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) for prediction of good/bad outcome at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge for G1 and G2, and hospital mortality for G2, using these predictors and LR. To test the regression model's ability to absorb accrual of new data, we cross-validated with a classic, 10-fold-times-10 procedure, using 90% of the data as the training set and 10% of the data as the testing set. Results Complete data were available for analysis at the various outcome periods on 113 +/- 116 patients for group G1 and 129 +/- 169 for group G2. ROCs AUC for the logistic regression model were 0.85 (G1, n = 113) and 0.86 (G2, n = 129) at 6 weeks, 0.88 (G1, n = 116) and 0.87 (G2, n = 142) at 3 months, 0.90 (G1, n = 115) and 0.90 (G2, n = 141) at 6 months, and 0.92 (G1, n = 113) and 0.89 (G2, n = 139) at 12 months. ROC AUC for mortality in group G2 was 0.94 (n = 169). The Results for the training run were essentially the same as using all data, but results for the incoming, ""new"" data were reduced by 5 to 10%. Conclusions In our two study groups, LR modeling provided excellent overall prediction of functional outcome at clinically useful time periods and was more robust than the machine learning models that our group has tested in previous work. Cross-validation showed that the model performed very well when ""trained"" with 90% of the data, but when tested with the remaining 10% of the data, analogous to the presentation of new patient data from ongoing collection, ROC-AUCs diminished, albeit not hugely.

Convergence insufficiency as a predictor of poor prognosis after acute traumatic brain injury,Ganti L.; Ayala S.; Patel P.; Daneshvar Y.; Bodhit A.; Hatchitt K.; Mazzuoccolo A.; Hoelle R.; Falgiani M.; Khalid H.; Kharod S.; Maerz P.; Conroy L.; Gabrielli A.; Peters K. ,"Introduction Background: TBI is becoming a more and more common emergency department (ED) presentation, and has many reported sequelae. Towards this end, many types of testing in the acute setting are being investigated. One of these is convergence insufficiency (CSI) testing. CSI is a condition in which a patient finds it difficult to maintain alignment of the eyes on a near object. Inability to sustain convergence may cause a person to look with just one eye at a time, or to see double. These are common problems reported by patients with TBI, but such oculomotor testing is rarely done in the ED. Objective(s): We wanted to study the feasibility of doing CSI testing in the ED, and investigate whether the patient is more likely to experience post concussive symptoms, and require repeated visits to the hospital. Methods Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from patients age>18 who experienced a head injury from any mechanism. Patients underwent CSI using a standardized instrument of 14 questions, with responses based on the Likert scale. These data were correlated to outcomes of hospital admission, occurrence of post-concussive symptoms, and 30- day hospital re-admission Results A total of 104 patients were prospectively enrolled, of which 56 were men. The median age was 31, range 18-95. The median CSI score was 13, IQR 6-21, range 0-53. Men had a higher median CSI score (14 vs. 10 for women). The higher the CSI score, the more likely they were to be admitted to the hospital (p=0.0435), develop symptoms of post concussive syndrome (p=0.0721) and be readmitted within 30d (p=0.0098). Conclusions CSI can be a solid adjunct in the evaluation of acute head injury in the ED. It is easy and fast to administer, and useful to risk stratify patients in terms of who is at highest risk of developing complications.",2013,/,Neurocritical Care,19,1 SUPPL. 1,S63,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-013-9895-1,71194522,#23717,Ganti 2013,,yes
Relation between mortality in the hospital and at 1 year with the cranial ct evaluated using the marshall classification classification classification classification classification in patients with traumatic brain injury,Prieto-Palomino M.A.; Arias-Verdu M.; Curiel Balsera E.; Delange-Van Der Kroff M.; Dominguez-Paez M.; Macias-Guarasa I.; Fernandez-Ortega P.; Rivera-Fernandez R. ,"Objective. To evaluate in patients admitted to the ICU with traumatic brain injury (TBI) the relation between the cranial CT findings on admission using the Marshall classification and hospital and 1-year mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A prospective cohort study of patients admitted consecutively to the ICU of Carlos Haya hospital, Malaga with TBI in 2004-2008. Data were recorded on different scores of severity and cranial CT on admission using the Marshall classification. The results were analyzed on discharge and at 1 year. RESULTS. The cohort comprised 531 patients, aged 40.35 +/-: 19.75 years; 152 (28.6 %) died in the hospital and 171 (32.2 %) had died at one year; 35 (6.6 %) were lost to followup. The patients who died in the hospital were older (47.07 +/-: 21.41 vs. 37.65 +/-: 18.38, p\0.001), had a higher APACHE II (23.71 +/-: 6.23 vs. 15.63 +/-: 5.82, p\0.001), and lower Glasgow (5.17 +/-: 3.01 vs. 8.47 +/-: 3.71, p\0.001). Mortality was significantly related with the morphological CT lesion on admission, such that mortality in patients with diffuse Type I injury (N = 55) was 5.5 %, in those with Type II injury (N = 149) it was 8.1 %, in those with Type III injury (N = 130) it was 31.5 %, and in those with Type IV injury (N = 44) it was 68.2 %. Mortality in those with an evacuated mass (N = 120) was 36.7 % and in those with a non-evacuated mass (N = 33) it was 66.7 %; p\0.001. The logistic regression analysis showed that hospital mortality was associated with Apache II (OR 1.127, CI 1.071-1.186), age (OR 1.027, CI 1.012-1.042), ISS (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05), Glasgow score on admission (OR 0.875, CI 0.791-0.969), and the admission CT: diffuse Type I lesion (OR 1), Type II (OR 1.419, CI 0.319-6.363), Type III (OR 4.137, CI 1.002-17.074) and Type IV (OR 15.637, CI 3.35-79.919); evacuated mass (OR 6.907, CI 1.622-29.41), non-evacuated mass (OR 19.953, CI 3.834-103.831). Mortality at 1 year was related in multiple logistic regression with the APACHE II (OR 1.131, CI 1.075-1.19), age (OR 1.039, CI 1.024-1.054), ISS (OR 1.025, CI 1.0006-1.044), Glasgow coma score on admission (OR 0.876, CI 0.793-0.967), and the Marshall classification: diffuse Type I lesion (OR 1), Type II (OR 2.98, CI 0.677-13.124), Type III (OR 5.092, CI 1.201-21.582), and Type IV (OR 17.227, CI 3.60-82.445); evacuated mass (OR 10.127, CI 2.315-44.301), non-evacuated mass (OR 26.769, CI 2.315-44.301). CONCLUSION. The CT lesion on admission done routinely in patients with TBI admitted to the ICU and evaluated according to theMarshall classification correlates well with mortality in the hospital and at 1 year. It also provides additional information about the widely known prognostic factors, such as the APACHE II and ISS, age, and Glasgow coma scale.",2013,/,Intensive Care Medicine,39,SUPPL. 2,S260,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-3095-5,71446122,#23707,Prieto-Palomino 2013,,yes
Correlation between Glasgow coma scale and Jugular venous oxygen saturation in severe traumatic brain injury,Sharf M.S.; El-Gebali M.A. ,"Background Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) remains a key measure in neurological assessment after head injury and in most studies classification of the severity of the trauma is still based on the admission GCS. The aim of the work The aim of the work was to correlate between Jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjvo2) with GCS in cases with severe traumatic brain injury. Patients and methods A 44 patients met the inclusion criteria, were included in the present study. They were selected from the neurosurgical and intensive care units at Al-Azhar University hospital during the period from June 2010 till June 2012. All therapeutic interventions were performed in accordance with Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury. The following variables were collected: patients' demographics, Sjvo2, ICP, MAP, CPP and GCS. All pressures were monitored invasively and with identical transducers connected to monitors, and expressed numerically in mmHg. Measurements were always performed at 8.00 a.m. At the same time, patients were neurologically examined and these data were expressed as GCS score. Results There was statistically significant increase of GCS, MAP, CPP, Sjvo2 and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and decrease of ICP in survived in comparison to non-survived cases. In survived cases, there was positive significant correlation between Sjvo2 and GCS, MAP, CPP and GOSE, while there was significant negative correlation with ICT. On the other hand, in non-survived cases, there was only positive moderate, significant correlation between Sjvo2 and GCS. Running simple linear regression analysis, only GCS and Sjvo2 can predict mortality in studied cases. Conclusion Results of the present study proved that, Sjvo2 is proportionally correlated with GCS and both can predict the prognosis of severe traumatic injury.

Evidence that the blood biomarker SNTF predicts brain imaging changes and persistent cognitive dysfunction in mild TBI patients,Siman R.; Giovannone N.; Hanten G.; Wilde E.A.; McCauley S.R.; Hunter J.V.; Li X.; Levin H.S.; Smith D.H. ,"Although mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is not typically associated with abnormalities on computed tomography (CT), it nevertheless causes persistent cognitive dysfunction for many patients. Consequently, new prognostic methods for mTBI are needed to identify at risk cases, especially at an early and potentially treatable stage. Here, we quantified plasma levels of the neurodegeneration biomarker calpain-cleaved aII-spectrin N-terminal fragment (SNTF) from 38 participants with CT-negative mTBI, orthopedic injury (OI), and normal uninjured controls (UCs) (age range 12-30 years), and compared them with findings from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and long-term cognitive assessment. SNTF levels were at least twice the lower limit of detection in 7 of 17 mTBI cases and in 3 of 13 OI cases, but in none of the UCs. An elevation in plasma SNTF corresponded with significant differences in fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient in the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus measured by DTI. Furthermore, increased plasma SNTF on the day of injury correlated significantly with cognitive impairment that persisted for at least 3 months, both across all study participants and also among the mTBI cases by themselves. The elevation in plasma SNTF in the subset of OI cases, accompanied by corresponding white matter and cognitive abnormalities, raises the possibility of identifying undiagnosed cases of mTBI. These data suggest that the blood level of SNTF on the day of a CT-negative mTBI may identify a subset of patients at risk of white matter damage and persistent disability. SNTF could have prognostic and diagnostic utilities in the assessment and treatment of mTBI.

Predictive value of S-100s protein for prognosis in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis,Mercier E.; Boutin A.; Lauzier F.; Fergusson D.A.; Simard J.-F.; Zarychanski R.; Moore L.; McIntyre L.A.; Archambault P.; Lamontagne F.; Legare F.; Randell E.; Nadeau L.; Rousseau F.; Turgeon A.F. ,"Objectives: To determine the ability and accuracy of the S-100s protein in predicting prognosis after a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Design(s): Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, BIOSIS (from their inception to April 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographies of eligible articles, and relevant narrative reviews. Study selection: Two reviewers independently reviewed citations and selected eligible studies, defined as cohort studies or randomised control trials including patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury and evaluating the prognostic value of S-100s protein. Outcomes evaluated were mortality, score on the Glasgow outcome scale, or brain death. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data using a standardised form and evaluated the methodological quality of included studies. Pooled results were presented with geometric means ratios and analysed with random effect models. Prespecified sensitivity analyses were performed to explain heterogeneity. Result(s): The search strategy yielded 9228 citations. Two randomised controlled trials and 39 cohort studies were considered eligible (1862 patients). Most studies (n=23) considered Glasgow outcome score =3 as an unfavourable outcome. All studies reported at least one measurement of S-100s within 24 hours after traumatic brain injury. There was a significant positive association between S-100s protein concentrations and mortality (12 studies: geometric mean ratio 2.55, 95% confidence interval 2.02 to 3.21, I2=56%) and score =3 (18 studies: 2.62, 2.01 to 3.42, I 2=79%). Sensitivity analysis based on sampling time, sampling type, blinding of outcome assessors, and timing of outcome assessment yielded similar results. Thresholds for serum S-100s protein values with 100% specificity ranged from 1.38 to 10.50 mug/L for mortality (six studies) and from 2.16 to 14.00 mug/L for unfavourable neurological prognosis as defined by the Glasgow outcome score. Conclusion(s): After moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, serum S-100s protein concentrations are significantly associated with unfavourable prognosis in the short, mid, or long term. Optimal thresholds for discrimination remain unclear. Measuring the S-100s protein could be useful in evaluating the severity of traumatic brain injury and in the determination of long term prognosis in patients with moderate and severe injury.",2013,/,BMJ (Online),346,7906,f1757,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f1757,368890270,#23584,Mercier 2013,,yes

Coagulopathy as prognostic marker in acute traumatic brain injury,Chhabra G.; Sharma S.; Subramanian A.; Agrawal D.; Sinha S.; Mukhopadhyay A.K. ,"Context: Coagulopathy frequently occurs following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and usually occurs 6-72 hour post-trauma. The incidence and the probable risk factors for development of coagulopathy and poor outcome following TBI are largely unknown and vary considerably. Aim(s): To assess the incidence and probable risk factors for development of coagulopathy and to identify the risk factors for poor outcome in terms of median survival time following TBI. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study over two years, patients of isolated moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (GCS<=12) admitted to trauma center had coagulation profile (PT, APTT, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimer), arterial lactate and ABG analysis done on day of admission and on day three. Coagulopathy was defined as prothrombin time (PT) or/and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) more than 1.5 times the normal control. Incidence of in-hospital mortality was assessed in all cases. Statistical Analysis: A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for coagulopathy and mortality in these patients. Result(s): A total of 208 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 32 +/- 12 years and mean GCS was 7.1 +/- 2.8. Coagulopathy was present in 46% ( n = 96) of patients. Risk factors for development of coagulopathy were found out to be severity of head injury (OR: 2.81), elevated D-dimer (OR: 3.43), low hemoglobin (OR: 3.13), and effaced cisterns in the CT scan (OR: 2.72). Presence of coagulopathy (OR: 2.97) and severity of head injury (OR: 5.70) strongly predicted poor outcome, and were associated with a decreased median survival time.

Environmental enrichment may protect against hippocampal atrophy in the chronic stages of traumatic brain injury,Miller L.S.; Colella B.; Mikulis D.; Maller J.; Green R.E.A. ,"Objective: To examine the relationship between environmental enrichment (EE) and hippocampal atrophy in the chronic stages of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design(s): Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data; observational, within-subjects. Participant(s): Patients (N = 25) with moderate to severe TBI. Measures: Primary predictors: (1) An aggregate of self-report rating of EE (comprising hours of cognitive, physical, and social activities) at 5 months post-injury; (2) pre-injury years of education as a proxy for pre-morbid EE (or cognitive reserve). Primary Outcome: bilateral hippocampal volume change from 5 to 28 months post-injury. Result(s): As predicted, self-reported EE was significantly negatively correlated with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (p < 0.05), with greater EE associated with less atrophy from 5 to 28 months. Contrary to prediction, years of education (a proxy for cognitive reserve) was not significantly associated with atrophy. Conclusion(s): Post-injury EE may serve as a buffer against hippocampal atrophy in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI. Clinical application of EE should be considered for optimal maintenance of neurological functioning in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI.

Role of Phosphorylated Neurofilament H as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in traumatic brain injury,Ghonemi M.O.; Rabah A.A.; Saber H.M.; Radwan W. ,"Background and purpose: One of the main drawbacks in the management of patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) is the absence of a widely available and rapid diagnostic test. The objective of our study was to assess whether Phosphorylated Neurofilament H (pNF-H) might provide useful diagnostic information as an indication of axonal injury in the early evaluation of such patients and whether levels of the pNF-H correlated with different clinical variables. Method(s): A total of 30 patients presenting to the critical care department of Cairo University diagnosed with traumatic brain injury were prospectively studied. Blood samples for pNF-H were assayed on admission and after 7. days. Neurofilament levels correlated with Glasgow coma scale and CT findings on admission and after 7. days. Rankin score at 3. months was used to detect the degree of disability. Result(s): Phosphorylated Neurofilament H levels showed a negative correlation with GCS on admission and after 7. days in traumatic brain injury; hence higher neuromarker levels were associated with lower GCS on admission and after 7. days. There was a negative correlation between neurofilament levels and Marshal CT scores on admission and after 7. days (r=. 0.56.0.4) hence higher neurofilament levels correlated with worse CT findings. Patients who died or had the greatest Rankin 6 and 5 after 3. months had the highest levels of pNF-H on admission and after 7. days. The cut off level of pNF-H to detect death and disability was 35. pg/ml on admission (sensitivity 82%, specificity 78%) and was 11. pg/ml after 7. days (sensitivity87%, and specificity 92%). Conclusion(s): Phosphorylated Neurofilament H can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with TBI as seen by the presence of significant correlations between the marker levels and different clinical and radiological tools.

Severe traumatic brain injury patients in Northern Sweden computed tomography and clinical outcomes,Stenberg M.; Koskinen L.-O.; Levi R.; Jonasson P.; Stalnacke B.-M. ,"Objectives: Following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), computed tomography (CT) is the most frequently used neuroimaging method for assessment of the severity of the injury and a criterion for further treatment. Patients with sTBI are an heterogeneous group with varying complexity and prognosis. It is, therefore, of importance to find instruments that could be used early after the injury to identify the individual's need of rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between early CT scan and key clinical outcomes at 3 months and 1 year after injury. Method(s): This is a prospective, cohort study conducted at the Neurotrauma Centre (NC), at the Umea University Hospital, Sweden from January 2010 to December 2011. Consecutive patients with acute sTBI, aged 17-65 years, lowest non-sedated Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-8 within 24 hours post-trauma were included. Patients were treated according to an intracranial pressure (ICP)- oriented protocol based on the Lund concept. The first available CT scans (CT1) and follow-up scans nearest to 24 hours (CT24) were evaluated using the Marshall and Rotterdam classifications. Patients were assessed at 3 months and 1 year after injury with the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale Revised (RLAS-R) and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E). Result(s): A total of 37 patients were included. Mean age was 41.3 years. Median lowest unsedated GCS was 5 (range=3-8). Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) was very severe (>7 days) in 36 (97%) patients and severe (1-7 days) in one (3%) patient. Median stay at intensive care was 17 days (range=2-54). Hospital deaths during the first year occurred in six patients (16%). The RLAS-R and the GOS-E scores were significantly improved from 3 months to 1 year after the injury (RLAS-R: 8.00 +/- 2.4 vs 8.9 +/- 1.9, p=0.003; GOS-E 4.4 +/- 2.3 vs 5.5 +/- 2.7, p=0.003, Wilcoxon's signed-ranks-test). There were significant correlations at 3 months between Marshall CT1 and CT24 and RLAS-R (CT1: p=0.044, r=-0.364; CT24: p=0.024, r=-0.425, Spearman's correlation coefficient). The Rotterdam CT24 was significantly correlated to GOS-E at 3 months (p=0.015, r=-0.421, Spearman's correlation coefficient). The CT1 and the CT24 Marshall and Rotterdam classifications did not significantly correlate to the GOS-E and RLAS-R scores at 1 year. Conclusion(s): Clinical outcome assessed as GOS-E and RLAS-R improved during the first year after sTBI. The CT classifications were only associated with the GOS-E and RLAS-R scores at 3 months. Thus, the results in this specific patient cohort indicate that the CT classification systems used is not valid enough to judge the need for rehabilitation. As the patients clearly improve with time, the authors recommend an appropriate rehabilitation of sTBI patients in spite of initial severe symptoms.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,593,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445060,#23439,Stenberg 2014,,yes
"Prediction of long-term mortality in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) using age, sex, walking and feeding skills",Brooks J.; Strauss D.; Shavelle R.; Hammond F.; Harrison-Felix C. ,"Objectives: To assess the validity of prognostic models for long-term mortality in adults with TBI using two independent study populations and to investigate whether mortality rates and ratios have changed over the last two decades. Method(s): Two cohorts of long-term survivors of TBI were considered. The first comprised participants in the US National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) national database who were injured in the years 1988-2010, had been discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and who provided follow-up information 1 year or later after injury. Walking and feeding skills were classified using the Functional Independence Measure. The second cohort included clients of the California Department of Developmental Services (CADDS) during years 1988-2010, who had an indication of TBI (ICD-9 codes 800-804 or 850-854) or were involved in a motor vehicle accident that led to significant cognitive disabilities. For these individuals, walking and feeding skills were classified using the Client Development Evaluation Report. Regression models for survival data with time-dependent covariates were fit on each database independently. Covariates included age, sex, walking and feeding skills and calendar year. Predictive accuracy was assessed using two-sample cross-validation. The model fitted to the CADDS data was used to predict mortality for persons in the TBIMS; and vice versa. This study computed the ratio of the observed number of deaths to the number of deaths expected under each model. Statistical inference was based on the assumption that the observed death counts followed a Poisson distribution. Result(s): The CADDS cohort included 5352 persons, of whom 602 died during the study period. These individuals contributed 55 621 personyears of follow-up. The TBIMS cohort comprised 7228 persons, of whom 537 died. These individuals contributed 32 505 person-years of follow-up. Current age, sex, walking and feeding skills were significant predictors of long-term mortality rates (all p<0.0001 both databases). Calendar year was not significantly associated with mortality rates (p>0.05 both databases). The mortality ratio between persons with TBI and the US general population increased over the study period (p<0.05 both databases). The CADDS-fitted model predicted 534 deaths for persons in the TBIMS database, for an observed-toexpected ratio of 1.01 (95% CI=0.92-1.10). The TBIMS-fitted model predicted a total of 575 deaths for persons in the CADDS database, for an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.05 (95% CI=0.96-1.13). Conclusion(s): The close agreement between predicted and observed mortality suggests that these models may be generally applicable to persons from other populations with moderate-to-severe TBI. Because there have been no significant time trends in long-term mortality rates, the prognostic models may remain valid over the next several decades. The increase in the mortality ratio contradicts speculation that life expectancy in TBI has improved along with that of the general population.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,694,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445302,#23436,Brooks 2014,,yes
Predictive value of hyperthermia and intracranial hypertension on neurological outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,Bonds B.; Hu P.; Li Y.; Yang S.; Colton K.; Grissom T.; Fang R.; Stein D.M. ,"Objectives: Intracranial hypertension (ICH) and hyperthermia have been shown to be common findings following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are aggressively monitored and managed in the intensive care (ICU) setting. TBI management protocols often advocate maintenance of normothermia and avoidance of ICH based on evidence that these factors are associated with worse short and longterm outcomes. This study sets out to determine the combined power of temperature and intracranial pressure (ICP) in the ICU setting for predicting mortality, intensive care length of stay (ICU-LOS) and neurologic outcomes in patients with severe TBI. Method(s): High resolution (every 6 seconds) temperature and ICP data were collected in 191 adults with severe TBI from 2009-2010 at a level 1 trauma centre. Body temperatures were plotted against concurrent ICP and divided into nine sections based on breakpoints of temperature (<36, 36-38.5, >38.5degreeC) and ICP (<20, 20-30 or >30mm Hg). These data were then compared to the following outcomes: mortality, ICU-LOS>7 days and short-term (<6 months) vs long-term (>6 months) dichotomized neurologic outcomes determined by a blinded evaluator. The percentage of time spent in each section, as well as several pooled unfavourable conditions (hyperthermia +/- ICH), were then evaluated for predictive value by examining the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve with a p value<0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): Patients with at least 50% collection of high resolution temperature and ICP data with clinical follow-up were included for analysis. This sub-set of adults (n=38, age 41.39, 18-83) were 2:1 male with severe TBI (head AIS=4.14, GCS=7.15, ISS=28), primarily as a result of blunt trauma. Evaluation of the AUC revealed that significant periods of high fever and high ICP (<30 mmHg) over the course of 4 days were shown to have a strong association with poor long-term neurological outcomes. This predictive value became significant at day 3 (AUC=0.7143, p=0.035) and peaked at day 4 (AUC=0.7387, p=0.02) for poor long-term outcome. Early fever with ICP<20mm Hg interestingly showed an association with poor longterm outcome when seen on day 1 (AUC=0.7257, p=0.057). ICU LOS>7 days was expectantly increased when hyperthermia and/or ICH was uncontrolled by day 5 (AUC=0.8162, p=0.018). However, there was no significant predictive value seen for in-hospital mortality by fever or ICH. Summary: Increased occurrences of hyperthermia combined with intracranial hypertension showed to be significant prognostic indicators of future poor neurologic outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The strongest predictive value occurred when these conditions were uncontrolled for >3 days despite multiple interventions.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,703-704,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445323,#23435,Bonds 2014,,yes
A simple web-based calculator for long-term survival prognosis in adults with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI),Brooks J.; Strauss D.; Shavelle R.; Hammond F.; Harrison-Felix C. ,"Objectives: To construct a simple evidence-based tool to assist in long-term survival prognosis for adults with moderate-tosevere TBI. Method(s): The study population comprised participants in the US National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research TBI Model Systems national database who were injured in the years 1988-2010, had been discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and contributed at least one follow-up assessment 1 year or more after injury. Long-term disability was classified using both the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS). A simple 4-level classification of care needs was constructed based on the single DRS item for 'level of functioning'. The levels were: (1) largely independent, minimal assistance at most; (2) requires mechanical aids or assistance with some activities; (3) requires assistance with all activities, 24-hour home care; and (4) total dependence, requires 24-hour nursing care. These classifications may be readily made in the clinic, via phone interview or through record review. Regression models for survival data were used to relate age, sex and severity of disability to long-term survival. Predictive performance of the models was assessed with the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the C-index for rightcensored survival data. Result(s): There were 7228 individuals in the US Model Systems national database who contributed 32 505 person-years of follow-up and 537 deaths. Age and sex were significantly associated with mortality rates in all survival regression models (p<0.0001). Separate models in which long-term disability was classified using the FIM and DRS had comparable predictive performance (C-index 0.80 vs 0.80, AIC 11 005 vs 11 015). The simple care needs model had a C-index of 0.80 and AIC of 11 040. Under this model, persons with the most intensive care needs, i.e. 24-hour nursing care, had mortality rates that were 8.2-times higher than those of persons who were largely independent or required minimal assistance at most (p<0.0001). Survival prognosis probabilities based on this simple model were incorporated into a web-based calculator available at: http://www.LifeExpectancy.org/ tbims.shtml. Conclusion(s): The extent of an individual's care needs is a simple but effective predictor of long-term survival in adults with moderate-tosevere TBI. The simple model has comparable statistical performance to alternative models that incorporate the full DRS and FIM scales.

Diffusion tensor imaging for outcome prediction in complicated and uncomplicated mild traumatic brain injury: A TRACK-TBI study,Yuh E.; Cooper S.; Mukherjee P.; Yue J.; Lingsma H.; Gordon W.; Valadka A.; Okonkwo D.; Schnyer D.; Vassar M.; Maas A.; Casey S.; Cheong M.; Dams-O'Connor K.; Hricik A.; Inoue T.; Menon D.; Pacheco J.; Puccio A.; Manley G. ,"Objectives: There is growing recognition that current classification schemes for mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) based solely on Glasgow Coma Scale and duration of post-traumatic amnesia and loss of consciousness are very limited, with small mean effect sizes in long-term impairment obscuring differences among diverse subgroups of MTBI patients with very different prognoses. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising technique for identification of microstructural white matter damage after traumatic brain injury. Although group differences in DTI parameters between MTBI patients and controls have been demonstrated, there has been little exploration of the practical use of acute/sub-acute DTI data for outcome prediction in the individual patient after controlling for demographic, clinical and CT and conventional MRI predictors. Method(s): This study evaluated DTI at 3 Tesla for evidence of white matter injury in 37 adult MTBI patients at the semi-acute stage (10.9 +/- 3.6 days) after injury, employing both whole-brain voxelwise analysis and a complementary region-of-interest (ROI) approach. Because whole-brain voxelwise approaches may have limited sensitivity due to the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of white matter injury in MTBI, while the ROI approach may be limited by failure to interrogate less common areas of white matter injury, both methods were employed as complementary approaches in the current study. Result(s): Complicated MTBI, defined as presence of any acute traumatic intracranial lesion and/or depressed skull fracture on day-of-admission CT or semi-acute 3-Tesla MRI, was associated with significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the internal and external capsules, uncinate fasciculi, genu of corpus callosum and corona radiata compared to 50 control subjects. In contrast, no significant group differences were found in FA between uncomplicated MTBI and control subjects, using either whole-brain voxelwise or ROI methods. To determine the clinical relevance of DTI findings to outcome, this study assessed for correlations between 3- and 6-month outcome measures and DTI, CT and MRI findings and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical predictors. MRI features, including DTI parameters, surpassed other variables for prediction of 3- and 6-month outcome. The best predictors of 3-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) were DTI evidence of one or more ROIs with severely reduced FA (univariate odds ratio 8.0 per unit decrease in 3-month GOS-E, p=0.008) and MRI evidence for contusion (univariate odds ratio 12.6, p=0.02). The only statistically significant predictor of 6- month GOS-E was combined conventional MRI and DTI evidence of any traumatic intracranial lesion (odds ratio 4.8, p=0.03). Conclusion(s): This is the first study to compare DTI features in individual MTBI patients to conventional MRI, CT, clinical, demographic and socioeconomic features for the prediction of 3- and 6-month outcome in individual patients. It is shown that conventional MRI and DTI are useful, complementary imaging biomarkers for prediction of 3- and 6-month outcome in MTBI.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,782,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445512,#23426,Yuh 2014,,yes
A comparison of outcome measures for studying prognosis in older adults: Preliminary results from a pilot prospective cohort study,Kristman V.; Reguly P.; Bedard M. ,"Objectives: Systematic reviews of outcome measures after brain injury have focused exclusively on moderate-to-severe injury or included a mixture of all severities. No study has described outcome measures after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), particularly in the older adult population. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity, specificity and responsiveness of four common outcome measures used after MTBI. Method(s): A pilot prospective cohort study was conducted with older adults who experienced a MTBI and visited an emergency department in either Thunder Bay or Kingston, Ontario. Data were collected between 5 November 2012 and 3 October 2013. Participants were contacted by phone shortly after their emergency department visit (baseline) and again 6 months later. They were administered a questionnaire including four outcome measures: the Glasgow Outcome Scale (Extended) (GOSE), the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Rivermead Post- Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) and a single question on self-rated recovery. Category cut-offs for each measure were established from previously published guidelines. This study compared the sensitivity, specificity and responsiveness using the RPQ as a comparator. For responsiveness, participants were categorized to capture change: early recovery (recovered at both baseline and 6 months), no recovery (not recovered at either time point), improvement (not recovered at baseline, recovered by 6 months) and deterioration (recovered at baseline, not recovered at 6 months). Result(s): Fifty of 89 eligible individuals agreed to participate in the study (56.2% participation rate). As of 3 October 2013, 26 of 28 had completed follow-up interviews (7.1% attrition rate). The SF-12 mental component score (MCS) had good sensitivity for identifying recovery (93.6% (95% CI=78.6%, 99.2%) and 100% (95% CI=85.2%, 100%) at baseline and 6-months, respectively), while the GOSE and self-rated question had good specificity for identifying non-recovery at baseline (GOSE: 83.3% (95% CI=58.6%, 96.4%), self-rated: 100% (95% CI=81.5%, 100%)) and 6-months post-injury (GOSE and selfrated: 100% (95% CI=29.2%, 100%)). The MCS and RPQ identified little change and greatest proportion of early recovery (73.1% and 65.4%, respectively). The GOSE and self-rated question identified two participants with deterioration. These measures also reported less early recovery (GOSE: 34.6%, self-report: 11.5%). Conclusion(s): There is no one best measure to assess recovery from MTBI in older adults. Both MTBI-specific and generic tools reported varying results. The MCS and RPQ reported little change; however, this may be due to ceiling effects. The GOSE and the PCS found similar distributions of recovery over time. The self-rated question identified the least amount of early recovery. Concepts of recovery vary among the measures. Hence, this study recommends using multiple measures of recovery to capture the differing concepts.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,813-814,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445588,#23423,Kristman 2014,,yes
Ageing population is neglected in research studies-a representative study of patients with traumatic brain injury,Longworth A.; Veenith T. ,"The UK population is ageing and by 2032 the cohort of people over 65 years is expected increase to 16.1 million. The aims of this study were: 1. To identify the national demographics of patients admitted with traumatic brain injury (TBI). 2. To assess the evolution of mortality of patients admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital neurocritical care unit (NCCU) between 2000 to 2011 3. A systematic review of literature from 1997 to 2012 to identify whether there is an age bias amongst researchers studying TBI. Methods Cambridgeshire central ethics committee considered this as non research and a waiver was issued. Patients with TBI admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital NCCU were identified and were divided into 3 age groups (<60, 60-74, -Y75 years). A group comparison evaluating changing mortality was performed using logistic regression method with hospital mortality as the binary outcome variable and year of admission and age group as exploratory variables. Statistics for TBI admissions were obtained from public domain of health episode statistics (HES) online. Systematic review of literature was performed using filters described by the Hedges Group (Figure 1). EMBASE and Medline were searched with key words craniocerebral trauma, cerebrovascular trauma, brain injuries, head injury, brain injury, nervous system injury and traumatic brain injury. Information extracted from each paper included mean age and standard deviation (SD) of patients studied, continent of study origin, category of paper (drug intervention, other intervention, prognosis or treatment strategy, recovery). Statistical analyses were conducted using Statview Version 5. All tests were two sided, and all p - values are quoted after Bonferroni corrections (where appropriate), and corrected P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results 1. National demographics of patients admitted with TBI: National TBI admissions have increased with greatest rise in >60 year age group (Friedman's test corrected P value < 0.0001, figure 1) (Figure 1). 2. Mortality of patients admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital NCCU between 2000 and 2011: 60-74 year age group has seen a significantly lower improvement in hospital mortality over time compared to the <60 age group (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31), even after adjusting for ICNARC score. 3. Systematic review of literature from 1997 to 2012: (i) The average of the mean age and standard deviation of the study populations was calculated.

Validation of the impact prognostic models,Madden L.K.; Blozis S.A.; Keachie K.; Shahlaie K.; Berman R.F.; DeVon H.A. ,"Several prognostic models have been developed for traumatic brain injury (TBI) but have limited applicability due to development from small datasets. The International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) models, derived from several clinical trial datasets, were developed for prediction of mortality versus survival or unfavorable versus favorable outcome at 6-months post-injury. In order to confirm utility across centers, external validation is necessary. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of three IMPACT models for prediction of 6-month post-injury mortality and dichotomized neurologic outcome (unfavorable/favorable) using data collected from a Level I trauma center registry. We analyzed admission data on 354 consecutive adult (>= 16 years) patients that sustained blunt TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale sum score <= 12 (moderate or severe TBI). IMPACT model predictions of mortality (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS-E] = 1) versus survival (GOS-E = 2-8) and unfavorable (GOS-E = 1-4) versus favorable outcome (GOS-E = 5-8) were compared to the actual observed classifications using logistic regression. The ability of each model to correctly assign patients to groups was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The IMPACT models performed with increasing accuracy in each more complex model. The ability to discriminate between mortality and survival was 0.85 for the Core model, 0.87 for the Extended model, and 0.87 for the Lab model in AUC analysis. The ability to discriminate between unfavorable and favorable outcomes was 0.84 for the Core model, 0.85 for the Extended model, and 0.87 for the Lab model in AUC analysis.

Evaluation of severe head injury management with hemostasis monitoring by Rotem in the trauma ICU of dijon universitary hospital: Preliminary study,Mirek S.; Darphin J.; Opprecht N.; Nadji A.; Demaistre E.; Aho S.; Girard C. ,"INTRODUCTION. Severe head trauma remains a priority in terms of public health with a high mortality and significant sequelae. Added hemostasis disorders may worsen the prognosis. They must be corrected quickly. OBJECTIVES. The objective of our study is to assess of professional practices in the management of severe TBI patients at the Universitary Hospital of Dijon and to observe the prognosis worsening factors, including hemostasis disorders. METHODS. An observational retrospective study was carried out from January 2011 to December 2013 on all patients who were hospitalized for head injuries in the ward of trauma resuscitation of the Universitary Hospital of Dijon. Epidemiological variables (age, gender), lesions (GCS), hemodynamic (MBP, pulse), time to management, use of noradrenaline, biological variables (pH, Lactate) and the coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen) were analyzed by univariate test and then introduced into a multivariate Cox model. The threshold p<0.05 was accepted as significant. The primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS. 206 patients with head injury were included from January 2011 to December 2013. A ratio of 77 % of men is found, with a mean age of 43 yo. Mean GCS is 8, with 96 patients with GCS<8 (48 %). A significant difference in survival was found for age (p = 0.020), GCS (p<0.001), noradrenaline (p<0.001), pulse (p = 0.090), PT (p<0.001), the aPTT(p<0.001) and fibrinogen (p = 0.033). Multivariate analysis found the following results (table 1). CONCLUSIONS. Population of this study is representative of TBI patients, with almost half of severe head injury (GCS<8).This work confirms the classical factors of worsening, such as age, initial GCS, the administration of noradrenaline. In addition, the hemostasis profile is particularly interesting, in particular PT and fibrinogen. We are working on the establishment of a thromboelastographic monitoring by Rotem in the trauma ICU to get in the shortest time a coagulation profile of our TBI patients. The objective is to optimize care and improve survival. This 2nd phase of the work is in progress.

The prognostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Haghbayan H.; Boutin A.; Laflamme M.; Lauzier F.; Shemilt M.; Moore L.; Zarychanski R.; Fergusson D.; Turgeon A.F. ,"INTRODUCTION. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Determining long-term prognosis is important for assisting clinical decision-making and informing substitute decision makers. However, the prediction of neurological outcome remains problematic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to evaluate structures such as the brainstem in the acute phase of TBI for neuroprognostication despite its unestablished prognostic value. We undertook a systematic review of prognostic studies on MRI performed in the acute-phase of moderate or severe TBI. OBJECTIVES. To determine the prognostic value of acute-phase structural MRI in patients with moderate or severe TBI. METHODS. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to August 2012. We included observational cohort studies of adults with moderate or severe TBI that evaluated the association of structural MRI performed within 28 days of the TBI with neurological outcome. Our primary outcomes were the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), the extended GOS (GOSe) and mortality. An unfavourable outcome was defined as a score of 1, 2 or 3 on the GOS and as a score of 1 to 4 on the GOSe. We generated summary effect estimates employing a random effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method and reported relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). We explored statistical heterogeneity with the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses planned a priori were undertaken to investigate heterogeneity and robustness of the results. RESULTS. We identified 19, 416 records and included 29 (n = 1,483) studies, of which 18 (n = 905) were eligible for meta-analysis. Brainstem lesions were significantly predictive of unfavourable GOS (9 studies, n = 465, RR = 2.77, 95 % CI 1.56 to 4.92, I2 = 86 %) and of mortality (3 studies, n = 131, RR = 2.71, 95 % CI 1.21 to 6.07, I2 = 0 %). The association of brainstem lesions with GOS was also derived through a second method by the dichotomization of two scoring systems (Firsching and Adams-Gentry) into grades of brainstem lesions vs. non-brainstem lesions (6 studies, n = 386, RR = 2.70, 95 % CI 1.79 to 4.07, I2 = 63 %). In subgroup analyses, we found that the prognostic significance of brainstem lesions was derived from lesions confined to the midbrain and pons. Bilateral symmetric lesions were associated with greater risk of unfavourable GOS compared to unilateral lesions. CONCLUSIONS. Brainstem lesions, especially lesions of the midbrain or pons and bilateral lesions, are predictors of unfavourable GOS and mortality. Further studies controlling for established and potential prognostic predictors are required to assess the additive value of acute MRI as a prognosticator for TBI.",2014,/,Intensive Care Medicine,40,1 SUPPL. 1,S202,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-3451-5,71630540,#23384,Haghbayan 2014,,yes
Predictors of outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) defined by multimodality neuromonitoring including near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),Vilke A.; Bilskiene D.; Gedminas M.; Bieliauskaite D.; Suskeviciene I.; Macas A. ,"Background and Goal of Study: Due to the heterogenic nature of TBI, it is important to define as many outcome predictors of this pathological condition. Current prognostic models are based on admission characteristics. The aim was to determine the differences of cerebral oxygenation within groups of positive and lethal outcomes, estimate their correlation with other cofactors and determine their prognostic value. Material(s) and Method(s): Data analysis from 72 h perioperative multimodality monitoring of 48 adult TBI patients who underwent surgery was made. NIRS data and basic parameters were monitored. Clinical data and functional outcomes were obtained. Statistical methods of one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation and Cox regression were used to determine the associations and prognostic value. Results were deemed significant when p< 0.05. Results and discussion: 15 women and 33 men with age mean of 54.2+/-8.5 years were enrolled into the prospective study. There were 15 lethal outcomes. Left hemisphere rSO2 (rSO2L) values were significantly higher in the survival group, with biggest difference in the period after extubation (79.2+/-4.9 vs 60.2+/-9,7; p< 0.000). Right hemisphere rSO2 (rSO2R) values, particularly before and right after operation, correlated well with Barthel index (r=0.677; p=0.004 and r=0.683; p=0.003). Pre- and intraoperative rSO2 values were higher in male population (83.2+/-4.5 vs 71.4+/-8.1; p=0.005). Group of lethal outcomes had significant differences in primary GCS score (5.7+/-1.5 vs 11.0+/-2.3; p< 0.000), hemoglobin (116.4+/-13.4 vs 132.9+/-7.8; p=0.011), blood glucose (9.0+/-1.5 vs 6.8+/-0.8; p=0.003), urea (6.09+/-0.98 vs 4.52+/-0.96; p=0.021), PTT (35.9+/-3.6 vs 31.9+/-1.8; p=0.011) and other variables. With minimised entrophy, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated groups with primary GCS score below 10 and blood glucose level above 9mmol/l to have poorer survivability (Mantel-Cox X2=10.4; p=0.001 and Mantel-Cox X2=13.0; p< 0.000). Cox regression indicated primary GCS score and blood glucose level as strongest predictors of survivability when combined in a model (R2=0.77 and R2=1.32; p=0.000). Conclusion(s): The study showed association between rSO2L and survivability, but rSO2R correlated better with functional outcome, regardless of the lesion location. The sample was too small to include rSO2 in a prognostic model with other cofactors. Many other variables are related to outcome after TBI, but future studies are needed for novel prognostic models introduction.",2014,/,European Journal of Anaesthesiology,31,SUPPL. 52,117,,,71638185,#23382,Vilke 2014,,yes
Prognostic factors following mild traumatic brain injury in older adults,Kristman V.L.; Reguly P.; Brison R.; Bedard M.; Chisholm S. ,"Objective: To identify modifiable prognostic factors associated with poor recovery from mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in older adults. Design(s): Pilot prospective cohort study. Setting(s): Three Ontario general hospitals. Participant(s): Patients aged 65 and older that visited an emergency department (ED) for MTBI. Intervention(s): N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Recovery from MTBI was assessed using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) and a single question on self-rated recovery. Measures were assessed by telephone shortly after ED visits (baseline) and six months after ED visits. Predictors were measured at baseline. Chi-square analyses were performed to determine odds ratio point estimates. Result(s): At baseline, 53 people were enrolled. As of March 2014, 40 of 44 participants had completed follow-up. Modifiable factors associated with poor recovery according to the RPQ were depression (11.6 (95% CI: 1.1, 117.5)) and worse health compared to one year ago (11.6 (95% CI: 1.1, 117.5)). High fatigue was the only factor associated with poor recovery according to self-rated recovery question (14.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 167.4)). For several factors related to pain, injury severity, overall health, and outlook on health, we observed trends suggesting prognostic potential for poor recovery according to both measures; however, the associations were not statistically significant due to small sample size. Conclusion(s): Modifiable prognostic factors for poor recovery after MTBI among older adults included depression, fatigue, and deteriorating health. These factors could be targeted by interventions to promote early recovery after MTBI; however, further confirmatory longitudinal research is needed to verify this hypothesis.",2014,/,Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,95,10,e69,,,71665747,#23375,Kristman 2014,,yes
ABCG2 RS2231142 C.421C>A is associated with outcomes following severe traumatic brain injury,Adams S.; Conley Y.; Okonkwo D.; Puccio A.; Clark R.; Dixon E.; Kochanek P.; Empey P. ,"Learning Objectives: The ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) is a potential target for traumatic brain injury (TBI) prognostication and treatment as it plays critical roles in blood-brain barrier function, mitigation of hypoxia-driven protoporphyrin IX toxicity, and regulation of endogenous antioxidant levels. We hypothesized that rs2231142 c.421C>A, a decreased function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ABCG2 gene, may serve as a predictor of poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Method(s): Adult Caucasian severe TBI patients (n=273; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <= 8) were genotyped for the SNP rs2231142 c.421C>A. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were evaluated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury, dichotomized to favorable (4, 5) or unfavorable (1, 2, 3) outcome, and compared with a dominant variant allele model using multivariate logistic regression to control for initial GCS score, age, and sex. Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores were also collected and compared utilizing a linear regression model. Result(s): ABCG2 genotyping had a call rate of 89% and adhered to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 83.6% of subjects had the wild-type CC genotype, 16.4% had the CA genotype, and no subjects were homozygous for the variant allele. Multivariate analyses for GOS scores showed patients in the variant group (CA genotype) had significantly higher odds of being assigned a favorable outcome at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (OR:3.96, 2.75, 2.47, and 3.75, respectively; all p<0.05). Similar findings were found with the DRS scores at each time point (all p<0.05). Conclusion(s): We identified an association of ABCG2 rs2231142 c.421C>A (CA genotype) with favorable GOS and DRS at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury. ABCG2 appears to have an important role on the secondary injury response and/or the effects of therapy in patients with severe TBI. Understanding this process could lead to novel insight into secondary injury or optimized therapy for TBI. Further research will seek to replicate and understand the mechanism behind this finding.",2014,/,Critical Care Medicine,42,12 SUPPL. 1,A1484,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000458013.00293.ae,71707223,#23367,Adams 2014,,yes
Change in plasma visfatin level after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Chen, Jun; Weng, Jian-Feng; Hong, Wei-Cong; Luo, Li-Feng; Yu, Wei; Luo, Shi-Da","Higher plasma visfatin concentration has been associated with ischemic stroke. Thus, we sought to investigate change in plasma visfatin level after traumatic brain injury and to evaluate its relation with disease outcome. Seventy-six healthy controls and 98 patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were recruited. Twenty-seven patients (27.6%) died and 48 patients (49.0%) suffered from unfavorable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3) in 6 months. On admission, plasma visfatin level was increased in patients than in healthy controls and was highly correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale score. A multivariate analysis identified plasma visfatin level as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the predictive value of the plasma visfatin concentration was similar to Glasgow Coma Scale score's. In a combined logistic-regression model, visfatin did not improve the predictive value of Glasgow Coma Scale score. Thus, increased plasma visfatin level is associated with 6-month clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammasome proteins in cerebrospinal fluid of brain-injured patients as biomarkers of functional outcome: clinical article.,"Adamczak, Stephanie; Dale, Gordon; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo; Bullock, M Ross; Dietrich, W Dalton; Keane, Robert W","OBJECT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), the third most common CNS pathology, plagues 5.3 million Americans with permanent TBI-related disabilities. To evaluate injury severity and prognosis, physicians rely on clinical variables. Here, the authors seek objective, biochemical markers reflecting molecular injury mechanisms specific to the CNS as more accurate measurements of injury severity and outcome. One such secondary injury mechanism, the innate immune response, is regulated by the inflammasome, a molecular platform that activates caspase-1 and interleukin-1beta., METHODS: The authors investigated whether inflammasome components were present in the CSF of 23 patients with TBI and whether levels of inflammasome components correlate with outcome. The authors performed an immunoblot analysis of CSF samples from patients who suffered TBI and nontrauma controls and assessed the outcomes 5 months postinjury by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-tests and linear regression analysis., RESULTS: Patients with severe or moderate cranial trauma exhibited significantly higher CSF levels of the inflammasome proteins ASC, caspase-1, and NALP-1 than nontrauma controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0029, and p = 0.0202, respectively). Expression of each protein correlated significantly with the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 5 months postinjury (p < 0.05). ASC, caspase-1, and NALP-1 were significantly higher in the CSF of patients with unfavorable outcomes, including death and severe disability (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: NALP-1 inflammasome proteins are potential biomarkers to assess TBI severity, outcome, and the secondary injury mechanisms impeding recovery, serving as adjuncts to clinical predictors.",2012,/,Journal of neurosurgery,117,6,1119-25,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2012.9.JNS12815,23061392,#8617,Adamczak 2012,,yes

Introduction of a novel trauma score.,"Hoffmann, Michael; Lehmann, Wolfgang; Rueger, Johannes M; Lefering, Rolf; Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery","BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and reliable prediction of outcome are essential for determining treatment strategies and allocating resources. This study introduces the Eppendorf-Cologne Scale (ECS) and evaluated its predictive accuracy for outcome and TBI presence compared with those of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)., METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of severely injured trauma patients registered in the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery from 1993 to 2010 was conducted. Only directly admitted patients alive on admission and with complete data on GCS, pupil reactivity, and size were included. The ECS was modeled using pupil reactivity, size, and a modified GCS motor component. The unadjusted predictive role of each component was evaluated using multivariable regression analysis. The predictive power regarding the presence of TBI and outcome of the ECS and the GCS was modeled using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses., RESULTS: A total of 28,305 patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. The ECS outmatched the predictive accuracy of the GCS for outcome (AUROC, 0.824; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.817-0.831; and AUROC, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.804-0.818, respectively; rs = 0.887, p < 0.001) and TBI presence (AUROC, 0.813; 95% CI, 0.805-0.822; and AUROC, 0.777; 95% CI, 0.768-0.786, respectively; rs = 0.889, p < 0.001). Patients with TBI were five times more often unconscious at the scene and showed a 3.5-fold increased in-hospital mortality. An ECS score of 8 was associated with a 20-fold higher mortality compared with an ECS score of 0. The ECS differentiates patients with a fourfold higher mortality within the GCS 3 collective., CONCLUSION: The ECS shows a significantly higher accuracy for prediction of outcome and TBI presence compared with the GCS and provides a simple, yet reliable, stratification tool for early decision making., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study, level III.",2012,/,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,73,6,1607-13,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e318270d572,23188250,#8592,Hoffmann 2012,,yes
"Factors influencing the immediate postoperative outcome in operated head injured patients in Ibadan, Nigeria.","Adigun, T A; Adeolu, A A","INTRODUCTION: The injured brain is subjected to anaesthetic agents and various intravenous fluids which may exacerbate haemodynamic instability, increase cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure., OBJECTIVE: The study examined factors that influenced the immediate postoperative outcome in head injured patients who underwent general anaesthesia in a tertiary health care facility., METHODS: The demographic and outcome data of all head injured patients who had neurosurgical procedures under general anaesthesia in our centre between January and December 2010 were compiled prospectively. Outcome was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), good outcome was defined as an improvement in the GCS/recovery while poor outcome as worsening of GCS / mortality post operatively. The data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 and p value was set at 0.05., RESULTS: Ninety nine patients were recruited. The patients' median age was 37.0 years and 81.8% were males. The most affected age group was 17-49 years. Indications for surgery were compound depressed skull fracture 28.3%, intracerebral haematoma 17.2%, subdural 35.4% and extradural haematoma 13.1% and impacted intracranial foreign body 6%. Eighty six percent of the patients had their head injury following road traffic accident. Fatality rate was 16.2%. Outcome was poor in patients with severe head injury (13%) compared with patients with mild (1.1%) and moderate head injury (2%) p = 0.001, and poor in American Society of Anaesthesiologist's (ASA) 3 (9%) and 4 (6%) classification compared to ASA 2 (1%) (p = 0.0069). Outcome was also poor in patients with intracerebral haematoma (9%) and acute subdural haematoma (2%) compared to that of depressed skull fracture (1%) (P=0.002) and in patients with intraoperative hypotension (13.1%) compared with those with normal blood pressure (1%) (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Road traffic accident is the leading cause of head injury, increasing ASA, decreasing GCS, type of cranial lesion and intraoperative hypotension are some of the factors affecting outcome in operated head injuries.

S100B Protein as a Post-traumatic Biomarker for Prediction of Brain Death in Association With Patient Outcomes.,"Shakeri, Moslem; Mahdkhah, Atta; Panahi, Farid","BACKGROUND: S100B is a calcium-binding protein, belonging to the S100 family proteins which are characterized by their high solubility and, currently, comprises 21 members which are expressed in a cell-specific manner. If we can predict the possibility of definite brain death after brain injury, we will rescue some organs of body to transplant proposes., OBJECTIVES: In this regard our study focused on the S100B protein value in predicting brain death after head trauma. In this study, the use of serum level of protein S100, 24 hours after trauma has been considered as a reliable index for predicting brain death., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 72 patients (50 male and 22 female) aged 5 - 80 years old (median 40 +/- 17.72 years) with severe head traumas (GCS<=8) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and computed tomography (CT) scan findings were recorded for all patients, and then a single 5mL blood sample was obtained from each patient on admission, after 48 hours and a week later or after brain death to determine the level of S100B protein., RESULTS: Primary and the last GCS of patients had a predictive value in determining brain death (P < 0.0005), also there was a significant correlation between GCS and level of S100B protein. There was a significant correlation between CT scan findings and S100B protein only after 48 hours of trauma., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in S100B protein, especially the levels of this dimer 48 hours after trauma can be used as marker to predict brain death. Alongside other known prognostic factors such as age, GCS and diameters of the pupils, however, this factor individually can not conclusive predict the patient's clinical course and incidence of brain death. However, it is suitable to use GCS, CT scan, clinical symptoms and biomarkers together for a perfect prediction of brain death.",2013,/,Archives of trauma research,2,2,76-80,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5812/atr.8549,24396798,#8566,Shakeri 2013,,yes

The patients were divided into two subgroups according to age : a junior elderly group 55 to 64 years old and a senior elderly group over the age of 65. NOs and FO were evaluated using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery and Clinical Dementia Rating scale., RESULTS: Gender, age, and education level were shown to significantly impact the recovery of NOs after TBI. Other DVs and CVs such as area of residency, occupation, type of injury, or loss of consciousness were not found to significantly affect the recovery of NOs after TBI. Analysis of the relationships among DVs, CVs and NOs demonstrated that gender, age, and education level contributed to the variance of NOs. In FO, loss of consciousness (LOC) was included to prognostic factor., CONCLUSION: Gender, age and education level significantly influence the NOs of elderly patients with TBI. LOC may also serve as a meaningful prognostic factor in FO.

Effects of brain contusion on mild traumatic brain-injured patients.,"Zare, Mohammad Amin; Ahmadi, Koorosh; Zadegan, Shayan Abdollah; Farsi, Davood; Rahimi-Movaghar, Vafa","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important health issue with high prevalence. The most common type of TBI is mild TBI (MTBI). MTBI is known as a condition with self-limited symptoms; however, it could cause some structural abnormalities of brain and become complicated. Visible structural brain damage could have an important effect on recovery after MTBI, but the outcome is not fully understood. This study investigated the clinical course of MTBI patients with the existence of contusion in computed tomography (CT) imaging. Fifty patients with MTBI and simultaneous brain contusion in CT scan were enrolled according to specific exclusion criteria in 14 month. Patients were followed up for two weeks after their first arrival for neurosurgical interventions, decreased level of consciousness, and other neurological complications. Presence of neurological symptoms increased duration of hospital stay and number of CT scans. Forty-two percent of MTBI patients with contusion did not have any objective neurological signs. Fifty percent returned to the hospital with neurologic symptoms and signs. Leading causes were headache followed by seizure and dizziness. Rehospitalization was increased in the patients with altered level of consciousness. The size of brain contusion increased in two patients without further need for neurosurgical intervention.

[Utility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in severe focal traumatic brain injuries].,"Prieto-Valderrey, F; Muniz-Montes, J R; Lopez-Garcia, J A; Villegas-Del Ojo, J; Malaga-Gil, J; Galvan-Garcia, R","OBJECTIVE: To describe the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in a series of severe traumatic brain injuries, their clinical and outcome features, and possible implications., DESIGN: A descriptive, observational case-series study was carried out., PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients with severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) admitted to the ICU were subjected to MRI study using a 1.5 T scanner. Diffusion-weighted images (DWMR) were obtained using the following echo-planar pulse sequence: TR 10000 ms, TE 126.9 ms, with b values 1000 s/mm2 in the three spatial dimensions. Combining the three sets of images, an isotropic image conforming a map of the mean ADCs was obtained., RESULTS: DWMR was performed in 23 patients with severe TBI admitted to the ICU between 2001 and 2004. In the MR images we selected 26 regions of interest (ROIs) where ADC was recorded. We observed a clear increase in diffusion in non-treated space-occupying lesions versus other types of injuries and the normal values. A poorer outcome was recorded in patients with lower ADC values., CONCLUSIONS: Mean ADC in the lesions was greater than the normal values and greater in contusions than in other types of injuries, as an expression of extracellular edema. ADCs were decreased in patients with a poor outcome, suggesting an association between ischemia and the patient prognosis. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC.

Intensive care and traumatic brain injury after the introduction of a treatment protocol: a prospective study.,"Schirmer-Mikalsen, K; Moen, K G; Skandsen, T; Vik, A; Klepstad, P","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome., METHODS: During a 5-year period (2004-2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <= 8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months., RESULTS: The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%.

Novel methods to predict increased intracranial pressure during intensive care and long-term neurologic outcome after traumatic brain injury: development and validation in a multicenter dataset.,"Guiza, Fabian; Depreitere, Bart; Piper, Ian; Van den Berghe, Greet; Meyfroidt, Geert","OBJECTIVE: Intracranial pressure monitoring is standard of care after severe traumatic brain injury. Episodes of increased intracranial pressure are secondary injuries associated with poor outcome. We developed a model to predict increased intracranial pressure episodes 30 mins in advance, by using the dynamic characteristics of continuous intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring. In addition, we hypothesized that performance of current models to predict long-term neurologic outcome could be substantially improved by adding dynamic characteristics of continuous intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring during the first 24 hrs in the ICU., DESIGN: Prognostic modeling. Noninterventional, observational, retrospective study., SETTING AND PATIENTS: The Brain Monitoring with Information Technology dataset consisted of 264 traumatic brain injury patients admitted to 22 neuro-ICUs from 11 European countries., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS: Predictive models were built with multivariate logistic regression and Gaussian processes, a machine learning technique. Predictive attributes were Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury-basic and International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trial design in TBI-core predictors, together with time-series summary statistics of minute-by-minute mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure., MAIN RESULTS: Increased intracranial pressure episodes could be predicted 30 mins ahead with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value 0.12, calibration slope 1.02, calibration-in-the-large -0.02) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87) on an external validation dataset. Models for prediction of poor neurologic outcome at six months (Glasgow Outcome Score 1-2) based only on static admission data had 0.72 area under the receiver operating curve; adding dynamic information of intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure during the first 24 hrs increased performance to 0.90. Similarly, prediction of Glasgow Outcome Score 1-3 was improved from 0.68 to 0.87 when including dynamic information., CONCLUSION: The dynamic information in continuous mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure monitoring allows to accurately predict increased intracranial pressure in the neuro-ICU. Adding information of the first 24 hrs of intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring to known baseline risk factors allows very accurate prediction of long-term neurologic outcome at 6 months.",2013,/,Critical care medicine,41,2,554-64,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182742d0a,23263587,#8433,Guiza 2013,,yes
Examination of outcome after mild traumatic brain injury: the contribution of injury beliefs and Leventhal's common sense model.,"Snell, Deborah L; Hay-Smith, E Jean C; Surgenor, Lois J; Siegert, Richard J","Associations between components of Leventhal's common sense model of health behaviour (injury beliefs, coping, distress) and outcome after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) were examined. Participants (n = 147) were recruited within three months following MTBI and assessed six months later, completing study questionnaires at both visits (Illness Perceptions Questionnaire Revised, Brief COPE, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Outcome measures included the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and Rivermead Head Injury Follow-Up Questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses examined associations between injury beliefs, coping and distress at baseline, and later outcome. Participants endorsing stronger injury identity beliefs (p < .01), expectations of lasting severe consequences (p < .01), and distress (p < .01) at time one, had greater odds of poor outcome at time two. Coping styles were also associated with later outcome although variability in findings limited interpretability. Associations between psychological variables and outcome were examined and 76.5% of cases were correctly classified by the model. Consistent with Leventhal's model, participant beliefs about their injury and recovery had significant associations with outcome over time. Coping also appeared to have important associations with outcome but more research is required to examine these.

Prognosis in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: external validation of the IMPACT models and the role of extracranial injuries.,"Lingsma, Hester; Andriessen, Teuntje M J C; Haitsema, Iain; Horn, Janneke; van der Naalt, Joukje; Franschman, Gaby; Maas, Andrew I R; Vos, Pieter E; Steyerberg, Ewout W","BACKGROUND: Several prognostic models to predict outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been developed, but few are externally validated. We aimed to validate the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic models in a recent unselected patient cohort and to assess the additional prognostic value of extracranial injury., METHODS: The Prospective Observational COhort Neurotrauma (POCON) registry contains 508 patients with moderate or severe TBI, who were admitted in 2008 and 2009 to five trauma centers in the Netherlands. We predicted the probability of mortality and unfavorable outcome at 6 months after injury with the IMPACT prognostic models. We studied discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]) and calibration. We added the extracranial component of the Injury Severity Score (ISS) to the models and calculated the increase in AUC., RESULTS: The IMPACT models had an adequate discrimination in the POCON registry, with AUCs in the external validation between 0.85 and 0.90 for mortality and between 0.82 and 0.87 for unfavorable outcome. Observed outcomes agreed well with predicted outcomes. Adding extracranial injury slightly improved predictions in the overall population (unfavorable outcome: AUC increase of 0.002, p = 0.02; mortality: AUC increase of 0.000, p = 0.37) but more clearly in patients with moderate TBI (unfavorable outcome: AUC increase of 0.008, p < 0.01, mortality: AUC increase of 0.012, p = 0.02) and patients with minor computed tomographic result abnormalities (unfavorable outcome: AUC increase of 0.013, p < 0.01; mortality: AUC increase of 0.001, p = 0.08)., CONCLUSION: The IMPACT models performed well in a recent series of TBI patients.

Predictive value of neuromarkers supported by a set of clinical criteria in patients with mild traumatic brain injury: S100B protein and neuron-specific enolase on trial: clinical article.,"Wolf, Harald; Frantal, Sophie; Pajenda, Gholam S; Salameh, Olivia; Widhalm, Harald; Hajdu, Stefan; Sarahrudi, Kambiz","OBJECT: The role of the neuromarkers S100B protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in minor head injury is well established. Moreover, there are sensitive decision rules available in the literature to identify clinically important brain lesions. However, it is not clear if using the biomarkers has an influence on the predictability of the decision rule. The purpose of this study was to determine if a set of preclinical and clinical parameters combined with 2 neuromarker levels could serve as reliable guidance for accurate diagnosis., METHODS: Prospective evaluation of a cohort of head trauma patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 13-15 was performed at an academic, Level I trauma center. Blood samples and cranial CT studies were obtained for all patients within 3 hours after injury. The hypothesis of the study was whether the combination of an increase of S100B and NSE levels in serum and other defined risk factors are associated with a pathological finding on CT. A forward stepwise logistic regression model was used., RESULTS: The study included 107 head trauma patients with a mean age of 59 +/- 23 years. Twenty-five patients (23.4%) had traumatic lesions on CT. Eight patients underwent craniotomy. The analysis provided a model with good overall accuracy for discriminating cases with clinically important brain injury, including the 6 variables of S100B, NSE, nausea, amnesia, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88 (0.83-0.93). The receiver operating characteristic curve plots detecting clinically important brain injury for the single variables of S100B and NSE showed an AUC of 0.63 and 0.64, respectively. Conclusions The integration of the neuromarker panel as part of a diagnostic rule including the high-risk factors of nausea, vomiting, amnesia, and loss of consciousness is safe and reliable in determining a diagnosis, pending the availability of more brain-specific neuromarkers.

Should uncooperative trauma patients with suspected head injury be intubated?.,"Garcia, Arturo; Yeung, Louise Y; Miraflor, Emily J; Victorino, Gregory P","In trauma patients with a suspicion for traumatic brain injury (TBI), a head computed tomography (CT) scan is imperative. However, uncooperative patients often cannot undergo imaging without sedation and may need to be intubated. Our hypothesis was that among mildly injured trauma patients, in whom there is a suspicion of a head injury, uncooperative patients have higher rates of TBI and intubation should be considered to obtain a CT scan. We found that uncooperative patients intubated for diagnostic purposes were more likely to have moderate to severe TBI than nonintubated patients (21.4 vs. 8.4%, P < 0.0001) and uncooperative behavior leading to intubation was an independent predictor of TBI (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.5). Of patients with brain injury, intubated patients more often had a head abbreviated injury scale score of 4 (20.8 vs. 7.9%, P = 0.04). Uncooperative intubated patients had longer hospital stays (3.6 vs. 2.6 days, P = 0.003) and higher mortality (0.9 vs. 0.2%, P = 0.02) than nonintubated patients. Uncooperative behavior may be an early warning sign of TBI and the trauma surgeon should consider intubating uncooperative trauma patients if there is suspicion for brain injury based on the mechanism of their trauma.",2013,/,The American surgeon,79,3,313-20,,,23461960,#8343,Garcia 2013,,yes
Impact of concomitant injuries on outcomes after traumatic brain injury.,"Leitgeb, Johannes; Mauritz, Walter; Brazinova, Alexandra; Majdan, Marek; Wilbacher, Ingrid","BACKGROUND: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently have concomitant injuries; we aimed to investigate their impact on outcomes., METHODS: Between February 2002 and April 2010, 17 Austrian centers prospectively enrolled 863 patients with moderate and severe TBI into observational studies. Data on accident, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Patients who survived until intensive care unit (ICU) admission and had survivable TBI were selected, and were assigned to ""isolated TBI"" or ""TBI + injury"" groups. Six-month outcomes were classified as ""favorable"" if Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were five or four, and were classified as ""unfavorable"" if GOS scores were three or less. Univariate statistics (Fisher's exact test, t test, chi(2)-test) and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with hospital mortality and unfavorable outcome., RESULTS: Of the 767 patients, 403 (52.5 %) had isolated TBI, 364 (47.5 %) had concomitant injuries. Patients with isolated TBI had higher mean age (53 vs. 44 years, P = 0.001); hospital mortality (30.0 vs. 27.2 %, P = 0.42) and rate of unfavorable outcome (50.4 vs. 41.8 %, P = 0.02) were higher, too. There were no significant mortality differences for factors like age groups, trauma mechanisms, neurologic status, CT findings, or treatment factors. Concomitant injuries were associated with higher mortality (33.3 vs. 12.5 %, P = 0.05) in patients with moderate TBI, and were significantly associated with more ventilation, ICU, and hospitals days. Logistic regression revealed that age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupillary reactivity, severity of TBI and CT score were the main factors that influenced outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant injuries have a significant effect upon the mortality of patients with moderate TBI.

Increased plasma 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha concentration in severe human traumatic brain injury.,"Yu, Guo-Feng; Jie, Yuan-Qing; Wu, An; Huang, Qiang; Dai, Wei-Min; Fan, Xiao-Feng","BACKGROUND: 8-Iso-Prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) is considered as a gold standard for measuring oxidative stress in vivo. The present study was undertaken to investigate plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha concentrations in severe human traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to analyze its correlation with disease outcome., METHODS: One hundred six healthy subjects and 106 severe TBI patients were recruited. The correlations of plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha concentration with 1-year mortality and unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) were analyzed., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (29.2%) died and 48 patients (45.3%) had an unfavorable outcome at 1 year after TBI. Patients had significantly higher plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels compared to healthy controls (572.1+/-157.5 pg/ml vs. 84.3+/-18.9 pg/ml, P<0.001). A multivariate analysis selected plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha level as an independent predictor for 1-year unfavorable outcome [odds ratio (OR) 1.401, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.107-2.371, P=0.005] and mortality (OR 1.609, 95% CI 1.113-3.142, P=0.003). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha level predicted 1-year unfavorable outcome [area under curve (AUC), 0.871; 95% CI, 0.792-0.928] and mortality (AUC, 0.881; 95% CI, 0.804-0.936) as statistically significantly. The prognostic value of 8-iso-PGF2alpha was similar to that of Glasgow Coma Scale score for 1-year clinical outcomes (both P>0.05). However, 8-iso-PGF2alpha did not improve the prognostic value of Glasgow Coma Scale score for 1-year clinical outcomes (both P>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha level is highly associated with 1-year clinical outcomes of TBI.

"Population-based, inception cohort study of the incidence, course, and prognosis of mild traumatic brain injury after motor vehicle collisions.","Cassidy, J David; Boyle, Eleanor; Carroll, Linda J","OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, course, and prognosis of adult mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) caused by motor vehicle collisions., DESIGN: Prospective, population-based, inception cohort study., SETTING: The province of Saskatchewan, Canada, with a population of about 1,000,000 inhabitants., PARTICIPANTS: All adults (N=1716) incurring an MTBI in a motor vehicle collision between November 1997 and December 1999 in Saskatchewan., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-stratified incidence rates, time to self-reported recovery, and prognostic factors over a 1-year follow-up., RESULTS: Of 7170 adults injured in a motor vehicle collision over the 2-year inception period, 1716 (24%) met our cohort definition of MTBI. There were more women affected (53%), and MTBI was most common in the 18- to 23-year-old group. Most were not hospitalized (73%), but 28% reported loss of consciousness and 23% reported posttraumatic amnesia. The annual incidence of MTBI per 100,000 adults was 106.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 98.9-113.6) in the first year and 118.3 (95% CI, 110.8-126.3) in the second year of the study. The 1-year follow-up rate was 84%. The median time to recovery was 100 days (95% CI, 97-103), and about 23% reported not having recovered by 1 year. Factors associated with delayed recovery included being older than 50 years, having less than a high school education, having poor expectations for recovery, having depressive symptoms, having arm numbness, having hearing problems, having headaches, having low back pain, and having thoracic back pain. Loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia were not associated with recovery., CONCLUSIONS: MTBI affects almost a quarter of persons reporting an injury after a traffic collision. The median time to recovery is 100 days, but 23% have still not recovered by 1 year. A mix of biopsychosocial factors is associated with recovery, including a strong effect of poor expectations for recovery. Copyright Â© 2014 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Validation of the CRASH model in the prediction of 18-month mortality and unfavorable outcome in severe traumatic brain injury requiring decompressive craniectomy.,"Honeybul, Stephen; Ho, Kwok M; Lind, Christopher R P; Gillett, Grant R","OBJECT: The goal in this study was to assess the validity of the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) collaborators prediction model in predicting mortality and unfavorable outcome at 18 months in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring decompressive craniectomy. In addition, the authors aimed to assess whether this model was well calibrated in predicting outcome across a wide spectrum of severity of TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy., METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included all patients who underwent a decompressive craniectomy following severe TBI at the two major trauma hospitals in Western Australia between 2004 and 2012 and for whom 18-month follow-up data were available. Clinical and radiological data on initial presentation were entered into the Web-based model and the predicted outcome was compared with the observed outcome. In validating the CRASH model, the authors used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to assess the ability of the CRASH model to differentiate between favorable and unfavorable outcomes., RESULTS: The ability of the CRASH 6-month unfavorable prediction model to differentiate between unfavorable and favorable outcomes at 18 months after decompressive craniectomy was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90). However, the model's calibration was not perfect. The slope and the intercept of the calibration curve were 1.66 (SE 0.21) and -1.11 (SE 0.14), respectively, suggesting that the predicted risks of unfavorable outcomes were not sufficiently extreme or different across different risk strata and were systematically too high (or overly pessimistic), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The CRASH collaborators prediction model can be used as a surrogate index of injury severity to stratify patients according to injury severity. However, clinical decisions should not be based solely on the predicted risks derived from the model, because the number of patients in each predicted risk stratum was still relatively small and hence the results were relatively imprecise.

Fever burden is an independent predictor for prognosis of traumatic brain injury.,"Bao, Long; Chen, Du; Ding, Li; Ling, Weihua; Xu, Feng","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fever burden as an independent predictor for prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: This retrospective study involved 355 TBI patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <=14, who presented at the emergency department of our hospital between November 2010 and October 2012. At 6 months follow-up, patients were divided into 5 groups based on Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and dichotomized to GOS score (high (4 to 5) vs. low (1 to 3)). The relationship between fever burden and GOS was assessed., RESULTS: Fever burden increased as GOS scores decreased from 5 to 2, except for score 1 of GOS, which corresponded to a significant lower fever burden. Following dichotomization, patients in the high GOS group were younger, and showed less abnormal pupil reactivity (P<0.001), a higher median GCS score (P<0.001), and a lower median fever burden (P<0.001), compared with patients in the low GOS group. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that poor TBI prognosis was related to age, GCS, pupil reactivity, and fever burden (OR: 1.166 [95% CI: 1.117-1.217] P<0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified fever burden as an independent predictor of poor prognosis after TBI (OR 1.098; 95% CI: 1.031-1.169; P = 0.003). These observations were confirmed by evaluation of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for fever burden (area under the curve [AUC] 0.73 [95% CI: 0.663-0.760])., CONCLUSION: Fever burden might be an independent predictor for prognosis of TBI.

The role of cell-free DNA measured by a fluorescent test in the management of isolated traumatic head injuries.,"Shaked, Gad; Douvdevani, Amos; Yair, Silvia; Zlotnik, Alexander; Czeiger, David","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. In this study a new method to measure cell free DNA (CFD) for the management of TBI is tested. Our hypothesis was that CFD concentrations correlate to the magnitude of brain damage, and may predict the outcome of injured patients., METHODS: Twenty eight patients with isolated head injury were enrolled. Their demographic and clinical data were recorded. CFD levels were determined in patients' sera samples by a direct fluorescence method developed in our laboratory., RESULTS: Mean admission CFD values were lower in patients with mild TBI compared to severe injury (760 +/- 340 ng/ml vs. 1600 +/- 2100 ng/ml, p = 0.03), and in patients with complete recovery upon discharge compared to patients with disabilities (680 +/- 260 ng/ml vs. 2000 +/- 2300 ng/ml, p = 0.003). Patients with high CFD values had a relative risk to require surgery of 1.5 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.9) a relative risk to have impaired outcome on discharge of 2.8 (95% CI 0.75 - 10), and a longer length of stay (12 +/- 13 days vs. 3.4 +/- 4.8 days, p = 0.02).

Serum albumin and prealbumin predict the poor outcome of traumatic brain injury.,"Chen, Du; Bao, Long; Lu, Shi-qi; Xu, Feng","BACKGROUND: Serum albumin and prealbumin are both negative acute-phase reactants, and usually at low levels in stress. We aim to determine their predictive values for poor outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A total of 326 patients of TBI were enrolled and followed-up by telephone 6 months after discharge. They were divided into a favorable group (GOS: 3 to 5) and an unfavorable group (GOS: 1 to 2). Serum albumin and prealbumin were measured from vein blood within 24 h after admission., RESULTS: Ninety one (27.9%) patients were with poor outcome (GOS: 1 to 2). The unfavorable group had lower albumin and prealbumin (P<0.001). Albumin and prealbumin were both positively correlated with GCS (r = 0.489, P<0.001; r = 0.222, P<0.001, respectively) and GOS (r = 0.518, P<0.001; r = 0.314, P<0.001, respectively).

Plasma levels of adrenomedullin in patients with traumatic brain injury: potential contribution to prognosis.,"Chen, Tie-Jiang; Fu, Qing-Yang; Wu, Wu-Quan","High plasma levels of adrenomedullin have been associated with stroke severity and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to analyze plasma levels of adrenomedullin in traumatic brain injury and their association with prognosis. One hundred and forty-eight acute severe traumatic brain injury and 148 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited in this study. Plasma adrenomedullin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3. Compared to controls, the patients had significantly higher plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin, which were also highly associated negatively with Glasgow Coma Scale score. Plasma adrenomedullin level was proved to be an independent predictor for 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome of patients in a multivariate analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was configured to show that a baseline plasma adrenomedullin level predicted 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome of patients with high area under curve. The predictive performance of the plasma adrenomedullin concentration was also similar to that of Glasgow Coma Scale score for the prediction of 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome of patients. In a combined logistic-regression model, adrenomedullin improved the area under curve of Glasgow Coma Scale score for the prediction of 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome of patients, but the differences did not appear to be statistically significant. Thus, high plasma levels of adrenomedullin are associated with head trauma severity, and may independently predict long-term clinical outcomes of traumatic brain injury.

Severe leukoaraiosis portends a poor outcome after traumatic brain injury.,"Henninger, Nils; Izzy, Saef; Carandang, Raphael; Hall, Wiley; Muehlschlegel, Susanne","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is now well accepted that traumatic white matter injury constitutes a critical determinant of post-traumatic functional impairment. However, the contribution of preexisting white matter rarefaction on outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown. Hence, we sought to determine whether the burden of preexisting leukoaraiosis of presumed ischemic origin is independently associated with outcome after TBI., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients of >=50 years (n = 136) who were admitted to a single neurological/trauma intensive care unit. Supratentorial white matter hypoattenuation on head CT was graded on a 5-point scale (range 0-4) reflecting increasing severity of leukoaraiosis. Outcome was ascertained according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) at 3 and 12 months, respectively., RESULTS: After adjustment for other factors, leukoaraiosis severity was significantly associated with a poor outcome at 3 and 12 months defined as mRS 3-6 and GOS 1-3, respectively. The independent association between leukoaraiosis and poor outcome remained when the analysis was restricted to patients who survived up to 3 months, had moderate-to-severe TBI [enrollment Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <=12; p = 0.001], or had mild TBI (GCS 13-15; p = 0.002), respectively., CONCLUSION: We provide first evidence that preexisting cerebral small vessel disease independently predicts a poor functional outcome after closed head TBI. This association is independent of other established outcome predictors such as age, comorbid state as well as intensive care unit complications and interventions.

Functional recovery after moderate/severe traumatic brain injury: a role for cognitive reserve?.,"Schneider, Eric B; Sur, Sandeepa; Raymont, Vanessa; Duckworth, Josh; Kowalski, Robert G; Efron, David T; Hui, Xuan; Selvarajah, Shalini; Hambridge, Hali L; Stevens, Robert D","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that educational attainment, a marker of cognitive reserve, is a predictor of disability-free recovery (DFR) after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: Retrospective study of the TBI Model Systems Database, a prospective multicenter cohort funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. Patients were included if they were admitted for rehabilitation after moderate to severe TBI, were aged 23 years or older, and had at least 1 year of follow-up.

Magnetic resonance studies in different modes (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, DTI, T2 * GRE, SWAN) were performed in 162 patients with acute TBI. Statistical analysis was done using Statistica 6, 8 software and R programming language. A new advanced MRI-based classification of TBI was introduced implying the assessment of hemispheric and brainstem traumatic lesions level and localization. Statistically significant correlations were found between the Glasgow coma and outcome scales scores (p < 0.001), and the proposed MRI grading scale scores, which means a high prognostic value of the new classification. The knowledge of injured brain microanatomy coming from sensitive neuroimaging, in conjunction with the assessment of mechanisms, aggravating factors and clinical manifestation of brain trauma is the basis for the actual predictive model of TBI. The proposed advanced MRI classification contributes to this concept development.",2014,/,Zhurnal voprosy neirokhirurgii imeni N. N. Burdenko,78,1,13-Apr,,,24761591,#7747,Potapov 2014,,yes
"Traumatic axonal injury: the prognostic value of lesion load in corpus callosum, brain stem, and thalamus in different magnetic resonance imaging sequences.","Moen, Kent G; Brezova, Veronika; Skandsen, Toril; Haberg, Asta K; Folvik, Mari; Vik, Anne","The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of visible traumatic axonal injury (TAI) loads in different MRI sequences from the early phase after adjusting for established prognostic factors. Likewise, we sought to explore the prognostic role of early apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in normal-appearing corpus callosum. In this prospective study, 128 patients (mean age, 33.9 years; range, 11-69) with moderate (n = 64) and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were examined with MRI at a median of 8 days (range, 0-28) postinjury. TAI lesions in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2*-weighted gradient echo (T2*GRE) sequences were counted and FLAIR lesion volumes estimated. In patients and 47 healthy controls, mean ADC values were computed in 10 regions of interests in the normal-appearing corpus callosum. Outcome measure was the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) at 12 months. In patients with severe TBI, number of DWI lesions and volume of FLAIR lesions in the corpus callosum, brain stem, and thalamus predicted outcome in analyses with adjustment for age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and pupillary dilation (odds ratio, 1.3-6.9; p = <0.001-0.017). The addition of Rotterdam CT score and DWI lesions in the corpus callosum yielded the highest R2 (0.24), compared to all other MRI variables, including brain stem lesions. For patients with moderate TBI only the number of cortical contusions (p = 0.089) and Rotterdam CT score (p = 0.065) tended to predict outcome. Numbers of T2*GRE lesions did not affect outcome. Mean ADC values in the normal-appearing corpus callosum did not differ from controls. In conclusion, the loads of visible TAI lesions in the corpus callosum, brain stem, and thalamus in DWI and FLAIR were independent prognostic factors in patients with severe TBI. DWI lesions in the corpus callosum were the most important predictive MRI variable. Interestingly, number of cortical contusions in MRI and CT findings seemed more important for patients with moderate TBI.",2014,/,Journal of neurotrauma,31,17,1486-96,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2013.3258,24773587,#7742,Moen 2014,,yes

"The FOUR score predicts mortality, endotracheal intubation and ICU length of stay after traumatic brain injury.","Okasha, Ahmed Said; Fayed, Akram Muhammad; Saleh, Ahmad Sabry","BACKGROUND: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most widely accepted scale for assessing levels of consciousness, clinical status, as well as prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score is a new coma scale developed addressing the limitations of the GCS. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to compare the performance of the FOUR score vs. the GCS in predicting TBI outcomes., METHODS: From April to July 2011, 60 consecutive adult patients with TBI admitted to the Alexandria Main University Hospital intensive care units (ICU) were enrolled in the study. GCS and FOUR score were documented on arrival to emergency room. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, unfavorable outcome [Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE) 1-4], endotracheal intubation, and ICU length of stay (LOS)., RESULTS: Fifteen (25 %) patients died and 35 (58 %) had unfavorable outcome. When predicting mortality, the FOUR score showed significantly higher area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) than the GCS score (0.850 vs. 0.796, p = 0.025). The FOUR score and the GCS score were not different in predicting unfavorable outcome (AUC 0.813 vs. 0.779, p = 0.136) and endotracheal intubation (AUC 0.961 vs. 0.982, p = 0.06). Both scores were good predictors of ICU LOS (r (2) = 0.40 [FOUR score] vs. 0.41 [GCS score])., CONCLUSIONS: The FOUR score was superior to the GCS in predicting in-hospital mortality in TBI patients.

Prognostic value of neuropeptide proenkephalin A in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Gao, Jian-Bo; Tang, Wei-Dong; Wang, Xiao; Shen, Jia","High plasma proenkephalin A levels have been associated with poor clinical outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This prospective observatory study was designed to investigate the relationship between plasma proenkephalin A levels and 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome (defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. This study recruited 128 patients and 128 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Plasma proenkephalin A levels, as measured by chemoluminescence sandwich immunoassay, were statistically significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (239.1+/-93.0 pmol/L vs.81.3+/-22.1 pmol/L; P<0.001) and were correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale scores (r=-0.540, P<0.001). It was identified as an independent prognostic predictor of 1-week mortality [odds ratio (OR), 1.214; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.103-1.425; P<0.001], 6-month mortality (OR, 1.162; 95% CI, 1.101-1.372; P<0.001) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (OR, 1.116; 95% CI, 1.097-1.281; P<0.001). Moreover, it had high predictive value for 1-week mortality [area under curve (AUC), 0.852; 95% CI, 0.778-0.908], 6-month mortality (AUC, 0.841; 95% CI, 0.766-0.899) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (AUC, 0.830; 95% CI, 0.754-0.891). Furthermore, its predictive value was similar to Glasgow Coma Scale score's (all P>0.05). Yet, a combined logistic-regression model did not show that it statistically significantly improved the predictive value of Glasgow Coma Scale score (all P>0.05). Thus, it was proposed that enhanced plasma proenkephalin A could be a useful, complementary tool to predict short- or long-term clinical outcome after severe traumatic brain injury.

Comorbidity and insurance as predictors of disability after traumatic brain injury.,"Gardizi, Elmar; Hanks, Robin A; Millis, Scott R; Figueroa, Maritza J","OBJECTIVE: To examine the unique contribution of self-reported medical comorbidity and insurance type on disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., DESIGN: Inception cohort design at 1-year follow up., SETTING: A university affiliated rehabilitation hospital., PARTICIPANTS: Adults with mild-complicated to severe TBI (N=70)., INTERVENTION: Not applicable., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported medical comorbidities were measured using the Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, while insurance type was classified as commercial or government-funded; disability was measured using the Disability Rating Scale., RESULTS: Two models were run using multiple linear regression, and the best-fitting model was selected on the basis of Bayesian information criterion. The full model, which included self-reported medical comorbidity and insurance type, was significantly better fitting than the reduced model. Participants with a longer duration of posttraumatic amnesia, more self-reported medical comorbidities, and government insurance were more likely to have higher levels of disability. Meanwhile, individual organ systems were not predictive of disability., CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative effect of self-reported medical comorbidities and type of insurance coverage predict disability above and beyond well-known prognostic variables. Early assessment of medical complications and improving services provided by government-funded insurance may enhance quality of life and reduce long-term health care costs.

Prognostic significance of blood-brain barrier disruption in patients with severe nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury requiring decompressive craniectomy.,"Ho, Kwok M; Honeybul, Stephen; Yip, Cheng B; Silbert, Benjamin I","OBJECT: The authors assessed the risk factors and outcomes associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in patients with severe, nonpenetrating, traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring decompressive craniectomy., METHODS: At 2 major neurotrauma centers in Western Australia, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among 97 adult neurotrauma patients who required an external ventricular drain (EVD) and decompressive craniectomy during 2004-2012. Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were used to assess neurological outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with BBB disruption, defined by a ratio of total CSF protein concentrations to total plasma protein concentration > 0.007 in the earliest CSF specimen collected after TBI., RESULTS: Of the 252 patients who required decompressive craniectomy, 97 (39%) required an EVD to control intracranial pressure, and biochemical evidence of BBB disruption was observed in 43 (44%). Presence of disruption was associated with more severe TBI (median predicted risk for unfavorable outcome 75% vs 63%, respectively; p = 0.001) and with worse outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 months than was absence of BBB disruption (72% vs 37% unfavorable outcomes, respectively; p = 0.015). The only risk factor significantly associated with increased risk for BBB disruption was presence of nonevacuated intracerebral hematoma (> 1 cm diameter) (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.23-7.50; p = 0.016). Although BBB disruption was associated with more severe TBI and worse long-term outcomes, when combined with the prognostic information contained in the Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury (CRASH) prognostic model, it did not seem to add significant prognostic value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.855 vs 0.864, respectively; p = 0.453)., CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical evidence of BBB disruption after severe nonpenetrating TBI was common, especially among patients with large intracerebral hematomas.

Isolated traumatic brain injury and venous thromboembolism.,"Van Gent, Jan-Michael; Bandle, Jesse; Calvo, Richard Y; Zander, Ashley L; Olson, Erik J; Shackford, Steven R; Peck, Kimberly A; Sise, C Beth; Sise, Michael J","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered an independent risk factor of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the role of TBI severity in VTE risk has not been determined. We hypothesized that increased severity of brain injury in patients with isolated TBI (iTBI) is associated with an increased incidence of VTE., METHODS: The records of patients admitted from June 2006 to December 2011 were reviewed for injury data, VTE risk factors, results of lower extremity surveillance ultrasound, and severity of TBI. Patients were identified by DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev. codes for TBI, and only those with a nonhead Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 1 or lower, indicating minimal associated injury, were included. The association of iTBI and VTE was determined using a case-control design. Among iTBI patients, those diagnosed with VTE (cases) were matched for age, sex, and admission year to those without VTE (controls). Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: There were 345 iTBI patients: 41 cases (12%) and 304 controls (88%). A total of 151 controls could not be matched to an appropriate case and were excluded. Of the remaining 153 controls, 1 to 16 controls were matched to each of the 41 VTE cases. Compared with the controls, the cases had a higher mean head-AIS score (4.4 vs. 3.9, p = 0.001) and overall Injury Severity Score (20.4 vs. 16.8, p = 0.001). Following adjustment for all factors found to be associated with VTE (ventilator days, central line placement, operative time > 2 hours, chemoprophylaxis, history of VTE, and history of cancer), the cases were significantly more likely to have a greater head injury severity (head-AIS score >= 5; odds ratio, 5.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-17.30; p = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: The incidence of VTE in iTBI patients was significantly associated with the severity of TBI.

Plasma concentrations of these biomarkers were statistically significantly higher in all patients than in healthy controls, in non-survivors than in survivors and in patients with unfavorable outcome than with favorable outcome. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of plasma concentrations of these biomarkers were similar to those of Glasgow Coma Scale score for prognostic prediction. Except plasma copeptin concentration, other biomarkers concentrations in plasma did not statistically significantly improve prognostic predictive value of Glasgow Coma Scale score.

The outcome of prognostic cut-off points was calculated by GCS and CSI using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve regarding the time of admission and third day of hospitalization. Sensitivity, specificity and other predictive values for both indices were calculated., RESULTS: Of the 60 assessed patients, 14 patients had mild, 13 patients had moderate and 33 patients had severe injuries.

Serum soluble CD40 Ligand levels are associated with severity and mortality of brain trauma injury patients.,"Lorente, Leonardo; Martin, Maria M; Gonzalez-Rivero, Agustin F; Ramos, Luis; Argueso, Monica; Caceres, Juan J; Sole-Violan, Jordi; Serrano, Nicolas; Rodriguez, Sergio T; Jimenez, Alejandro; Borreguero-Leon, Juan M","BACKGROUND: Serum soluble CD40 Ligand (sCD40L) levels, which exhibit prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties, have not been studied in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether serum sCD40L levels are associated with severity and mortality in patients with severe TBI., METHODS: This was a prospective, observational and multicenter study carried out in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Patients with severe TBI defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lower than 9 were included, while those with Injury Severity Score (ISS) in non-cranial aspects higher than 9 were excluded. Serum levels of sCD40L were measured on the day of TBI. Endpoint was established in 30-day mortality., RESULTS: We found higher serum sCD40L levels (P<0.001) in non-surviving TBI patients (N=27) than in survivor ones (N=73). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum sCD40L levels were associated with 30-day mortality (OR=1.58; 95% CI=1.12-2.21; P=0.008) controlling for APACHE-II score and computer tomography findings. The area under the curve (AUC) for serum sCD40L levels as predictor of 30-day mortality was 0.79 (95% CI=0.70-0.86; P<0.001). Survival analysis showed that patients with serum sCD40L levels higher than 2.11 ng/mL presented increased 30-day mortality than patients with lower levels (Hazard ratio=9.0; 95% CI=4.25-19.27; P<0.001).

A standardized assessment was performed for each patient including clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological data collected at the initial stage, The outcomes were assessed at least 2 years after injury. Depending on the patients' availability and ability to communicate, the assessments included measures of dependency for activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive functions, behaviour, mood, and quality of life., RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included, of whom ten were autonomous for ADL at the time of assessment. Memory complaints, attentional deficits, anxiety, and irritability were the main long-term impairments observed. A correlation analysis showed significant correlations between the dependency level (as rated by the Functional Independence Measure) and each of length of coma, length of the post-traumatic amnesia, and the N100 auditory evoked potentials., DISCUSSION: These results confirm the uniqueness of each patient regarding the long-term consequences of a traumatic brain injury and the multi-determined nature of each prognosis.

Outcome and surgical management for geriatric traumatic brain injury: analysis of 888 cases registered in the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank.,"Shimoda, Kentaro; Maeda, Takeshi; Tado, Masahiro; Yoshino, Atsuo; Katayama, Yoichi; Bullock, M Ross","OBJECTIVE: As the aged population is rapidly growing globally, geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) becomes an increasing problem. There are higher mortality and poorer functional outcome in the geriatric TBI population (>=65 years) compared with younger groups despite neurosurgical interventions. Therefore, current treatment priorities and cost-effectiveness should be critically examined. We evaluated the benefit of surgical management in the elderly (>=65 years) after TBI., METHODS: A total of 3194 patients with confirmed TBI were enrolled from 1998 to 2011, in the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank. Retrospective analysis was conducted from the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank on 888 (28%) patients (>=65 years) who did and did not undergo surgery. In particular, the effect of low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (3-5) was compared with outcome with and without surgery., RESULTS: Of all the patients 65 years of age and over, 478 (54%) were given surgical management (craniectomy, craniotomy, or burr-hole evacuation). This group of patients had significantly more favorable outcome at 6 months (18% vs. 7%) and less mortality (62% vs. 81%). However, within this surgical group, patients with initial GCS scores of 3-5 had significantly more unfavorable outcome (96% vs. 79%) and more mortality (87% vs. 57%) compared with those with GCS scores of 6-15., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that age is a major determinant of outcome after TBI. In addition, we found that neurosurgical management is associated with the improvement of the prognosis and a decrease in the rate of mortality in geriatric TBI. However, surgical management was not shown to be an effective treatment in elderly patients with GCS scores of 3-5. Copyright Â© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Effect of preinjury warfarin use on outcomes after head trauma in Medicare beneficiaries.,"Collins, Courtney E; Witkowski, Elan R; Flahive, Julie M; Anderson, Fred A Jr; Santry, Heena P","BACKGROUND: Elderly Americans are at increased risk of head trauma, particularly fall related. The effect of warfarin on head trauma outcomes remains controversial., METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with head injuries from 2009 to 2011 were identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 code. Preinjury warfarin use was determined using Part D claims. Multiple logistic regression models determined the association of preinjury warfarin on need for hospitalization, intensive care unit care, and occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage. Association between warfarin and in-hospital mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional hazard model., RESULTS: Of 11,078 head injured patients, 5.2% were injured while on warfarin.

Correlation between arterial blood gas analysis and outcome in patients with severe head trauma.,"Bazzazi, Amirmohammad; Hasanloei, Mohammad Amin Valizade; Mahoori, Alireza; Gholamnejad, Mahdia; Tarverdipour, Habibeh","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is one of the major concerns of global public health, because it is the main cause of morbidity and mortality between young people. This study aimed to investigate the possible association between the parameters of arterial blood gas (ABG) and outcome of patients with severe head trauma., METHODS: In this prospective study, 70 patients with severe head trauma were studied in Urmia Imam Khomeini hospital during 18-month period of time. The parameters of ABG were documented within the 1st hour of admission, and their correlation was evaluated with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and Glasgow outcome score (GOS). These parameters also were compared between expired and discharged patients., RESULTS: Seventy patients with severe head trauma including 60 males (85.7%) and 10 females (14.3%) with a mean age of 34.34+/-14.82 (range: 18-76) years were studied. The mortality rate during hospitalization was 38.6% (n=27). There was no significant correlation between the parameters of ABG and GCS score and GOS scores.

Predicting outcome in traumatic brain injury: development of a novel computerized tomography classification system (Helsinki computerized tomography score).,"Raj, Rahul; Siironen, Jari; Skrifvars, Markus B; Hernesniemi, Juha; Kivisaari, Riku","BACKGROUND: Early computerized tomography (CT) abnormalities are important predictors of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI)., OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel CT scoring system (Helsinki CT score) and to compare it with the Marshall CT classification and the Rotterdam CT score in predicting long-term outcome of patients with TBI., METHODS: Eight hundred sixty-nine consecutive TBI patients were included in this open-cohort, retrospective, single-center study. Logistic regression was used to develop the Helsinki CT score. The scores from the Marshall, Rotterdam, and Helsinki CT scoring methods were added to a clinical model based on age, motor score, and pupils to evaluate their value in predicting outcome. Internal validity was assessed by a bootstrap technique and expressed as area under the curve (AUC). Outcome was 6-month unfavorable neurological outcome and mortality., RESULTS: Variables included in the Helsinki CT score were bleeding type and size, intraventricular hemorrhage, and suprasellar cisterns. In the present data set, the performance of the Helsinki CT score was superior to that of the Marshall CT and Rotterdam CT scores (AUC, 0.74-0.75 vs 0.63-0.70; P < .001). Addition of the Helsinki CT score modestly increased prognostic performance of the clinical model (AUC neurological outcome +0.02 [P = .002]; AUC mortality, +0.01 [P = .21]). In contrast, the Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores were of no additional predictive value to the clinical model (P > .05)., CONCLUSION: Use of the novel Helsinki CT score improved outcome prediction accuracy, and the Helsinki CT score is a feasible alternative to the Rotterdam and Marshall CT systems.

Predicting outcome in severe traumatic brain injury using a simple prognostic model.,"Sobuwa, Simpiwe; Hartzenberg, Henry Benjamin; Geduld, Heike; Uys, Corrie","BACKGROUND: Several studies have made it possible to predict outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) making it beneficial as an aid for clinical decision-making in the emergency setting. However, reliable predictive models are lacking for resource-limited prehospital settings such as those in developing countries like South Africa., OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple predictive model for severe TBI using clinical variables in a South African prehospital setting., METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted at two level-one centres in Cape Town, South Africa, for severe TBI were included. A binary logistic regression model was used, which included three predictor variables: oxygen saturation (SpO2), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and pupil reactivity. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to assess outcome on hospital discharge., RESULTS: A total of 74.4% of the outcomes were correctly predicted by the logistic regression model. The model demonstrated SpO2 (p=0.019), GCS (p=0.001) and pupil reactivity (p=0.002) as independently significant predictors of outcome in severe TBI.

Because of the inability of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TBI to demonstrate the expected benefit of reducing unfavorable outcomes, the IMPACT (International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury) studies provided new methods for performing prognostic studies of TBI. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a prognostic model for early death (within 48 hours). The secondary aim was to identify patients who were more likely to succumb to an early death to limit their inclusion in RCTs and to improve the efficiency of RCTs., METHODS: The derivation cohort was recruited at 1 center, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid (1990-2003, 925 patients). The validation cohort was recruited in 2004-2006 from 7 study centers (374 patients). The eligible patients had suffered closed severe TBIs. The study outcome was early death (within 48 hours post-TBI). The predictors were selected using logistic regression modeling with bootstrapping techniques, and a penalized reduction was used. A risk score was developed based on the regression coefficients of the variables included in the final model., RESULTS: In the validation set, the final model showed a predictive ability of 50% (Nagelkerke R(2)), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 89% and an acceptable calibration (goodness-of-fit test, p = 0.32). The final model included 7 variables, and it was used to develop a risk score with a range from 0 to 20 points. Age provided 0, 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the age group; motor score provided 0 points, 2 (untestable), or 3 (no response); pupillary reactivity, 0, 2 (1 pupil reacted), or 6 (no pupil reacted); shock, 0 (no) or 2 (yes); subarachnoid hemorrhage, 0 or 1 (severe deposit); cisternal status, 0 or 3 (compressed/absent); and epidural hematoma, 0 (yes) or 2 (no). Based on the risk of early death estimated with the model, 4 risk of early death groups were established: low risk, sum score 0-3 (< 1% predicted mortality); moderate risk, sum score 4-8 (predicted mortality between 1% and 10%); high risk, sum score 9-12 (probability of early death between 10% and 50%); and very high risk, sum score 13-20 (early mortality probability > 50%). This score could be used for selecting patients for clinical studies. For example, if patients with very high risk scores were excluded from our study sample, the patients included (eligibility score < 13) would represent 80% of the original sample and only 23% of the patients who died early., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of Glasgow Coma Scale score, CT scanning results, and secondary insult data into a prognostic score improved the prediction of early death and the classification of TBI patients.",2014,/,Journal of neurosurgery,121,6,1314-22,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2014.7.JNS131874,25237737,#7584,Gomez 2014,,yes
Outcome prediction in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: a focus on computed tomography variables.,"Jacobs, Bram; Beems, Tjemme; van der Vliet, Ton M; van Vugt, Arie B; Hoedemaekers, Cornelia; Horn, Janneke; Franschman, Gaby; Haitsma, Ian; van der Naalt, Joukje; Andriessen, Teuntje M J C; Borm, George F; Vos, Pieter E","BACKGROUND: With this study we aimed to design validated outcome prediction models in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) using demographic, clinical, and radiological parameters., METHODS: Seven hundred consecutive moderate or severe TBI patients were included in this observational prospective cohort study. After inclusion, clinical data were collected, initial head computed tomography (CT) scans were rated, and at 6 months outcome was determined using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association between potential predictors and three different outcome endpoints. The prognostic models that resulted were externally validated in a national Dutch TBI cohort., RESULTS: In line with previous literature we identified age, pupil responses, Glasgow Coma Scale score and the occurrence of a hypotensive episode post-injury as predictors. Furthermore, several CT characteristics were associated with outcome; the aspect of the ambient cisterns being the most powerful. After external validation using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis our prediction models demonstrated adequate discriminative values, quantified by the area under the ROC curve, of 0.86 for death versus survival and 0.83 for unfavorable versus favorable outcome. Discriminative power was less for unfavorable outcome in survivors: 0.69., CONCLUSIONS: Outcome prediction in moderate and severe TBI might be improved using the models that were designed in this study.

In-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury surgery: a nationwide population-based comparison of mortality predictors used in artificial neural network and logistic regression models.,"Shi, Hon-Yi; Hwang, Shiuh-Lin; Lee, King-Teh; Lin, Chih-Lung","OBJECT: Most reports compare artificial neural network (ANN) models and logistic regression models in only a single data set, and the essential issue of internal validity (reproducibility) of the models has not been adequately addressed. This study proposes to validate the use of the ANN model for predicting in-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI) surgery and to compare the predictive accuracy of ANN with that of the logistic regression model., METHODS: The authors of this study retrospectively analyzed 16,956 patients with TBI nationwide who were surgically treated in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009. For every 1000 pairs of ANN and logistic regression models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired t-tests. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative importance of input parameters in the ANN model and to rank the variables in order of importance., RESULTS: The ANN model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy in 95.15% of cases, in terms of Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics in 43.68% of cases, and in terms of the AUC in 89.14% of cases. The global sensitivity analysis of in-hospital mortality also showed that the most influential (sensitive) parameters in the ANN model were surgeon volume followed by hospital volume, Charlson comorbidity index score, length of stay, sex, and age., CONCLUSIONS: This work supports the continued use of ANNs for predictive modeling of neurosurgery outcomes.

Outcomes measured were Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), the FIM R instrument, length of stay (LOS) and discharge destination., MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Fifty-four per cent of patients with MTBI with a median GOS-E of 2 were discharged home with no need for further follow-up. Age, LOS, lower Glasgow score (GCS) at admission, insurance coverage and positive CT scans were associated with rehabilitation referrals on discharge. Age, LOS, alcohol and drug abuse, motor vehicle collision and lower GCS at admission were associated with greater physical disabilities and functional impairment at discharge. FIM R cognitive functional scores were higher in women, younger patients and patients without psychiatric disorders. Brain lesions were correlated with longer LOS.

Group-based trajectory analysis applications for prognostic biomarker model development in severe TBI: a practical example.,"Niyonkuru, Christian; Wagner, Amy K; Ozawa, Haishin; Amin, Krutika; Goyal, Akash; Fabio, Anthony","Over the last decade, biomarker research has identified potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers have shown promise in predicting long-term outcome after severe TBI. Despite this increased focus on identifying biomarkers for outcome prognostication after a severe TBI, several challenges still exist in effectively modeling the significant heterogeneity observed in TBI-related pathology, as well as the biomarker-outcome relationships. Biomarker data collected over time are usually summarized into single-point estimates (e.g., average or peak biomarker levels), which are, in turn, used to examine the relationships between biomarker levels and outcomes. Further, many biomarker studies to date have focused on the prediction power of biomarkers without controlling for potential clinical and demographic confounders that have been previously shown to affect long-term outcome. In this article, we demonstrate the application of a practical approach to delineate and describe distinct subpopulations having similar longitudinal biomarker profiles and to model the relationships between these biomarker profiles and outcomes while taking into account potential confounding factors. As an example, we demonstrate a group-based modeling technique to identify temporal S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100b) profiles, measured from CSF over the first week post-injury, in a sample of adult subjects with TBI, and we use multivariate logistic regression to show that the prediction power of S100b biomarker profiles can be superior to the prediction power of single-point estimates.",2013,/,Journal of neurotrauma,30,11,938-45,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.2578,23421760,#8367,Niyonkuru 2013,,yes
Prognostic value of time-related Glasgow coma scale components in severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective evaluation with respect to 1-year survival and functional outcome.,"Kouloulas, Efthimios J; Papadeas, Alexandros G; Michail, Xanthi; Sakas, Damianos E; Boviatsis, Efstathios J","The severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is determined by many variables, the complexity of which has made prediction of functional outcome an elusive target. To evaluate whether the three components of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and their alterations over time can serve as predictors of functional outcome after a severe TBI at 12 months after the TBI insult, we carried out a prospective study of patients with severe TBI. Seventy patients were initially enrolled. Data were retrieved from the emergency department records and the patients' intensive care unit, neurosurgical, and rehabilitation unit records. All patients underwent follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. GCS components were evaluated on the day of injury and 2 weeks after injury. Functional outcome was estimated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Functional Independence Measure motor scale. It was evaluated during rehabilitation and at 12 months after injury. Fifty-one patients were alive and followed up until 12 months. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses were carried out. In terms of functional outcome at 12 months, only GCS on day 15 was found to be a prognostic factor, with all its subscales being related to outcome 12 months later, whereas a higher GCS score on day 15 was also related to survival. A higher motor and verbal response on day 15 was strongly associated with a patient's functional independence, whereby the motor response was a better predictor. The GCS motor score 2 weeks after injury was statistically significantly associated with the 12-month functional outcome in TBI survivors. Motor response was the most useful predictor among the GCS components with respect to the long-term functional outcome in patients with severe TBI.",2013,/,International journal of rehabilitation research.

Rehabilitation outcome of unconscious traumatic brain injury patients.,"Klein, Anke-Maria; Howell, Kaitlen; Vogler, Jana; Grill, Eva; Straube, Andreas; Bender, Andreas","Outcome prediction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with severe disorders of consciousness (DOC) at the end of their time in an intensive care setting is important for clinical decision making and counseling of relatives, and constitutes a major challenge. Even the question of what constitutes an improved outcome is controversially discussed. We have conducted a retrospective cohort study for the rehabilitation dynamics and outcome of TBI patients with DOC. Out of 188 patients, 37.2% emerged from a minimally conscious state (MCS) and 16.5% achieved at least partial functional independence after a mean observation period of 107 days (range 1-399 days). This reflects that emergence from MCS is much easier to achieve than functional independence. Logistic regression analysis identified age and level of consciousness upon admission to neurorehabilitation as independent prognostic factors for both outcomes. The group who reached at least partial functional independence started to improve significantly more than the corresponding outcome group by post-injury week 7, and the average time to reach this functional status was 18 weeks. In contrast, the group who emerged from MCS started to improve after 6 weeks. The longest delay between brain injury and the beginning of functional improvement (measured by biweekly Functional Independence Measure [FIM] scores) still compatible with reaching at least partial functional independence was 18 weeks. In conclusion, despite a strong negative selection, a substantial proportion of severe TBI patients with DOC achieve functional improvements or at least emerge from MCS within the inpatient rehabilitation phase. In order to avoid self-fulfilling prophecies in decision making, it is important to be aware of the fact that the beginning of clinical improvement may take several months after brain injury.

Timing of intracranial hypertension following severe traumatic brain injury.,"Stein, Deborah M; Brenner, Megan; Hu, Peter F; Yang, Shiming; Hall, Erin C; Stansbury, Lynn G; Menaker, Jay; Scalea, Thomas M","BACKGROUND: We asked whether continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring data could provide objective measures of the degree and timing of intracranial hypertension (ICH) in the first week of neurotrauma critical care and whether such data could be linked to outcome., METHODS: We enrolled adult (>17 years old) patients admitted to our Level I trauma center within 6 h of severe TBI. ICP data were automatically captured and ICP 5-minute means were grouped into 12-hour time periods from admission (hour 0) to >7 days (hour 180). Means, maximum, percent time (% time), and pressure-times-time dose (PTD, mmHg h) of ICP >20 mmHg and >30 mmHg were calculated for each time period., RESULTS: From 2008 to 2010, we enrolled 191 patients. Only 2.1% had no episodes of ICH. The timing of maximum PTD20 was relatively equally distributed across the 15 time periods. Median ICP, PTD20, %time20, and %time30 were all significantly higher in the 84-180 h time period than the 0-84 h time period. Stratified by functional outcome, those with poor functional outcome had significantly more ICH in hours 84-180. Multivariate analysis revealed that, after 84 h of monitoring, every 5% increase in PTD20 was independently associated with 21% higher odds of having a poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.42, p = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Although early elevations in ICP occur, ICPs are the highest later in the hospital course than previously understood, and temporal patterns of ICP elevation are associated with functional outcome.

Demographic and clinical data and brain CT scan results were recorded. ONSD for each eye was measured on the initial CT scan. The group of ICU survivors was compared to non-survivors. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was evaluated six months after ICU discharge., RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included (age: 43+/-18; 81% males; mean Injury Severity Score: 35+/-15; ICU mortality: 28.5% (n=22)). Mean ONSD on the initial brain CT scan was 7.8+/-0.1 mm in non-survivors vs. 6.8+/-0.1 mm in survivors (P<0.001). The operative value of ONSD was a good predictor of mortality (area under the curve: 0.805). An ONSD cutoff>=7.3 had a sensitivity of 86.4% and a specificity of 74.6% and was independently associated with mortality in this population (adjusted odds ratio 95% confidence interval: 22.7 (3.2 to 159.6), P=0.002). There was a relationship between initial ONSD values and six-month GOS (P=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: ONSD measured on the initial brain CT scan is independently associated with ICU mortality rate (when >=7.3 mm) in severe TBI patients.See related commentary by Masquere et al.,http://ccforum.com/content/17/3/151.",2013,/,"Critical care (London, England)",17,2,R61,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc12589,23536993,#8312,Legrand 2013,,yes
Detection of beta-amyloid oligomers as a predictor of neurological outcome after brain injury.,"Gatson, Joshua Wayne; Warren, Victoria; Abdelfattah, Kareem; Wolf, Steven; Hynan, Linda S; Moore, Carol; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Minei, Joseph P; Madden, Christopher; Wigginton, Jane G","OBJECT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer-like dementia. In previous studies, an increase in beta-amyloid (Abeta) monomers, such as beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42), in the CSF of patients with TBI has been shown to correlate with a decrease in amyloid plaques in the brain and improved neurological outcomes. In this study, the authors hypothesized that the levels of toxic high-molecular-weight beta-amyloid oligomers are increased in the brain and are detectable within the CSF of TBI patients with poor neurological outcomes., METHODS: Samples of CSF were collected from 18 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale Scores 3-8) and a ventriculostomy. In all cases the CSF was collected within 72 hours of injury. The CSF levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Abeta42 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of high-molecular-weight beta-amyloid oligomers were measured using Western blot analysis., RESULTS: Patients with good outcomes showed an increase in the levels of CSF Abeta42 (p = 0.003). Those with bad outcomes exhibited an increase in CSF levels of beta-amyloid oligomers (p = 0.009) and NSE (p = 0.001). In addition, the CSF oligomer levels correlated with the scores on the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (r = -0.89, p = 0.0001), disability rating scale scores (r = 0.77, p = 0.005), CSF Abeta42 levels (r = -0.42, p = 0.12), and CSF NSE levels (r = 0.70, p = 0.004).

alpha-Synuclein in CSF of patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Mondello, Stefania; Buki, Andras; Italiano, Domenico; Jeromin, Andreas","OBJECTIVE: The study aims to examine alpha-synuclein in the CSF of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its relationship with clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes., METHODS: This prospective case-control study enrolled patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Score <= 8) who underwent ventriculostomy. CSF samples were taken from each TBI patient at admission and daily for up to 8 days after injury and successively assessed by ELISA. Control CSF was collected for analysis from subjects receiving lumbar puncture for other medical reasons. We used trajectory analysis to identify distinct temporal profiles of CSF alpha-synuclein that were compared with clinical outcomes., RESULTS: CSF alpha-synuclein was elevated in TBI patients after injury as compared to controls (p = 0.0008). Overall, patients who died had higher concentrations (area under the curve) over 8 days of observation compared to those who survived at 6 months postinjury (p = 0.002). Two distinct temporal alpha-synuclein profiles were recognized over time. Subjects who died had consistently elevated alpha-synuclein levels compared to those who survived with alpha-synuclein levels near controls. High-risk trajectory was a strong and accurate predictor of death with 100% specificity and a very high sensitivity (83%)., CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that in severe TBI patients, substantial increase of CSF alpha-synuclein may indicate widespread neurodegeneration and reflect secondary neuropathologic events occurring after injury.

[Effect of albumin and hemoglobin level on prognosis of patients with uncomplicated severe traumatic brain injury: a retrospective cohort study].,"Yang, Tian-jun; Fei, Ming-ming; Ye, Wen; Pan, Ai-jun; Liu, Bao","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the best level of albumin and hemoglobin for the patients with uncomplicated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. One hundred and sixty-eight patients with uncomplicated severe TBI admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Anhui Provincial Hospital were enrolled. The relationship between albumin and hemoglobin level within 3 days after admission and prognosis was analyzed. Mean 3-day albumin level was obtained, and then the patients were divided into <25, 25-28, 29-31 and >=32 g/L groups according to quartiles based on mean albumin, and also were divided into <90, 90-99, 100-109 and>=110 g/L groups according to the mean hemoglobin concentration. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to model the association between mean albumin and hemoglobin concentration and prognosis., RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were enrolled based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Among them, 32 patients (29.4%) received a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and 24 patients (22.0%) were given albumin treatment. According to the average level of albumin, there were significant differences in mortality among <25, 25-28, 29-31 and >=32 g/L groups [85.2%(23/27), 59.3%(16/27), 32.1%(9/28), 44.4%(12/27), respectively, P=0.001].

Therefore, the early detection of patients at risk for brain death (BD) is a priority for transplant teams seeking more efficient identification of potential donors. In the extensive literature on S100B as a biomarker for traumatic brain injury (TBI), no evidence appears to exist on its prognostic capacity as a predictor of BD after severe TBI. The objective of this study is to assess the value of including acute S100B levels in standard clinical data as an early screening tool for BD after severe TBI. This prospective study included patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] <= 8) admitted to our Neurocritical Care Unit over a 30 month period. We collected the following clinical variables: age, gender, GCS score, pupillary alterations at admission, hypotension and pre-hospital desaturation, CT scan results, isolated TBI or other related injuries, Injury Severity Score (ISS), serum S100B levels at admission and 24 h post-admission, and a final diagnosis regarding BD. Of the 140 patients studied, 11.4% developed BD and showed significantly higher S100B concentrations (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that bilateral unresponsive mydriasis at admission and serum S100B at 24 h post-admission had odds ratios (ORs) of 21.35 (p=0.005) and 4.9 (p=0.010), respectively. The same analysis on patients with photomotor reflex in one pupil at admission left only the 24 h S100B sample in the model (OR=15.5; p=0.009).

Risk of unfavorable long-term outcome in older adults with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and anticoagulant or antiplatelet use.,"Nishijima, Daniel K; Shahlaie, Kiarash; Sarkar, Korak; Rudisill, Nancy; Holmes, James F","STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare neurological outcomes at 6 months in older patients with preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use and mild traumatic intracranial hemorrhage with those without prior use of these medications., METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted at a Level 1 trauma center from April 2009 to July 2010. Patients older than 55 years with isolated mild head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15 and Abbreviated Injury Score < 3 in nonhead body region) were included. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were abstracted from an existing traumatic brain injury database. The primary end point of unfavorable extended Glasgow Outcome Score at 6 months was compared between patients with and without preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use., RESULTS: Seventy-seven eligible patients were identified: 27 (35%) with preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use and 50 (65%) without. Baseline characteristics (sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score, computed tomography score, and in-hospital mortality) were similar between cohorts, although the preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel cohort was older than the control group (P < .05). Patients in the preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel cohort were more likely to have an unfavorable outcome (16/27; 59.3%; 95% confidence interval, 40.7%-77.8%) as compared with those without (18/50; 36.0%; 95% confidence interval, 22.7%-49.3%) (P = .05)., CONCLUSION: Older adults with preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use and mild traumatic intracranial hemorrhage may be at an increased risk for unfavorable long-term neurological outcomes compared with similar patients without preinjury use of these medications.

Neuromarkers as diagnostic adjuvant to cranial CT in closed traumatic brain injury patients admitted to ICU: A preliminary comparative study,Shehab H.A.; Nassar Y.H. ,"Objectives: Evaluating the diagnostic and/or prognostic yield of serum levels of three neuromarkers, serum S100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), in patients who were admitted to surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and had closed traumatic brain injury with suspicious presence of intracranial hematoma compared versus cranial CT (CCT) as a gold standard diagnostic modality. Patients and Methods: The study included 70 patients who had sustained a closed traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring intensive care and/or surgical interference. All patients underwent clinical evaluation for all traumatized organs using Injury Severity Score (ISS) and concerning TBI Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded after non-surgical resuscitation. Then, all underwent CT scanning of the brain and patients with a surgically treatable mass underwent decompressive craniotomy, while patients free of hematoma or with minute-to-small hematoma not necessitating surgical interference were kept under observation. Venous blood samples were obtained from all enrolled patients at time of admission and patients who showed deterioration during conservative treatment gave second sample for ELISA estimation of serum S100 protein, NSE and GFAP. Result(s): Forty-three patients had intracranial hematoma (Positive CCT); 26 patients underwent surgical interference, while the other 17 hematoma patients and 27 hematoma free patients (Negative CCT) were kept under observation. Of them 15 patients; 10 with hematoma and five who were hematoma free developed symptoms of increased ICP and follow-up CCT examination defined five cases required surgical interference with 66.7% rate for unnecessary follow-up CCT. Thirty-nine patients (55.7%) responded to conservative treatment and were discharged to the ward, while a total of 31 patients (44.3%) had surgical interference. Mean serum levels of studied parameters were significantly higher in all patients compared to controls with significantly higher levels in patients who had positive CCT compared to those who had negative CCT and in patients who required surgical interference compared to those managed conservatively. Patients who showed deterioration had significantly 2nd sample higher serum levels of S100 protein and GFAP, but non-significantly higher serum NSE levels compared to at admission levels. Percentage of increase of serum GFAP levels in follow-up sample obtained from patients who had positive CCT was significantly higher compared to the percentage of increase in serum S100 protein and NSE. Conclusion(s): Estimation of serum levels of neuromarkers as adjuvant diagnostic and prognostic tools for closed TBI patients, but serum level of GFAP showed superior applicability and was more valid prognostic modality that could spare unnecessary CCT if applied as the percentage of change in comparison to at admission levels.

Prevalence and impact of diffuse axonal injury in patients with moderate and severe head injury: A cohort study of early magnetic resonance imaging findings and 1-year outcome: Clinical article,Skandsen T.; Kvistad K.A.; Solheim O.; Strand I.H.; Folvik M.; Anne V. ,"Object. In this prospective cohort study the authors examined patients with moderate to severe head injuries using MR imaging in the early phase. The objective was to explore the occurrence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and determine whether DAI was related to level of consciousness and patient outcome. Methods. One hundred and fifty-nine patients (age range 5-65 years) with traumatic brain injury, who survived the acute phase, and who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-13 were admitted between October 2004 and August 2008. Of these 159 patients, 106 were examined using MR imaging within 4 weeks postinjury. Patients were classified into 1 of 3 stages of DAI: Stage 1, in which lesions were confined to the lobar white matter; Stage 2, in which there were callosal lesions; and Stage 3, in which lesions occurred in the dorsolateral brainstem. The outcome measure used 12 months postinjury was the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Results. Diffuse axonal injury was detected in 72% of the patients and a combination of DAI and contusions or hematomas was found in 50%. The GCS score was significantly lower in patients with ""pure DAI"" (median GCS Score 9) than in patients without DAI (median GCS Score 12; p < 0.001). The GCS score was related to outcome only in those patients with DAI (r = 0.47; p = 0.001). Patients with DAI had a median GOSE score of 7, and patients without DAI had a median GOSE score of 8 (p = 0.10). Outcome was better in patients with DAI Stage 1 (median GOSE Score 8) and DAI Stage 2 (median GOSE Score 7.5) than in patients with DAI Stage 3 (median GOSE Score 4; p < 0.001). Thus, in patients without any brainstem injury, there was no difference in good recovery between patients with DAI (67%) and patients without DAI (66%). Conclusions. Diffuse axonal injury was found in almost three-quarters of the patients with moderate and severe head injury who survived the acute phase. Diffuse axonal injury influenced the level of consciousness, and only in patients with DAI was GCS score related to outcome.

Regional brain morphometry predicts memory rehabilitation outcome after traumatic brain injury,Strangman G.E.; O'Neil-Pirozzi T.M.; Supelana C.; Goldstein R.; Katz D.I.; Glenn M.B. ,"Cognitive deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly include difficulties with memory, attention, and executive dysfunction. These deficits are amenable to cognitive rehabilitation, but optimally selecting rehabilitation programs for individual patients remains a challenge. Recent methods for quantifying regional brain morphometry allow for automated quantification of tissue volumes in numerous distinct brain structures. We hypothesized that such quantitative structural information could help identify individuals more or less likely to benefit from memory rehabilitation. Fifty individuals with TBI of all severities who reported having memory difficulties first underwent structural MRI scanning. They then participated in a 12 session memory rehabilitation program emphasizing internal memory strategies (I-MEMS). Primary outcome measures (HVLT, RBMT) were collected at the time of the MRI scan, immediately following therapy, and again at 1-month post-therapy. Regional brain volumes were used to predict outcome, adjusting for standard predictors (e.g., injury severity, age, education, pretest scores). We identified several brain regions that provided significant predictions of rehabilitation outcome, including the volume of the hippocampus, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, and several subregions of the cingulate cortex. The prediction range of regional brain volumes were in some cases nearly equal in magnitude to prediction ranges provided by pretest scores on the outcome variable. We conclude that specific cerebral networks including these regions may contribute to learning during I-MEMS rehabilitation, and suggest that morphometric measures may provide substantial predictive value for rehabilitation outcome in other cognitive interventions as well.

Result(s): Mean sVAP-1 activity in trauma patients was significantly lower than that of controls (P< 0.0001), and the level was negatively correlated with circulating leucocytes and neutrophils (P< 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between lower sVAP-1 activity and injury patterns. However, plasma sVAP-1 activity increased significantly in accordance with the severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the patients with sVAP-1 value above 8.61. nmol/ml/h have much higher mortality rate (25.0%) than patients with sVAP-1 value lower than 8.61. nmol/ml/h (0.0%) (P = 0.011).

This study was a multicenter prospective design involving four hospitals, a 6-month observation, and follow-up. Of 352 traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, serial CT scan indicated approximately one third of patients developed progressive hemorrhage, which was most frequently observed in the frontal, temporal, and orbitofrontal lobes of patients with brain contusion. PHI-positive patients exhibited poor prognosis, as indicated by prolonged length of hospital/intensive care unit stay and high mortality. More importantly, a DIC score after TBI, as well as patient age and sex, could serve as predictors for PHI. In addition, DIC scores were closely associated with injury severity.

Genu of corpus callosum as a prognostic factor in diffuse axonal injury: Clinical article,Matsukawa H.; Shinoda M.; Fujii M.; Takahashi O.; Yamamoto D.; Murakata A.; Ishikawa R. ,"Object. Previous studies have shown a relationship between a patient's stage of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and outcome. However, few studies have assessed whether a specific lesion or type of corpus callosum injury (CCI) influences outcome in patients with DAI. The authors investigated the effect of various DAIs and CCIs on outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed 78 consecutive patients with DAI who were seen between May 2004 and March 2010. Outcome was evaluated using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (EGOS) 1 year after TBI. Patients with single DAIs had only 1 of the 3 lesions (lobar, CC, or brainstem). Patients with dual DAIs had 2 of these lesions, and those with triple DAIs had all of these lesions. Furthermore, the authors defined single, dual, and triple CCIs by using 3 lesions (genu, body, splenium) in the same way among patients with single (CC) DAIs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between these lesions and outcome in patients with DAI. Results. Fifty patients had single DAIs: 34 in the lobar area, 11 in the CC, and 5 in the brainstem. Twenty had dual DAIs, and 8 had triple DAIs. Of the 11 CCIs, 9 were single and 2 were dual CCIs. Among these lesions, only those in the genu were related to disability. The authors dichotomized patients into those with and without genu lesions, regardless of other injuries.

Role of serum biomarkers in individuals in coma orvegetative stateafter traumatic brain injury,Mondello S.; Gabrielli A.; Catani S.; D'Ippolito M.; Tortella F.; Schmidt K.; Hayes R.L.; Wang K.K.; Formisano R. ,"Background: Several studies have shown that blood biomarker levels in the acute and subacute phases after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be diagnostic and prognostic tools in addition to clinical indices. However, the role of brain damage biomarkers in the chronic phase after TBIhas not been examined. The purpose of our study was to evaluate serum concentrations of two brain-specific biomarkers-microtubule- associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-in patients in coma or vegetative state following severe TBI, and to analyze their relationships with clinical characteristics. Method(s): We analyzed 28 adult post-acute TBIpatients. Mean interval from injury was 2.73 months (SD +/- 2.03 months). One hundred seventy-six healthy blood donors served as controls. Serum MAP-2 and GFAP levels were measured by quantitative ELISA on admission in the rehabilitation department. Data collected included demographic and clinical variables. Basal level of consciousness was assessed using the level of cognitive functioning (LCF), and functional baseline was measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS).

Cortical spreading depolarizations are a novel mechanism independently associated with unfavorable clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury,Hartings J.; Bullock R.; Okonkwo D.; Murray L.; Murray G.; Fabricius M.; Maas A.; Woitzik J.; Sakowitz O.; Mathern B.; Roozenbeek B.; Lingsma H.; Dreier J.; Puccio A.; Shutter L.; Pahl C.; Strong A. ,"INTRODUCTION: There are presently no neuroprotective drugs with efficacy to improve outcomes after traumatic brain injury, reflecting in part a lack of appropriate mechanistic endpoints. Spreading depolarizations are a novel pathology of cerebral gray matter that recur spontaneously in the areas surrounding injury foci. Here we investigate whether spreading depolarizations are associated with worse neurologic outcome, independent of known prognostic factors. METHOD(S): 103 adult patients who required neurosurgery for treatment of acute traumatic brain injury were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. Spreading depolarizations were monitored by electrocorticography during intensive care. Six-month neurologic outcomes were assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and fitted to a multivariable model using ordinal regression. Prognostic scores based on conventional outcome predictors and categorical scoring of depolarizations were assessed as predictors. RESULT(S): A total 1,328 spreading depolarizations occurred in 58 of 103 patients. In 38 patients, all depolarizations were accompanied by cortical spreading depression (CSD). In 20 patients, spreading depolarizations occurred in isoelectric cortex (ISD). In multivariable analysis, both prognostic score and depolarization category (none, CSD, ISD) were significantly associated with neurologic outcome (p's < 0.001). CSDs and ISDs were associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcome (common odds ratios 1.56 and 7.58, respectively). Adding depolarization scoring to the regression model increased the explained variance in outcome from 9% to 22%. CONCLUSION(S): These results suggest that monitoring for spreading depolarizations adds prognostic value beyond the conventional predictors of outcome available at hospital admission. Because they are a causative factor in lesion development under certain conditions, depolarizations may further serve as a mechanistic endpoint for monitoring and treatment in brain trauma and possibly other acute brain injuries.",2011,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,28,6,A3-A4,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2011.9945,70479687,#24220,Hartings 2011,,maybe
Response to intracranial hypertension treatment as a predictor of death in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: Clinical article,Farahvar A.; Gerber L.M.; Chiu Y.-L.; Hartl R.; Carney N.; Ghajar J. ,"Object. The normalization of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is assumed to limit secondary brain injury and improve outcome. Despite evidence-based recommendations for monitoring and treatment of elevated ICP, there are few studies that show an association between response to ICP-directed therapeutic regimens and adjusted mortality rate. This study utilizes a large prospective database to examine the effect of response to ICP-lowering therapy on risk of death within the first 2 weeks of injury in patients who sustained TBI and are older than 16 years. Methods. The current study is based on 1426 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score < 9) of whom 388 were treated for elevated ICP (> 25 mm Hg) between 2000 and 2008 at 22 trauma centers enrolled in a New York State quality improvement program. This prospectively collected database also contains information including age, admission GCS score, pupillary status, CT scanning parameters, and hypotension, which are all known early prognostic indicators of death. Treatment of elevated ICP consisted of administration of mannitol, hypertonic saline, barbiturates, and/or drainage of CSF or decompressive craniectomy. The factors predicting ICP response to treatment and predicting death at 2 weeks were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Results. Increasing age and fewer hours of elevated ICP on Day 1 were found to be significant predictors (p = 0.001 and 0.0003, respectively) of a positive response to treatment. Response to ICP-lowering therapy (p = 0.03), younger age (p < 0.0001), fewer hours of elevated ICP (p < 0.0001), and absence of arterial hypotension on Day 1 (p = 0.001) significantly predicted reduced risk of death. Conclusions. Patients who responded to ICP-lowering treatment had a 64% lower risk of death at 2 weeks than those who did not respond after adjusting for factors that independently predict risk of death.

"A population-based, inception cohort study of the incidence and prognosis of mild traumatic brain injury after motor vehicle collisions",Cassidy J.D.; Boyle E.; Carroll L. ,"Objectives: Traffic collisions are an important cause of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), yet there are few studies of its incidence and prognosis. In particular, there are few population-based studies with patient-centred outcomes. Therefore, we completed an incidence cohort of traffic injuries and followed their outcomes over one year. The objectives are to determine the incidence, course and prognosis for patients with MTBI. Method(s): A population-based, incidence cohort of all adult traffic injuries (N=8,634) occurring between December 1, 1997 and November 30, 1999 was formed in Saskatchewan, a Canadian province of approximately 1 million residents. Saskatchewan residents have universal government health care and traffic insurance. All adult residents who were treated by a regulated health professional for a traffic injury are included in the cohort. We excluded motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian injuries and patients who claimed an injury more than 42 days after the collision. Baseline data from all eligible subjects (n=7,170) were available from insurance claims forms, including socio-demographics, collision factors, injury symptoms, pain, depression, initial healthcare, comorbid disease, general health, previous injury, and work status. Participants were followed over one year by computer-aided telephone interviews with less than 20% attrition. MTBI was defined by self-report of hitting the head during collision impact and the presence of one or more of confusion, amnesia, dizziness, forgetfulness, LOC (<= 30 minutes) and/or loss of concentration. Selfreported recovery was measured at six weeks, three, six, nine and twelve months after injury. We determined the incidence of MTBI per 100,000 adult population and estimated the associations between baseline prognostic factors and time-to-recovery using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Result(s): Of the 7,170 eligible study subjects, 1,716 (24%) suffered a MTBI with an incidence of 118.3 per 100,000 person-years. The age-specific incidence decreased with increasing age varying from 252.3 per 100,000 in those 18-23 years of age to 63.8 per 100,000 in those>=50 years. The incidence was slightly higher for females (124.3 per 100,000) compared to males (112.2 per 100,000). The median time to self-reported recovery was 97 days. Baseline factors associated with not recovering included lower education, poor prior health, poor expectation for recovery, more depressive symptoms, higher pain intensity, presence of confusion, presence of numbness and presence of hearing problems. LOC<=30 minutes was reported by 859 (50%) of the 1,716 subjects with MTBI and was not associated with recovery. Conclusion(s): Traffic injuries account for a substantial proportion of treated MTBI in the general population. About half of the injured are recovered by 3 months. Delayed recovery is associated with a mix of biopsychosocial factors, but not by the presence of LOC.",2012,/,Brain Injury,26,05-Apr,650,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.660091,70732037,#24025,Cassidy 2012,,maybe
FDG PET/CT in traumatic brain injury,Rao J.; Nallapareddy K.; Chengapa A.A. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) forms a major part of neurological practice and is often causes diagnostic and ethical dilemma. About 25% of these patients may die and about 40% will have permanent deficits. CT and MRI are indicated in the acute setting, particularly CT due to cost and convenience. PET not usually performed in the acute setting may be useful in long term management by aiding in prognostication. We present our experience in evaluating these patients with FDG PET/CT. Aim(s): To evaluate the role of FDG PET/CT in the management of traumatic brain injury. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of reports of five patients with traumatic brain injury with subacute and chronic history scanned between March 2008 and November 2011 was done. Pediatric and adults scans were included in the study. Patients were scanned 4 hours after intravenous injection of 18F FDG. Reporting of scans was done by a radiologist and PET physician. Follow up was obtained where possible. Result(s): There was sparing of right frontal, parietal and both occipital lobes in the first patient with severe hypometabolism in the rest of the brain and no significant CT abnormality. Bilateral symmetric mild hypometabolism was seen the second patient (CT showed mild cortical atrophy). The third patient showed severe left cerebral hemisphere hypometabolism with right cerebellar diaschisis. Severe hypometabolism was noted in the left cerebral hemisphere and moderate in the right temporal, occipital lobes and thalamus with a left subdural hematoma. The fifth patient showed bilateral temporal, occipital, left frontal bilateral thalamic and cerebellar hypometabolism. Only mild hypometabolism was noted in the parietal lobes, CT showing a left fronto parietal depressed fracture. Conclusion(s): In the small number of patients with TBI, FDG PET showed different patterns and degrees of hypometabolism which likely helped in prognostication. It may be considered in the work up of such patients although; larger studies are required for more definitive data.

Our study evaluated the impact of TBI on the quality of life (QoL) during the first five years following a road accident. Methods.- A prospective study was carried out among 957 injured road accident victims, aged > 16 years, and living in the Rhone Department, France. QoL was repeatedly measured at 1, 3, and 5 years after the road accident using the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). The raw score of the overall quality of life, general health facet, physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment domains vary from 4 to 20; higher scores reflect better quality of life. All the analyses were performed using the hierarchical mixed models. Results.- Overall, 22.7% of the injured road accident victims were categorized as TBI at inclusion. TBI was associated with the overall QoL and social relationships scores during the first five years following the road accident.

Method(s): MRI protocol included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and was performed for 32 patients with moderate TBI and 32 matched control subjects. Regions of interests were applied in the FA maps in the corpus callosum, internal capsules posterior limb, and cerebral peduncles. Results were compared in patients with motor power affection and patients without motor power affection to the control group. Result(s): All patients had FA values lower than the control group with significance differences in the corpus callosum. Patient group with weakness had FA values lower than the control groups with significance differences in the posterior limb of the left internal capsules (p = 0.001) and left cerebral peduncles (p < 0.001). Significant differences were found when comparing the posterior limb of the left internal capsule (p = 0.002) and left cerebral peduncle (p = 0.022) to the right side in the weakness group.

Factors that influence functional mobility outcomes of patients after traumatic brain injury,Haffejee S.; Ntsiea V.; Mudzi W. ,"SummaryObjective/Background The consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) include physical, cognitive, psychological, behavioural, and emotional deficits. Prognostic factors such as age, mechanism of injury, and severity of injury assist in determining the outcome of the patient. It is believed that predictors of recovery assist both the patient as well as family members in determining the potential outcomes for the patient. The objective of this study was to identify factors that influence functional mobility outcome of patients after TBI. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were assessed predischarge. The Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was noted to establish the severity of the TBI. The Rivermead Mobility Index was used to establish the functional mobility outcome. Results The sample consisted of 60 participants of which 56 (93%) were males. The average age of the participants in the study was 28 +/- 8.5 years. More than 50% of the participants were unable to walk outside and 37% were able to climb a flight of stairs without help at the time of discharge from the hospital. Younger age (p <.001), male gender (p =.001), Grade 12 education (p =.001), being self employed (p <.001), having bowel and bladder continence (p <.001), not smoking and drinking (p <.001), and having occupational therapy sessions (p =.002) had a positive impact on function after TBI.

"""Immune markers of inflammation in TBI""",Morganti-Kossmann M.C. ,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disease to diagnose, treat and prognosticate. Much effort aims to identify biomarkers of brain injury to refine the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI. Biomarkers are defined as CNS proteins, released into blood and CSF following injury, which correlate with injury severity, neuroimaging findings and outcome. Although not brain-specific, inflammatory mediators have been investigated as potential biomarkers of TBI mostly due to their ability to exacerbate neurological damage or sustain repair. Cytokines are released within minutes following TBI to initiate, progress and terminate the inflammatory response. Several groups correlated cytokines measured in serum, plasma, CSF and microdialysates with GCS, ICP, TBI classification, GOS(E), mortality and BBB dysfunction. Although much endeavor exists to validate cytokines as biomarkers of TBI, the findings are sparse and often contradictory. Many groups have found no significant associations with clinical parameters, while others have shown that IL-6 and IL-8 and IL-10 correlate with mortality in both adults and pediatric TBI; Thresholds of IL-6 in plasma differentiate severe TBI whereas early IL-6 predicts ICP elevation. TNF was reported to correlate with higher ICP and lower CPP. IL-1 measured within 6 hours correlates with GCS and has been linked to poor outcome and increased ICP. The novel approach using IL-1/IL-1ra ratios in microdialysates revealed to predict favourable outcome; however the broad practicality of this method remains questionable. In this presentation, clinical studies on cytokine-related work will be discussed and related to experimental findings to highlight similarities and differences in cytokine research.",2014,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,31,5,A47-A48,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2014.9937,71400131,#23451,Morganti-Kossmann 2014,,maybe
Contralateral and third ventricular compression are early CT signs heralding secondary infarcts in non-penetrating severe traumatic brain injury,Rabai F.; Mahanna E.B.; Gabrielli A.; Hayes R.L.; Robertson C.S.; Robicsek S.A.; Schmalfuss I. ,"Posttraumatic secondary infarction (PTCI) is a common secondary injury following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Several risk factors for PTCI have been identified including low admission GCS, raised ICP, herniation and decompression surgery but no known early CT signs predicting PTCI have been identified yet. Existing CT classifications (e.g., Marshall Classification and Rotterdam Score) predict overall prognosis, but have not been validated for predicting PTCI. We aimed to identify early CT signs as risk factors of PTCI. A prospective convenience controlled cohort study enrolled 131 adult patients with sTBI. CT scans were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of secondary infarcts, third ventricular compression, contralateral ventricular compression in relation to primary mass lesion, intra-ventricular hemorrhage, basal and cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with and without secondary infarcts. Fifteen of 131 patients (11.4%) developed secondary infarcts. Third ventricular compression and contralateral ventricular compression on initial CT scan was seen more frequently in patients with PTCI: 14/15 vs 55/116 (OR = 15.5; 95%CI 1.98-121.98 p < 0.01) and 10/15 vs 20/ 116 (OR = 9.6; 95%CI 2.96-31.14 p < 0.01), respectively. Contralateral and 3rd ventricular compression were found to correlate with the development of PTCI. These CT signs can be considered as surrogate markers of CSF volume loss, an early compensatory step in intracranial swelling often seen in sTBI. Subsequent rise in ICP can lead to herniation, vessel compression and ultimately secondary infarcts. Identification of these early CT signs may lead to intensified treatment and to reduced risk of secondary infarcts.",2014,/,Journal of Neurotrauma,31,5,A67,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2014.9937,71400191,#23450,Rabai 2014,,maybe
Bilateral fixed dilated pupils in trauma-To operate or not to operate?,Hendrickson S.; Scotter J.; Marcus H.J.; Sikander M.; Arnold F.; Wilson M.H. ,"Objectives: Bilateral fixed dilated pupils (BFDP) in patients with traumatic intracranial haematomas are widely recognized as an ominous sign suggestive of herniation and brainstem injury. A recent retrospective cohort analysis, for example, reported a mortality rate of 82.0% in patients with BFDP. Given such a dismal prognosis many patients with BFDP are currently managed conservatively. The aim of this study was to determine which patients, if any, might benefit from aggressive surgical evacuation of their haematoma. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study design was adopted. All patients admitted to a Major Trauma Centre from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2013 were reviewed. This study included adult patients with head injury that presented with BFDP and also had radiological evidence of a traumatic haematoma resulting in significant mass effect. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, radiological findings, operative procedures and outcomes were recorded. Result(s): In all, 2146 admissions were reviewed, of which 47 patients had BFDP and 20 also had a traumatic haematoma (19 with acute subdural haematoma and one with an acute extradural haematoma). The mean age was 50 years (range=17-86 years), the male:female ratio was 16:5 and the median Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on presentation was 3 (range=3-6). All six patients that were not operated on died. Of the 14 patients that underwent surgical evacuation of their traumatic haematoma, six died (42.9%), and one patient had a favourable outcome (7.1%). Notably, the patient that made a good recovery was 30 years of age and underwent surgical evacuation within 30 minutes of his pupils becoming dilated and unreactive. Conclusion(s): Patients with head injury presenting with BFDP are likely to have suffered devastating brain damage, but a good outcome is possible in very selected cases. These findings support those of the existing neurotrauma literature and suggest that patients that are young and those that undergo rapid surgical evacuation may be more likely to benefit from aggressive therapy.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,728,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445380,#23433,Hendrickson 2014,,maybe
Repeated acute and sub-acute event-related potentials as predictor of post-acute outcome: Presentation of a study design and single case data,Hauger S.L.; Olafsen K.; Andelic N.; Roe C.; Andersson S.; Schanke A.-K.; Becker F.; Schnakers C.; Lovstad M. ,"Objectives: Predicting outcome following severe TBI remains challenging. Electroencephalography-based Event Related Potentials (ERPs) recorded in the sub-acute phase have potential predictive value. It is, however, unknown whether the rate of ERP normalization can provide predictive information for post-acute outcome. This study describes a prospective study design investigating the prognostic value of repeated sub-acute ERPs in predicting post-acute functional outcome. Data collection started in October 2013 and acute ERP data from the first included patient are presented. Method(s): Inclusion criteria for patients recruited from the neurointensive care unit (NICU) at the largest Norwegian Trauma Referral Centre are (1) ICD-10 diagnosis of intracranial injury (S06.1-S06.9), (2) severe TBI (GCS<= 8) in the first 24 hours after injury, (3) in need of more than 5 days of intensive care and (4) withdrawn infused sedation (>= 4 days). ERPs will be recorded at three time-points, using an auditory design with repeated exposure to the patient's own name (SON) or an unfamiliar name (UN), with tasks varying from passive listening to requirement of volitional cognition (counting the number of SON). Data are collected bed-side using a 32 electrodes cap and a portable NuAmp EEG-amplifier. Acute medical data will be registered and behavioural function assessed with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R). Outcome at 6 months will be assessed with standardized questionnaires and neuropsychological measures. Result(s): The ERPs of the first patient included were recorded 28 days post-injury in a minimally conscious female still admitted to the NICU (aged 53). ERP-data were compared to nine healthy subjects (six males, mean age=35). GCS and CRS-R total score at the day of recordings was 12 and 16, respectively, displaying intermittant but not consistent command following. The patient displayed an identifiable N1-P2 complex and, more importantly, a parietal P300 component, indicating attentional processing. Compared to the control group, the patient's P300 was delayed and had reduced amplitude. The P300 was of a longer temporal duration and had higher frontal amplitude in the active counting condition than in the passive listening task. However, the control group did not present with a clear P300 in the passive listening task, indicating a deficient task differentiation in the patient. Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from the first patient included in this prognostic ERP study validate that reliable electrophysiological indicators of attentional processing can be demonstrated in a functional imaging task with working memory load in a TBI patient admitted to NICU, who behaviourally displayed inconsistent command following. The highly preliminary results indicate that the design is suitable for investigation of residual cognition in severely brain injured patients still receiving intensive care treatment and that electrophysiological data adds information not conveyed by behavioural methods.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,736,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445398,#23429,Hauger 2014,,maybe

Method(s): The Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation leads the Strategy, working with over 70 stakeholder organizations and provincial experts. Five working groups were created to address priority themes in a co-ordinated manner: (1) Recognition and Awareness, (2) Diagnosis and Early Education, (3) Evaluation of Access to Care, (4) Management of Persistent Symptoms and (5) Psychosocial and Reintegration. Three annual Summits (2011-2013) have been held to update on progress, share results and prioritize next steps. Result(s): A framework was created to integrate the elements of concussion/mTBI care from point of injury to successful return-toactivity and to identify gaps and flow challenges. Collaboration is occurring with Ontario Ministries of Health, Education and Sports to improve concussion management in schools. A tool was created to assist coaches, teachers, parents, students and athletic therapists/ trainers regarding concussion in school and return-to-learn and play. Adult guidelines were updated and released in 2013 and paediatric guidelines for management of persistent symptoms are being developed for 2014. Surveys on clinician knowledge and practice regarding concussion diagnosis and management provide guidance for implementing best practice and standards of care. Research on incidence has identified over 200 000 individuals with concussions per year in Ontario. This information, along with referrals and availability of concussion clinics is guiding work on access and services. A review of prognostic factors for good and poor recovery has identified several areas for further research and will guide practice and policy. Return-to-work and school are being addressed through development of practice guides. The 3rd Summit assessed the state of knowledge and resulted in priorities for implementation. Conclusion(s): Concussions are a serious public health issue and current access to care in Ontario is variable. Current concussion care does not reflect the ideal concussion care and there are areas for improvement in the recognition, diagnosis and management of concussion/mTBI. The strategy aims to ensure that children, youth and adults that are diagnosed with a concussion are able to access appropriate treatment and fully reintegrate back into the community.",2014,/,Brain Injury,28,06-May,780,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2014.892379,71445508,#23427,Bayley 2014,,maybe
Fractional anisotropy helps predicts memory rehabilitation outcome after traumatic brain injury.,"Strangman, Gary E; O'Neil-Pirozzi, Therese M; Supelana, Christina; Goldstein, Richard; Katz, Douglas I; Glenn, Mel B","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly results in residual memory difficulties. Such deficits are amenable to cognitive rehabilitation, but optimal selection of rehabilitation interventions remains a challenge. We hypothesized that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could be used to predict which individuals were likely to benefit from a specific memory rehabilitation intervention. Thirty-seven individuals with TBI, of all severities, first underwent DTI scanning, along with 18 matched controls. Participants with TBI then attended a 12-session memory intervention emphasizing internal memory strategies (I-MEMS). Primary outcome measures (HVLT, RBMT) were collected at the time of DTI scanning, and both immediately and one month post-therapy. In contrast to typical neuroimaging analysis, fractional anisotropy (FA) was used to predict long-term outcome scores, adjusting for typical predictors (injury severity, age, education, time since injury, pretest score). FA of the parahippocampal white matter was a significant negative predictor of HVLT, while the anterior corpus callosum, left anterior internal capsule, and right anterior corona radiata were negative predictors of RBMT outcome. The importance of these predictors rivaled those of pretest scores. Thus, FA measures may provide substantial predictive value for other cognitive interventions as well. The reason why higher FA was associated with less successful response to cognitive intervention remains unclear and will require further study.",2012,/,NeuroRehabilitation,31,3,295-310,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/NRE-2012-0797,23093456,#8608,Strangman 2012,,maybe
Procalcitonin as a marker of sepsis and outcome in patients with neurotrauma: an observation study.,"Deng, Shuixiang; Zhu, Hechen; Wang, Kunlun; Cao, Tongwa","BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a reliable biomarker of sepsis and infection. The level of PCT associated with sepsis and infection in patients with traumatic brain injury is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) as diagnostic markers of sepsis and to evaluate the prognostic value of these markers related to the severity of injury, sepsis and mortality., METHODS: 105 adult patients with neurotrauma were enrolled in this study from June 2011 to February 2013. PCT and CRP were measured at admission and 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after admission. The sepsis criteria established by American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference were used to identify patients. Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were used to assess the severity of the injury. All these patients were monitored for 28 days., RESULTS: At admission, the median level of PCT was consistent with the severity of brain injury as follows: mild 0.08 ng/ml (0.05 - 0.13), moderate 0.25 ng/ml (0.11 - 0.55) and severe 0.31 ng/ml (0.17 - 0.79), but the range of CRP levels varied greatly within the given severity of brain injury. Seventy-one (67.6%) patients developed sepsis. The initial levels of PCT at admission were statistically higher in patients with sepsis, compared with patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), but there were no differences in the initial concentration of CRP between sepsis and SIRS. After adjusting for these parameters, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was an independent risk factor for septic complications (p < 0.05). The areas under the ROCs at admission for the prediction of mortality were 0.76 (p < 0.05) and 0.733 for PCT and CRP, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PCT during the course of the ICU stay could be an important indicator for the early diagnosis of sepsis after neurotrauma. In addition, high serum levels of PCT in patients with neurotrauma at admission indicate an increased risk of septic complications, and the daily measurement of PCT assists in guiding antibiotic therapy in neurotrauma patients.",2013,/,BMC anesthesiology,13,1,48,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2253-13-48,24330775,#8567,Deng 2013,,maybe
Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following traumatic brain injury affects functional improvement during acute inpatient rehabilitation.,"Rosario, Emily R; Aqeel, Rubina; Brown, Meghan A; Sanchez, Gabriel; Moore, Colleen; Patterson, David","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to determine its effect on functional improvement in acute inpatient rehabilitation., METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified male patients with a primary diagnosis of TBI with or without a skull fracture, an onset date within 6 months prior to admission, and were 16 years of age or older. The percentage of individuals in this population with abnormal hormone levels was determined on the basis of the established normal reference range for each hormone assay. The functional independence measure, which assesses functional outcomes in acute inpatient rehabilitation, was used to examine the relationship between hormone levels and functional improvement., RESULTS: Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was identified in nearly 70% of men following TBI. Hypogonadism, or low testosterone levels, was observed in 66% of the patients, followed by low levels of free T4 in 46% and low levels of insulin growth factor-1 in 26% of patients.

The initial ICP and the duration of intracranial hypertension (ICH) were calculated. The risk factors associated with the development of ALI and SIRS were evaluated., RESULTS: Of the 86 patients enrolled, 22 patients developed ALI and 52 patients developed SIRS during the observation period. The patients with ALI presented with a significantly higher initial ICP (31.3+/-7.8 mmHg vs. 23.0+/-8.8 mmHg, p<0.001) and a longer duration of ICH (16.8+/-6.5 h vs. 11.9+/-6.0 h, p=0.002) than those without ALI. The incidence of both ALI and SIRS increased with increasing initial ICP, and the presence of SIRS was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of developing ALI (odds ratio [OR], 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-13.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Increased ICP is associated with increased risks of developing ALI and SIRS following severe TBI.

"The epidemiology, prognosis, and trends of severe traumatic brain injury with presenting Glasgow Coma Scale of 3.","Salottolo, Kristin; Carrick, Matthew; Stewart Levy, A; Morgan, Brent C; Slone, Denetta S; Bar-Or, David","PURPOSE: To characterize trends and prognosis of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHODS: This 5-year multicenter retrospective study included patients with TBI and Glasgow Coma Scale of 3. We analyzed demographic and clinical characteristics and mortality using Pearson chi2 tests, Cochran-Armitage trend tests, and stepwise logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by vehicular and fall etiologies; other etiologies were excluded (24%)., RESULTS: Included were 481 patients. Fall-related injuries increased 58% (P=.001) but vehicular etiology did not change (P=.63). The characteristics of the populations changed over time; with falls, the population became older and increasingly presented with normal vital signs, whereas with vehicular etiology, the population became younger, with more alcohol-related injury (P<.05 for all). Mortality from falls increased substantially from 25% to 63% (P<.001), whereas death from vehicular injures remained statistically unchanged but with a downward trend (50%-38%, P=.28). Predictors of mortality included injury severity and age at least 65 years for both groups. Additional variables that were prognostic were abnormal vital signs and subdural hematoma for vehicular injuries, and sex for fall injuries., CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of severe TBI is changing.

Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death., RESULTS: Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25).

Predicting Mortality and Independence at Discharge in the Aging Traumatic Brain Injury Population Using Data Available at Admission.,"Miller, Preston R; Chang, Michael C; Hoth, J Jason; Hildreth, Amy N; Wolfe, Stacey Q; Gross, Jessica L; Martin, R Shayn; Carter, Jeffrey E; Meredith, J Wayne; D'Agostino, Ralph Jr","BACKGROUND: Aging worsens outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI), but available studies may not provide accurate outcomes predictions due to confounding associated injuries. Our goal was to develop a predictive tool using variables available at admission to predict outcomes related to severity of brain injury in aging patients., STUDY DESIGN: Characteristics and outcomes of blunt trauma patients, aged 50 or older, with isolated TBI, in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), were evaluated. Equations predicting survival and independence at discharge (IDC) were developed and validated using patients from our trauma registry, comparing predicted with actual outcomes., RESULTS: Logistic regression for survival and IDC was performed in 57,588 patients using age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), and Revised Trauma Score (RTS). All variables were independent predictors of outcome. Two models were developed using these data. The first included age, sex, and GCS. The second substituted RTS for GCS. C statistics from the models for survival and IDC were 0.90 and 0.82 in the GCS model. In the RTS model, C statistics were 0.80 and 0.67. The use of GCS provided better discrimination and was chosen for further examination. Using a predictive equation derived from the logistic regression model, outcome probabilities were calculated for 894 similar patients from our trauma registry (January 2012 to March 2016). The survival and IDC models both showed excellent discrimination (p < 0.0001). Survival and IDC generally decreased by decade: age 50 to 59 (80% IDC, 6.5% mortality), 60 to 69 (82% IDC, 7.0% mortality), 70 to 79 (76% IDC, 8.9% mortality), and 80 to 89 (67% IDC, 13.4% mortality)., CONCLUSIONS: These models can assist in predicting the probability of survival and IDC for aging patients with TBI.

Predicting posttraumatic hydrocephalus: derivation and validation of a risk scoring system based on clinical characteristics.,"Chen, Hao; Yuan, Fang; Chen, Shi-Wen; Guo, Yan; Wang, Gan; Deng, Zhi-Feng; Tian, Heng-Li","Posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) is a disorder of disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It can lead to brain metabolic impairment and dysfunction and has a high risk of clinical deterioration and worse outcomes. The incidence and risk factors for the development of PTH after decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been assessed in previous studies, but rare studies identify patients with higher risk for PTH among all TBI patients. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk scoring system to predict PTH after TBI. Demographics, injury severity, duration of coma, radiologic findings, and DC were evaluated to determine the independent predictors of PTH during hospitalization until 6 months following TBI through logistic regression analysis. A risk stratification system was created by assigning a number of points for each predictor and validated in an independent cohort. The model accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of 526 patients in the derivation cohort, 57 (10.84%) developed PTH during 6 months follow up. Age > 50 yrs (Odd ratio [OR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.75, 4 points), duration of coma >=1 w (OR = 5.68, 95% CI 2.57-13.47, 9 points), Fisher grade III (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.24-4.36, 5 points) or IV (OR = 3.87, 95% CI 1.93-8.43, 7 points), bilateral DC (OR = 6.13, 95% CI 2.82-18.14, 9 points), and extra herniation after DC (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.46-4.92, 5 points) were independently associated with PTH. Rates of PTH for the low- (0-12 points), intermediate- (13-22 points) and high-risk (23-34 points) groups were 1.16%, 35.19% and 78.57% (p < 0.0001). The corresponding rates in the validation cohort, where 17/175 (9.71%) developed PTH, were 1.35%, 37.50% and 81.82% (p < 0.0001). The risk score model exhibited good-excellent discrimination in both cohorts, with AUC of 0.839 versus 0.894 (derivation versus validation) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemshow p = 0.56 versus 0.68).

Posttraumatic Seizures in a Rural Nigerian Neurosurgical Service.,"Rabiu, Taopheeq Bamidele; Adetunmbi, Babatunde","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a recognized risk factor for seizures. In Nigeria, there is paucity of literature on posttraumatic seizure (PTS). This study provides the profile and pattern of PTS in patients with TBI in a rural Nigerian neurosurgical service., METHODS: A prospective observational study of patients with TBI was performed. Clinical and radiological data including outcomes of care were analyzed with SPSS version 15. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant., RESULTS: A total of 199 patients were managed for TBI. There were 20 (10.1%) cases of PTS. Mean age was 28.4 years (range: 5-80 years) and most were male (n = 16; 80%). The average admission Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 (range: 3-15). Of the 20 patients with PTS, 10 (50%) had mild head injury whereas 3 (15%) and 7 (35%) had moderate and severe head injuries, respectively. PTS peaked in young patients aged 17-45 years (n = 14, 70%). Fourteen (n = 14, 70%) had immediate PTS, whereas 6 (30%) had early PTS. Increasing severity of head injury resulted in a greater incidence of PTS (7.8%, 10.3%, and 17.1% for mild, moderate, and severe head injuries, respectively). Findings of acute subdural hematoma and contusions on computed tomography scan are significant risk factors for PTS (chi2: 22.8; P value: 0.0004). Five (25%) patients required anticonvulsant therapy because of seizure recurrence, but only one progressed to late PTS. Four (20.0%) died, whereas the rest had good outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI and computed tomography findings of acute subdural hematoma and cerebral contusions are predictors of PTS in our environment.

The relationship between alcohol and cognitive functioning following traumatic brain injury.,"Ponsford, Jennie; Tweedly, Laura; Taffe, John","The present study aimed to examine the association between frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption and cognitive functioning following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty moderately to severely injured individuals had completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to measure preinjury alcohol use soon after injury and were recruited and assessed with AUDIT and Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB), as a measure of frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption at 6-9 months post injury. Fifty participants completed both AUDIT and TLFB at a follow-up assessment at 12-15 months post injury. Measures of processing speed/attention, memory, and executive function were also administered. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between alcohol use and cognition at the two occasions of measurement. Harmful or hazardous alcohol use pre injury was associated with poorer memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and slower processing speed on Symbol Digit Modalities Test on average across postinjury measurement occasions, but not with executive functioning, measured by the Modified Six Elements Test (MSET) at 6-9 months post injury. On the other hand, executive functioning on MSET 6-9 months post injury was significantly poorer in participants who were consuming any alcohol at all in the month prior to follow-up assessment. The current study provides evidence showing that pre- and postinjury alcohol use is negatively associated with different aspects of cognitive functioning following TBI. In addition to providing some support for the provision of advice to abstain from alcohol after injury, these findings suggest that interventions to reduce postinjury alcohol use may be useful.",2013,/,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,35,1,103-12,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13803395.2012.752437,23339581,#8404,Ponsford 2013,,maybe
Frequency and impact of intensive care unit complications on moderate-severe traumatic brain injury: early results of the Outcome Prognostication in Traumatic Brain Injury (OPTIMISM) Study.,"Muehlschlegel, Susanne; Carandang, Raphael; Ouillette, Cynthia; Hall, Wiley; Anderson, Fred; Goldberg, Robert","BACKGROUND: Known predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with moderate-severe TBI (msTBI) explain only a relatively small proportion of patient-related outcomes. The frequency and impact of intensive care unit complications (ICU-COMPL) on msTBI-associated outcomes are poorly understood., METHODS: In 213 consecutive msTBI patients admitted to a Level I Trauma Center neuro trauma ICU, twenty-eight ICU-COMPL (21 medical and 7 neurological) were prospectively collected and adjudicated by group consensus, using pre-defined criteria. We determined frequencies, and explored associations of ICU-COMPL and hospital discharge outcomes using multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: The average age of the study sample was 53 years, and the median presenting Glasgow Coma Scale and Injury Severity Scores were 5 and 27, respectively. Hyperglycemia (79%), fever (62%), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (60%), and hypotension requiring vasopressors (42%) were the four most common medical ICU-COMPL. Herniation (39%), intracranial rebleed (39%), and brain edema requiring osmotherapy (37%) were the three most common neurological ICU-COMPL. After adjusting for admission variables, duration of ventilation, and ICU length-of-stay, patients with brain edema (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2, 16.7) had a significantly increased odds for dying during hospitalization whereas patients with hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) had a decreased odds (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.005, 0.6). Sensitivity analysis revealed that UTI occurred later, suggesting a non-causal association with survival. Brain herniation (OR 15.7; 95% CI 2.6, 95.4) was associated with an unfavorable functional status (GOS 1-3)., CONCLUSION: ICU-COMPL are very common after msTBI, have a considerable impact on short-term outcomes, and should be considered in the prognostication of these high risk patients.

Post-traumatic hydrocephalus after ventricular shunt placement in a Singaporean neurosurgical unit.,"Low, Chyi Yeu David; Low, Yin Yee Sharon; Lee, Kah Keow; Chan, Siew Pang; Ang, Beng Ti","Ventricular enlargement is a common finding after severe head injury and has a poor prognosis if associated with post-traumatic hydrocephalus (PTH). We retrospectively reviewed our head injury database and identified patients who suffered from severe head injury and subsequently had shunt insertion after a diagnosis of PTH. A total of 871 patients with severe head injury were admitted from April 1999 to December 2006. Twenty-three patients (2.6%) were diagnosed with post-traumatic hydrocephalus and had a shunt inserted. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, and unilateral and bilateral decompressive craniectomy, were significant predictors of PTH. The timing of shunt placement was between 2 weeks and 5 months post-head injury with a mean interval of 70 days. Three patients developed complications after shunt insertion. Seventeen patients (74%) achieved improvement after shunt insertion while the remainder had no significant change in neurological status. Eleven patients (48%) had improvements in their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of >=2 points, while six patients (26%) had a single-point improvement in their GCS score. At 1 year after shunting, 35% of patients had Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 3 to 4. PTH is a condition that has an insidious onset with varying clinical and radiological presentations. The incidence is low but there is a significant benefit from ventricular shunt insertion. The use of cerebrospinal fluid dynamic studies, in addition to clinical and radiological findings, has the potential for better diagnosis and management of these patients.

We compare this approach with analyses that rather account for clustering of patients within studies., STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of effect estimates from logistic regression models in real and simulated examples., RESULTS: The estimated prognostic effect of age in patients with traumatic brain injury is similar, regardless of whether clustering is accounted for. However, a family history of thrombophilia is found to be a diagnostic marker of deep vein thrombosis [odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.70; P = 0.05] when clustering is accounted for but not when it is ignored (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.37; P = 0.64).

Simulations show models accounting for clustering perform consistently well, but downwardly biased effect estimates and low coverage can occur when ignoring clustering., CONCLUSION: Researchers must routinely account for clustering in IPD meta-analyses; otherwise, misleading effect estimates and conclusions may arise.

Prolonged emergency department length of stay is not associated with worse outcomes in traumatic brain injury.,"Mejaddam, Ali Y; Elmer, Jonathan; Sideris, Antonios C; Chang, Yuchiao; Petrovick, Laurie; Alam, Hasan B; Fagenholz, Peter J","BACKGROUND: Data suggest that prolonged Emergency Department length of stay (EDLOS) has a detrimental effect on outcomes in some critically ill patients. However, the relationship between EDLOS and outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been examined., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effect of EDLOS on neurologic outcomes in TBI patients., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively identified cohort of patients with moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 9-13) and severe (GCS <= 8) TBI who presented to a Level 1 trauma center (2006-2010). Inclusion criteria were transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or operating room (OR) from the ED. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, a measure of neurologic function, at discharge. We used a proportional odds model to control for significant predictors of GOS in univariate analysis., RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients were included in the analysis, 77 (34%) of which were transferred to the OR. Median EDLOS was 3.3 h and 81.2% of patients had a GOS score <=3 (e.g., severe disability, vegetative, or deceased). In multivariable analyses, EDLOS was not associated with GOS score in either ICU bound (p = 0.57) or OR bound (p = 0.11) patients. Younger age, pupil reactivity, and absence of intubation were independent predictors of good outcomes in the ICU group. In OR patients, predictors of higher GOS score included presence of an epidural hemorrhage, absence of midline shift, and pupil reactivity., CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that EDLOS was not associated with poor outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI who required intensive care or early operative intervention in an academic Level 1 trauma center.

Timing and duration of intracranial hypertension versus outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Majdan, M; Mauritz, W; Wilbacher, I; Brazinova, A; Rusnak, M; Leitgeb, J","BACKGROUND: The goal of this paper was to investigate the association between patterns of intracranial hypertension (IH) and outcomes, to describe the treatment of patients with different patterns of IH, and to examine whether IH is an independent predictor of mortality and unfavourable outcome, respectively., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively in 9 central European centers is presented. 204 patients with severe TBI who had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring were coded as having either early (within first 2 days), late (after first 2 days), or no IH. IH was defined as >60 min of ICP >20 mmHg/day. The total number of hours/day of IH was recorded. Treatment was followed closely for the first 10 days using the therapy intensity level (TIL) score. Associations between types of IH and demographic factors, trauma severity, or treatment factors as well as outcomes were analysed., RESULTS: Patients in the early IH group were the most severely injured. They had the highest TIL levels, had the highest mortality (48%) and the highest rate of unfavourable outcome (65%) followed by the late IH group (20% and 57%) and the no IH group (23% and 36%). Duration of IH correlated significantly with hospital mortality. IH was an independent predictor of mortality and unfavourable outcome after adjusting for age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Abbreviated Injury Score ""head""., CONCLUSION: Intracranial hypertension with early onset is independently associated with significantly worse outcome in patients with severe TBI.

Does brain volume loss predict cognitive and narrative discourse performance following traumatic brain injury?.,"Le, Karen; Coelho, Carl; Mozeiko, Jennifer; Krueger, Frank; Grafman, Jordan","PURPOSE: In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between brain volume loss and performance on cognitive measures, including working memory, immediate memory, executive functions, and intelligence, and a narrative discourse production task. An underlying goal was to examine the prognostic potential of a brain lesion metric for discourse outcomes. It was hypothesized that brain volume loss would correlate with and predict cognitive and narrative discourse measures and have prognostic value for discourse outcomes., METHOD: One hundred sixty-seven individuals with penetrating head injury participated. Correlational and regression analyses were performed for the percentages of total brain and hemispheric volume loss and scores on 4 cognitive measures (WMS-III Working Memory and Immediate Memory primary indexes, D-KEFS Sorting Test, and WAIS-III Full Scale IQ) and 7 narrative discourse measures (T-units, grammatical complexity, cohesion, local and global coherence, story completeness, and story grammar)., RESULTS: The volumetric measures had significant small-to-moderate correlations with all cognitive measures but only one significant correlation with the discourse measures. Findings from regression analyses were analogous but revealed several models that approached significance., CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that an overall measure of brain damage may be more predictive of general cognitive status than of narrative discourse ability.

Detection of central white matter injury underlying vestibulopathy after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Alhilali, Lea M; Yaeger, Karl; Collins, Michael; Fakhran, Saeed","PURPOSE: To determine if central axonal injury underlies vestibulopathy and ocular convergence insufficiency after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) by using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Diffusion-tensor images were retrospectively reviewed in 30 patients with mild TBI and vestibular symptoms and 25 patients with mild TBI and ocular convergence insufficiency. Control subjects consisted of 39 patients with mild TBI without vestibular abnormalities and 17 patients with mild TBI and normal ocular convergence. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated as a measure of white matter integrity and were analyzed with TBSS regression analysis by using a general linear model. DTI abnormalities were correlated with symptom severity, neurocognitive test scores, and time to recovery with the Pearson correlation coefficient., RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, patients with mild TBI and vestibular symptoms had decreased neurocognitive test scores (P < .05) and FA values in the cerebellum and fusiform gyri (P < .05). Patients with ocular convergence insufficiency had diminished neurocognitive test scores (P < .05) and FA values in the right anterior thalamic radiation and right geniculate nucleus optic tracts (P < .0001). Cerebellar injury showed an inverse correlation with recovery time (R = -0.410, P = .02). Anterior thalamic radiation injury showed correlation with decreased processing speed (R = 0.402, P < .05)., CONCLUSION: DTI findings in patients with mild TBI and vestibulopathy support the hypothesis that posttraumatic vestibulopathy has a central axonal injury component. Peripheral vestibular structures were not assessed, and a superimposed peripheral contribution may exist. DTI evaluation of central vestibular structures may provide a diagnostic imaging tool in these patients and a quantitative biomarker to aid in prognosis.

Further, based on abnormal values in routine blood tests, the role of trauma-induced coagulopathy is analyzed in detail. Therefore, a prospective study of 153 TBI patients was completed at one institution between January 2008 and June 2012. The collected data included demographics, initial Glasgow Coma Scale pupillary response, initial and 6 h follow-up computed tomography scan findings, coagulation parameters (international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer and factor XIII), as well as outcome data using the modified Rankin score at discharge and after one year. The overall rate of early HPC within the first 6 h was 43.5%. The frequency of coagulopathy was 47.1%. When analyzing for risk factors that independently influenced outcome in the form of mRS >=4 at both points, the following variables appeared: elevated D-dimer level (>=10,000 mug/L), HPC, and initial brain contusions >=3 cm. Patients sustaining early HPC had a hazard ratio of 5.4 for unfavorable outcome at discharge (p=0.002) and of 3.9 after one year (p=0.006).

COMT Val158Met and cognitive and functional outcomes after traumatic brain injury.,"Willmott, Catherine; Withiel, Toni; Ponsford, Jennie; Burke, Richard","There is significant variability in long-term outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI), making accurate prognosis difficult. In seeking to enhance understanding of outcomes, this study aimed to investigate whether COMT Val(158)Met allele status was associated with performance on neuropsychological measures of attention and working memory, executive functioning, learning and memory, and speed of information processing in the early rehabilitation phase. The study also aimed to examine whether the COMT polymorphism was associated with longer-term functional outcomes. A total of 223 participants (71.3% male) with moderate-to-severe TBI were recruited as rehabilitation inpatients to participate in a prospective, longitudinal head injury outcome study. The three COMT genotype groups (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met) were well matched for estimated full-scale IQ, years of education, age at injury, and injury severity. Results showed no significant difference between genotypes on neuropsychological measures (all p>0.05) or functional outcome, as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), after controlling for age, education, and severity of injury. The presence of frontal lobe pathology was also not associated with cognitive performance. Those with greater injury severity (i.e., longer duration of post-traumatic amnesia) performed more poorly on measures of processing speed and verbal new learning and recall.

Does isolated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage merit a lower intensity level of observation than other traumatic brain injury?.,"Phelan, Herb A; Richter, Adam A; Scott, William W; Pruitt, Jeffrey H; Madden, Christopher J; Rickert, Kim L; Wolf, Steven E","Evidence is emerging that isolated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (ITSAH) may be a milder form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). If true, ITSAH may not benefit from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, which would, in turn, decrease resource utilization. We conducted a retrospective review of all TBI admissions to our institution between February 2010 and November 2012 to compare the presentation and clinical course of subjects with ITSAH to all other TBI. We then performed descriptive statistics on the subset of ITSAH subjects presenting with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13-15. Of 698 subjects, 102 had ITSAH and 596 had any other intracranial hemorrhage pattern. Compared to all other TBI, ITSAH had significantly lower injury severity scores (p<0.0001), lower head abbreviated injury scores (p<0.0001), higher emergency department GCS (p<0.0001), shorter ICU stays (p=0.007), higher discharge GCS (p=0.005), lower mortality (p=0.003), and significantly fewer head computed tomography scans (p<0.0001). Of those ITSAH subjects presenting with a GCS of 13-15 (n=77), none underwent placement of an intracranial monitor or craniotomy. One subject (1.3%) demonstrated a change in exam (worsened headache and dizziness) concomitant with a progression of his intracranial injury. His symptoms resolved with readmission to the ICU and continued observation. Our results suggest that ITSAH are less-severe brain injuries than other TBI. ITSAH patients with GCS scores of 13-15 demonstrate low rates of clinical progression, and when progression occurs, it resolves without further intervention.

Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage due to motor vehicle crash versus fall from height: a 4-year epidemiologic study.,"Parchani, Ashok; El-Menyar, Ayman; Al-Thani, Hassan; El-Faramawy, Ahmed; Zarour, Ahmad; Asim, Mohammad; Latifi, Rifat","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is difficult to estimate the real incidence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (TSAH). Although TSAH after trauma is associated with poor prognoses, the impact of mechanism of injury (MOI) and the pathophysiology remains unknown. We hypothesized that outcome of TSAH caused by motor vehicle crash (MVC) or fall from height (FFH) varies based on the MOI., METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from a prospectively created database registry in the section of Trauma Surgery at Hamad General Hospital between January 2008 and July 2012. All patients presented with head trauma and TSAH were included. Patient data included age, gender, nationality, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), types of head injuries, and associated injuries. Ventilator days, intensive care unit length of stay, pneumonia, and mortality were also studied., RESULTS: A total of 1665 patients with TBI were identified, of them 403 had TSAH with a mean age of 35 +/- 15 years. Of them 93% were male patients and 86% were expatriates. MVC (53%) and FFH (35%) were the major mechanisms of injury. The overall mean ISS and head abbreviated injury score were 19 +/- 10.6 and 3.4 +/- 0.96, respectively. Patients in MVC group sustained severe TSAH, had significantly greater head abbreviated injury score (3.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.9; P = 0.009) and ISS (21.6 +/- 10.6 vs. 15.9 +/- 9.5; P = 0.001), and lower scene Glasgow coma scale (10.8 +/- 4.8 vs. 13.2 +/- 3.4; P = 0.001) compared with the FFH group. In addition, the MVC group sustained more intraventricular hemorrhage (4.7 vs. 0.7; P = 0.001) and diffuse axonal injury (4.2 vs. 2.9; P = 0.001). In contrast, extradural hemorrhage (14.3% vs. 11.6%; P = 0.008) was higher in the FFH group. Lower extremities (14% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.004) injury was mainly associated with the MVC group. The overall mortality was 19 % among patients with TSAH. The mortality rate was higher in the MVC group when compared with the FFH group (24% vs. 10%; P = 0.001). In both groups, ISS and Glasgow coma scale at the scene were independent predictors of mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TSAH have a higher mortality rate. In this population, MVCs are associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality. Therefore, prevention of MVC and fall can reduce the incidence and severity of TBI in Qatar.

Its level is up-regulated following various insults of the CNS in animal models. A few studies have documented alterations of PACAP levels in human serum. The time course of post-ictal PACAP levels, for example, show correlation with migraine severity. Very little is known about the course of PACAP levels following CNS injury in humans and the presence of PACAP has not yet been detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects with severe TBI (sTBI). The aim of the present study was to determine whether PACAP occurs in the CSF and plasma (Pl) of patients that suffered sTBI and to establish a time course of PACAP levels in the CSF and Pl. Thirty eight subjects with sTBI were enrolled with a Glasgow Coma Scale <=8 on admission. Samples were taken daily, until the time of death or for maximum 10 days. Our results demonstrated that PACAP was detectable in the CSF, with higher concentrations in patients with TBI. PACAP concentrations markedly increased in both Pl and CSF in the majority of patients 24-48h after the injury stayed high thereafter. In cases of surviving patients, Pl and CSF levels displayed parallel patterns, which may imply the damage of the blood-brain barrier. However, in patients, who died within the first week, Pl levels were markedly higher than CSF levels, possibly indicating the prognostic value of high Pl PACAP levels. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

[The histological confirmation of diffuse axonal injury in severe brain injury survivors].,"Woischneck, D; Kapapa, T; Scheuerle, A; Schutze, M; Pauli, S","Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) plays a major role after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Its imaging is based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, DAI is a histological diagnosis. Histopathological findings on survival after TBI are very rare. Hence, it is unclear whether the neuroradiological findings are of clinical relevance. Cerebral specimens were taken in 24 patients with TBI requiring surgery. The presence of histopathological evidence for DAI was evaluated. Specimens were taken from an extracranial brain prolapse (n = 2) and from peripheral parts of a brain contusion (n = 22). Histological findings were correlated to the clinical course and the neurological status. A clinical follow-up was carried out 6 months after the surgery using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Specimens taken were temporal (n = 11), frontal (n = 8), parietal (n = 4) and cerebellar (n = 1). The incidence of DAI within these specimens was 30% (7 with DAI, 17 without DAI). DAI was verifiable up to 3 days after trauma. There was no correlation between DAI and Marshall classification in CT. The period of coma was longer in subjects with DAI. There was no difference in GOS in the case of a verified DAI. These results enforce the prognostic and neuroradiologic relevance of DAI. However, it is debatable whether the pathomorphologic findings in CT or MRI represent the histological findings of DAI.

Is Sex an Indicator of Prognosis After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Analysis of the Findings of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and the International Collaboration on Mild Traumatic,"Cancelliere, Carol; Donovan, James; Cassidy, J David","OBJECTIVE: To determine sex differences in the recovery and prognosis after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in adults and children., DATA SOURCES: We analyzed all scientifically admissible primary studies in the World Health Organization (WHO) (n=120) and International Collaboration on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Prognosis (ICoMP) (n=101) systematic reviews regarding prognosis of MTBI for sex-stratified findings. They searched MEDLINE and other databases from 1980 through 2000 (WHO) and 2001 through 2012 (ICoMP) for published, peer-reviewed reports in English and other languages., STUDY SELECTION: We selected controlled trials and cohort and case-control studies that assessed the effect of sex on outcomes after MTBI., DATA EXTRACTION: Data from the eligible studies from both systematic reviews combined (n=14, 7%) were extracted into evidence tables., DATA SYNTHESIS: Prognostic information relating to sex was prioritized according to design as exploratory or confirmatory, and a best-evidence synthesis was conducted. After MTBI, females may have a higher risk of epilepsy (children, young adults) and suicide, and use more health care services; males may be at higher risk for schizophrenia. Most studies did not find a sex difference for postconcussion symptoms in children and adults. No sex difference was found for risk of dementia and primary brain tumor, return to work, or posttraumatic stress syndrome., CONCLUSIONS: Sex is not a well-studied prognostic indicator for recovery after MTBI, but small sex differences were found for some outcomes. More well-designed studies are needed that report outcomes according to sex and control for potential confounders. Copyright Â© 2016 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Spatial Neglect Hinders Success of Inpatient Rehabilitation in Individuals With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Study.,"Chen, Peii; Ward, Irene; Khan, Ummais; Liu, Yan; Hreha, Kimberly","Background Current knowledge about spatial neglect and its impact on rehabilitation mostly originates from stroke studies. Objective To examine the impact of spatial neglect on rehabilitation outcome in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods The retrospective study included 156 consecutive patients with TBI (73 women; median age = 69.5 years; interquartile range = 50-81 years) at an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). We examined whether the presence of spatial neglect affected the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, length of stay, or discharge disposition. Based on the available medical records, we also explored whether spatial neglect was associated with tactile sensation or muscle strength asymmetry in the extremities and whether specific brain injuries or lesions predicted spatial neglect. Results In all, 30.1% (47 of 156) of the sample had spatial neglect. Sex, age, severity of TBI, or time postinjury did not differ between patients with and without spatial neglect. In comparison to patients without spatial neglect, patients with the disorder stayed in IRF 5 days longer, had lower FIM scores at discharge, improved slower in both Cognitive and Motor FIM scores, and might have less likelihood of return home. In addition, left-sided neglect was associated with asymmetric strength in the lower extremities, specifically left weaker than the right. Finally, brain injury-induced mass effect predicted left-sided neglect. Conclusions Spatial neglect is common following TBI, impedes rehabilitation progress in both motor and cognitive domains, and prolongs length of stay. Future research is needed for linking specific traumatic injuries and lesioned networks to spatial neglect and related impairment.

There were no significant differences in favorable outcome (relative risk (RR) 1.07, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.27, P = 0.41) and mortality rate (RR 0.85, 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.13, P = 0.27) between progesterone and placebo groups. In a subgroup analysis, favorable outcome (RR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.89, P = 0.007) and decreased mortality rate (RR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.41 to 0.84, P = 0.004) are only observed in the phase II RCTs. The included factors were the severity of TBI, method of drug administration, and duration of observation and had no influence on the observed outcomes. Sensitivity analysis showed that all the outcomes were stable after excluding Shakeri (Clin Neurol Neurosurg 115: 2019-2022, 2013) or Wright (N Engl J Med 371: 2457-2466, 2014) trials. The quality of the evidence was varied from high to low. In conclusion, progesterone has no significant improvement in the functional recovery and mortality rate after acute TBI.",2016,/,Molecular neurobiology,53,10,7070-7077,,,26676571,#6871,Wang 2016,,maybe
Longitudinal Diffusion Tensor Imaging Detects Recovery of Fractional Anisotropy Within Traumatic Axonal Injury Lesions.,"Edlow, Brian L; Copen, William A; Izzy, Saef; van der Kouwe, Andre; Glenn, Mel B; Greenberg, Steven M; Greer, David M; Wu, Ona","BACKGROUND: Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) may be reversible, yet there are currently no clinical imaging tools to detect axonal recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize serial changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) within TAI lesions of the corpus callosum (CC). We hypothesized that recovery of FA within a TAI lesion correlates with better functional outcome., METHODS: Patients who underwent both an acute DTI scan (<=day 7) and a subacute DTI scan (day 14 to inpatient rehabilitation discharge) at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. TAI lesions were manually traced on the acute diffusion-weighted images. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured within the TAI lesions at each time point. FA recovery was defined by a longitudinal increase in CC FA that exceeded the coefficient of variation for FA based on values from healthy controls. Acute FA, ADC, AD, and RD were compared in lesions with and without FA recovery, and correlations were tested between lesional FA recovery and functional recovery, as determined by disability rating scale score at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation., RESULTS: Eleven TAI lesions were identified in 7 patients. DTI detected FA recovery within 2 of 11 TAI lesions. Acute FA, ADC, AD, and RD did not differ between lesions with and without FA recovery. Lesional FA recovery did not correlate with disability rating scale scores., CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective longitudinal study, we provide initial evidence that FA can recover within TAI lesions. However, FA recovery did not correlate with improved functional outcomes. Prospective histopathological and clinical studies are needed to further elucidate whether lesional FA recovery indicates axonal healing and has prognostic significance.",2016,/,Neurocritical care,24,3,342-52,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-015-0216-8,26690938,#6867,Edlow 2016,,maybe
Predictors of Post-concussion Rehabilitation Outcomes at Three-month Follow-up.,"Scott, Katie L; Strong, Carrie-Ann H; Gorter, Bethany; Donders, Jacobus","OBJECTIVE: To determine factors related to three-month follow-up outcomes for individuals participating in an outpatient rehabilitative treatment program for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI)., METHOD: Fifty participants underwent neuropsychological screening prior to treatment initiation and completed the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4) at treatment initiation, discharge from treatment, and three months following discharge., RESULTS: Regression models indicated that information garnered from the neuropsychological screening prior to treatment initiation (e.g., mood symptoms and prior psychiatric history) accounted for unique variance in three-month post-discharge outcomes on several MPAI-4 subscales. Specifically, after controlling for baseline MPAI-4 ratings, higher Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II) scores were associated with worse MPAI-4 Ability scores at three-month follow-up, and the presence of a psychiatric history was associated with worse MPAI-4 Adjustment scores at three-month follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological screening prior to the initiation of treatment for mild TBI can help to identify patients who may be at greater risk for poorer rehabilitation outcomes, thus allowing for the implementation of specific interventions to address these risk factors.",2016,/,The Clinical neuropsychologist,30,1,66-81,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2015.1127427,26732525,#6850,Scott 2016,,maybe

However, the incidence and associated causes of ARDS in isolated TBI have not been well studied., METHODS: We performed a subgroup analysis of 210 consecutive patients with isolated severe TBI enrolled in a prospective observational cohort at a Level 1 trauma center between 2005 and 2014. Subjects required endotracheal intubation and had isolated severe TBI defined by a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or greater and AIS score lower than 3 in all other categories. ARDS within the first 8 days of admission was rigorously adjudicated using Berlin criteria. Regression analyses were used to test the association between predictors of interest and ARDS., RESULTS: The incidence of ARDS in the first 8 days after severe isolated TBI was 30%. Patients who developed ARDS were administered more crystalloids (4.3 L vs. 3.5 L, p = 0.005) and blood products in the first 12 hours of admission. Patients with ARDS had significantly worse clinical outcomes measured at 28 days, including longer median intensive care unit and hospital stays (4 days vs. 13 days, p < 0.001, and 7.5 days vs. 14.5 days, p < 0.001, respectively). In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, the odds of developing ARDS were significantly associated with head AIS score (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; p = 0.018), male sex (OR, 2.9; p = 0.012), and early transfusion of platelets (OR, 2.8; p = 0.003). These associations were similar in a multivariate logistic regression model., CONCLUSION: In the era of balanced hemostatic resuscitation practices, severity of head injury, male sex, early crystalloids, and early transfusion of platelets are associated with a higher risk of ARDS after severe isolated TBI.

Sleep Features on Continuous Electroencephalography Predict Rehabilitation Outcomes After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Sandsmark, Danielle K; Kumar, Monisha A; Woodward, Catherine S; Schmitt, Sarah E; Park, Soojin; Lim, Miranda M","OBJECTIVE: Sleep characteristics detected by electroencephalography (EEG) may be predictive of neurological recovery and rehabilitation outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We sought to determine whether sleep features were associated with greater access to rehabilitation therapies and better functional outcomes after severe TBI., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients admitted with severe TBI who underwent 24 or more hours of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring within 14 days of injury for sleep elements and ictal activity. Patient outcomes included discharge disposition and modified Rankin Scale (mRS)., RESULTS: A total of 64 patients underwent cEEG monitoring for a mean of 50.6 hours. Status epilepticus or electrographic seizures detected by cEEG were associated with poor outcomes (death or discharge to skilled nursing facility). Sleep characteristics were present in 19 (30%) and associated with better outcome (89% discharged to home/acute rehabilitation; P = .0002). Lack of sleep elements on cEEG correlated with a poor outcome or mRS > 4 at hospital discharge (P = .012). Of those patients who were transferred to skilled nursing/acute rehabilitation, sleep architecture on cEEG associated with a shorter inpatient hospital stay (20 days vs 27 days) and earlier participation in therapy (9.8 days vs 13.2 days postinjury). Multivariable analyses indicated that sleep features on cEEG predicted functional outcomes independent of admission Glasgow Coma Scale and ictal-interictal activity., CONCLUSION: The presence of sleep features in the acute period after TBI indicates earlier participation in rehabilitative therapies and a better functional recovery. By contrast, status epilepticus, other ictal activity, or absent sleep architecture may portend a worse prognosis.

Adult sports-related traumatic brain injury in United States trauma centers.,"Winkler, Ethan A; Yue, John K; Burke, John F; Chan, Andrew K; Dhall, Sanjay S; Berger, Mitchel S; Manley, Geoffrey T; Tarapore, Phiroz E","OBJECTIVE Sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public health concern estimated to affect 300,000 to 3.8 million people annually in the United States. Although injuries to professional athletes dominate the media, this group represents only a small proportion of the overall population. Here, the authors characterize the demographics of sports-related TBI in adults from a community-based trauma population and identify predictors of prolonged hospitalization and increased morbidity and mortality rates. METHODS Utilizing the National Sample Program of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), the authors retrospectively analyzed sports-related TBI data from adults (age >= 18 years) across 5 sporting categories-fall or interpersonal contact (FIC), roller sports, skiing/snowboarding, equestrian sports, and aquatic sports. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify predictors of prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS), medical complications, inpatient mortality rates, and hospital discharge disposition. Statistical significance was assessed at alpha < 0.05, and the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied for each outcome analysis. RESULTS From 2003 to 2012, in total, 4788 adult sports-related TBIs were documented in the NTDB, which represented 18,310 incidents nationally. Equestrian sports were the greatest contributors to sports-related TBI (45.2%). Mild TBI represented nearly 86% of injuries overall. Mean (+/- SEM) LOSs in the hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) were 4.25 +/- 0.09 days and 1.60 +/- 0.06 days, respectively. The mortality rate was 3.0% across all patients, but was statistically higher in TBI from roller sports (4.1%) and aquatic sports (7.7%). Age, hypotension on admission to the emergency department (ED), and the severity of head and extracranial injuries were statistically significant predictors of prolonged hospital and ICU LOSs, medical complications, failure to discharge to home, and death. Traumatic brain injury during aquatic sports was similarly associated with prolonged ICU and hospital LOSs, medical complications, and failure to be discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS Age, hypotension on ED admission, severity of head and extracranial injuries, and sports mechanism of injury are important prognostic variables in adult sports-related TBI.

The differential mortality of Glasgow Coma Score in patients with and without head injury.,"Osler, Turner; Cook, Alan; Glance, Laurent G; Lecky, Fiona; Bouamra, Omar; Garrett, Mark; Buzas, Jeffery S; Hosmer, David W","IMPORTANCE: The GCS was created forty years ago as a measure of impaired consciousness following head injury and thus the association of GCS with mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is expected. The association of GCS with mortality in patients without TBI (non-TBI) has been assumed to be similar. However, if this assumption is incorrect mortality prediction models incorporating GCS as a predictor will need to be revised., OBJECTIVE: To determine if the association of GCS with mortality is influenced by the presence of TBI., DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using the National Trauma Data Bank (2012; N=639,549) we categorized patients as isolated TBI (12.8%), isolated non-TBI (33%), both (4.8%), or neither (49.4%) based on the presence of AIS codes of severity 3 or greater. We compared the ability GCS to discriminate survivors from non-survivors in TBI and in non-TBI patients using logistic models. We also estimated the odds ratios of death for TBI and non-TBI patients at each value of GCS using linear combinations of coefficients., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death during hospital admission., RESULTS: As the sole predictor in a logistic model GCS discriminated survivors from non-survivors at an acceptable level (c-statistic=0.76), but discriminated better in the case of TBI patients (c-statistic=0.81) than non-TBI patients (c-statistic=0.70). In both unadjusted and covariate adjusted models TBI patients were about twice as likely to die as non-TBI patients with the same GCS for GCS values<8; for GCS values>8 TBI and non-TBI patients were at similar risk of dying., CONCLUSIONS: A depressed GCS predicts death better in TBI patients than non-TBI patients, likely because in non-TBI patients a depressed GCS may simply be the result of entirely reversible intoxication by alcohol or drugs; in TBI patients, by contrast, a depressed GCS is more ominous because it is likely due to a head injury with its attendant threat to survival.

Secondary measures included frequency and timing of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, related complications, emergence from and duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), Rancho Los Amigos Scale (RLAS) score, and FIM score at rehabilitation admission and discharge., RESULTS: Of 701 patients with TBI admitted, 59 (8%) were diagnosed with PTH. Of these, the median age was 25 years, with 73% being men. At initial presentation, 52 (88%) did not follow commands. Fifty-two (90%) patients with PTH had a VP shunt placed. Median time from injury to shunt placement was 69 (range, 9-366) days. Seven (12%) patients with PTH experienced postsurgical seizure, 3 (6%) had shunt infection, and 7 (12%) had shunt malfunction. Thirty-six (61%) patients with PTH emerged from PTA during rehabilitation. Median total FIM score at rehabilitation admission was 20 (range, 18-76), and at discharge it was 43 (range, 18-118). Injury severity predicted outcome at rehabilitation admission, whereas shunt timing predicted outcome at rehabilitation discharge., CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of PTH was observed in 8% of patients with TBI in inpatient rehabilitation. Earlier shunting predicted improved outcome during rehabilitation.

Early fever after trauma: Does it matter?.,"Hinson, Holly E; Rowell, Susan; Morris, Cynthia; Lin, Amber L; Schreiber, Martin A","BACKGROUND: Fever is strongly associated with poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that early fever is a direct result of brain injury and thus would be more common in TBI than in patients without brain injury and associated with inflammation., METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with major trauma with and without TBI from a busy Level I trauma center intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were assigned to one of four groups based on their presenting Head Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale scores: multiple injuries: head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score greater than 2, one other region greater than 2; isolated head: head AIS score greater than 2, all other regions less than 3; isolated body: one region greater than 2, excluding head/face; minor injury: no region with AIS greater than 2. Early fever was defined as at least one recorded temperature greater than 38.3degreeC in the first 48 hours after admission. Outcome measures included neurologic deterioration, length of stay in the ICU, hospital mortality, discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, and plasma levels of seven key cytokines at admission and 24 hours (exploratory)., RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-eight patients were enrolled, including subjects with multiple injuries (n = 59), isolated head (n = 97), isolated body (n = 100), and minor trauma (n = 12). The incidence of fever was similar in all groups irrespective of injury (11-24%).

Association between augmented renal clearance and clinical failure of antibiotic treatment in brain-injured patients with ventilator-acquired pneumonia: A preliminary study.,"Carrie, Cedric; Bentejac, Merry; Cottenceau, Vincent; Masson, Francoise; Petit, Laurent; Cochard, Jean-Francois; Sztark, Francois","OBJECTIVES: This preliminary study aimed to determine whether augmented renal clearance (ARC) impacts negatively on the clinical outcome in traumatic brain-injured patients (TBI) treated for a first episode of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)., METHODS: During a 5-year period, all TBI patients who had developed VAP were retrospectively reviewed to assess variables associated with clinical failure in multivariate analysis. Clinical failure was defined as an impaired clinical response with a need for escalating antibiotics during treatment and/or within 15 days after the end-of-treatment. Recurrence was considered if at least one of the initial causative bacterial strains was growing at a significant concentration from a second sample. Augmented renal clearance (ARC) was defined by an enhanced creatinine clearance exceeding 130mL/min/1.73m2 calculated from a urinary sample during the first three days of antimicrobial therapy., MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 223 TBI patients with VAP were included and 59 (26%) presented a clinical failure. Factors statistically associated with clinical failure were GSC<=7 (OR=2.2 [1.1-4.4], P=0.03), early VAP (OR=3.9 [1.9-7.8], P=0.0001), bacteraemia (OR=11 [2.2-54], P=0.003) and antimicrobial therapy<=7 days (OR=3.7 [1.8-7.4], P=0.0003). ARC was statistically associated with recurrent infections with an OR of 4.4 [1.2-16], P=0.03., CONCLUSION: ARC was associated with recurrent infection after a first episode of VAP in TBI patients.

Clinical characteristics and temporal profile of recovery in patients with favorable outcomes at 6 months after severe traumatic brain injury.,"Vedantam, Aditya; Robertson, Claudia S; Gopinath, Shankar P","OBJECTIVE Early withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment due to expected poor prognosis is responsible for the majority of in-house deaths in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). With increased focus on the decision and timing of withdrawal of care in patients with severe TBI, data on early neurological recovery in patients with a favorable outcome is needed to guide physicians and families. METHODS The authors reviewed prospectively collected data obtained in 1241 patients with head injury who were treated between 1986 and 2012. Patients with severe TBI, motor Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS) score < 6 on admission, and those who had favorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score of 4 or 5, indicating moderate disability or good recovery) at 6 months were selected. Baseline demographic, clinical, and imaging data were analyzed. The time from injury to the first record of following commands (mGCS score of 6) after injury was recorded. The temporal profile of GOS scores from discharge to 6 months after the injury was also assessed. RESULTS The authors studied 218 patients (183 male and 35 female) with a mean age of 28.9 +/- 11.2 years. The majority of patients were able to follow commands (mGCS score of 6) within the 1st week after injury (71.4%), with the highest percentage of patients in this group recovering on Day 1 (28.6%). Recovery to the point of following commands beyond 2 weeks after the injury was seen in 14.8% of patients, who experienced significantly longer durations of intracranial pressure monitoring (p = 0.001) and neuromuscular blockade (p < 0.001). In comparison with patients with moderate disability, patients with good recovery had a higher initial GCS score (p = 0.01), lower incidence of anisocoria at admission (p = 0.048), and a shorter ICU stay (p < 0.001) and total hospital stay (p < 0.001). There was considerable improvement in GOS scores from discharge to follow-up at 6 months.

Heart rate variability and implication for sport concussion.,"Bishop, Scott A; Dech, Ryan T; Guzik, Przemyslaw; Neary, J Patrick","Finding sensitive and specific markers for sports-related concussion is both challenging and clinically important. Such biomarkers might be helpful in the management of patients with concussion (i.e. diagnosis, monitoring and risk prediction). Among many parameters, blood flow-pressure metrics and heart rate variability (HRV) have been used to gauge concussion outcomes. Reports on the relation between HRV and both acute and prolonged concussion recovery are conflicting. While some authors report on differences in the low-frequency (LF) component of HRV during postural manipulations and postexercise conditions, others observe no significant differences in various HRV measures. Despite the early success of using the HRV LF for concussion recovery, the interpretation of the LF is debated. Recent research suggests the LF power is a net effect of several intrinsic modulatory factors from both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, vagally mediated baroreflex and even some respiratory influences at lower respiratory rate. There are only a few well-controlled concussion studies that specifically examine the contribution of the autonomic nervous system branches with HRV for concussion management. This study reviews the most recent HRV- concussion literature and the underlying HRV physiology. It also highlights cerebral blood flow studies related to concussion and the importance of multimodal assessment of various biological signals. It is hoped that a better understanding of the physiology behind HRV might generate cost-effective, repeatable and reliable protocols, all of which will improve the interpretation of HRV throughout concussion recovery.

Effects of platelet dysfunction and platelet transfusion on outcomes in traumatic brain injury patients.,"Guillotte, Andrew R; Herbert, Joseph P; Madsen, Richard; Hammer, Richard D; Litofsky, N Scott","OBJECTIVE: Platelet inhibition in traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be due to injury or antiplatelet medication use pre-injury. This study aims to identify factors associated with increased platelet arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibition and determine if platelet transfusion reduces platelet dysfunction and affects outcome., METHODS: Prospective thromboelastography (TEG) assays were collected on adult patients with TBI with intracranial injuries detected by computed tomography (CT). Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, and CT lesion expansion., RESULTS: Of 153 patients, ADP inhibition was increased in moderate and severe TBI compared to mild TBI (p = 0.0011).

Cushing response-based warning system for intensive care of brain-injured patients.,"Tsai, Yi-Hsin; Lin, Jie-Ying; Huang, Yi-You; Wong, Jau-Min","OBJECTIVE: Cushing response (CR) is categorized. Wavelet transform (WT) and decision tree (DT) are utilized to analyze physiological signals from neurocritical patients. A warning model is built for recognition of CR, real-time evaluation of intracranial condition and prediction of neurological outcome., METHODS: Physiological signals of neurocritical patients are preprocessed by WT and compressed by linear regression. An algorithm labels each segment as pathological, physiological, negative or uncertain CR. The DT identifies CR. Continuous data input to the established DT predicts condition at that moment and following outcome., RESULTS: From 33 neurocritical patients, 422,524 sets of physiological signals were collected. The cross-validation scores of DT ranged from 0.562 to 0.579 with averaged accuracy rate 60.6% (3.5-98.1%). The model correctly predicted the outcome of the training group, 87.9% in accuracy. The ratios of pathological CR were 9.3+/-16.6%, 74.2+/-29.7% and 99.7+/-0.3% in patients of good, coma and death groups, respectively. The prediction accuracy for a test set of 103 patients reached 81.6%., CONCLUSIONS: Cushing response categorization helps in identifying critical conditions and predicting outcome., SIGNIFICANCE: A novel concept of four categories of Cushing response is proposed to represent broader ranges of intracranial change.

In the acute phase of severe TBI, HR is influenced by several factors (e.g., pain, sympathetic activation, hypovolemia, fever, body temperature). Therefore, admission HR and gross HR change should be examined in patients with TBI treated with a well-designed protocol, such as was done in the Brain Hypothermia (B-HYPO) Study., METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of the B-HYPO Study, which was conducted as a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in patients with severe TBI receiving mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH; 32.0 degreeC-34.0 degreeC) or fever control (35.5 degreeC-37.0 degreeC) in Japan. Patients with MTH were examined, and HR change (%HR) in the early MTH phase was calculated as follows: [admission HR - HR at day 1]/admission HR x 100. Patients were divided into six groups, using admission HR (< 80, 80-99, <= 100) and median of %HR; i.e., group (Admission HR < 80 and %HR >= 18.6); group (Admission HR < 80 and %HR < 18.6); group (Admission HR 80-99 and %HR >= 18.6); group (Admission HR 80-99 and %HR < 18.6); group (Admission HR >=100 and %HR >= 18.6); and group (Admission HR >=100 and %HR < 18.6). The primary outcome was an adjusted predicted probability of unfavorable neurological outcome at 6 months after TBI according to Glasgow Outcome Scale score, which is a measure of functional recovery and defined as severe disability, persistent vegetative state, and death., RESULTS: Overall, 79 patients with MTH (52.7% of the original trial) were examined; among these, unfavorable neurological outcomes were observed in 53.2%. Among all the groups, group (Admission HR >=100 and %HR < 18.6) exhibited the highest proportion of unfavorable outcomes, and 82.3% of patients had an adjusted predicted probability of unfavorable outcomes, whereas those in group (Admission HR < 80 and %HR >= 18.6) developed only 22.8% (p = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Mild HR decrease during the early phase of targeted temperature management following tachycardia at admission can be associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes after severe TBI.",2018,/,"Critical care (London, England)",22,1,352,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-018-2276-6,30567590,#5478,Inoue 2018,,maybe

The clinical records of patients who had experienced ladder-related falls who were admitted to the Advanced Emergency Medical Service Center at Kurume University Hospital between April 2013 and August 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 86 patients were enrolled. The mean patient age was 69.2 years, and 82 patients were male. The median fall height was 2.55 m. Sixty patients fell during non-professional use of the ladder. Forty-four patients experienced some type of head injury. Although the older patients had more frequent complications with head injuries, the height of the fall was not related statistically. The group of patients with head injuries exhibited trends of older age, lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, higher Injury Severity Score, and poorer outcomes than those of the group of patients without head injuries. Multivariate analysis showed that head injury and non-professional use were independent risk factors for poor outcomes. Our results revealed that ladder-related falls with head injury can occur when older people are working at home, even if they have fallen from a low height.

Using a retrospective cohort of nondecompressive craniectomy (non-DC) patients with TBI, we performed univariate and multi-variate binary logistic regression outcome analysis of: pressure reactivity index (PRx), pulse amplitude index (PAx), and a newly described index (RAC) calculated as the regression coefficient between ICP waveform amplitude and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Finally, we performed sequential chi-square threshold analysis for each index as it related to six-month binary outcomes. Outcome was assessed via dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scores (GOS): (A) favorable (GOS 4 or 5) versus unfavorable (GOS 3 or less), (B) alive versus dead. There were 358 non-DC patients with TBI included in all aspects of the analysis. In an analysis of the entire recording period for all patients using univariate binary logistic regression, the areas under the curves (AUCs) for favorable versus unfavorable outcome were: PRx (0.573, p < 0.0001), PAx (0.606, p < 0.0001), and RAC (0.655, p < 0.0001). Similarly, the AUCs for alive versus dead outcome were: PRx (0.651, p < 0.0001), PAx (0.705, p < 0.0001), and RAC (0.722, p < 0.0001). RAC displayed superior AUC statistics compared with PRx and PAx, using both univariate and multi-variate regression. RAC displayed more stable critical thresholds related to six-month outcomes. Thresholds for both favorable versus unfavorable and alive versus dead outcomes for PRx, PAx, and RAC across the entire recording period were: +0.35 and +0.35, 0 and +0.25, -0.10 and -0.05, respectively. In non-DC patients with TBI, RAC appears to be superior to PRx and PAx in six-month outcome prediction, using both univariate and multi-variate logistic regression.

The intracranial number of foreign bodies as a predictor of mortality after penetrating brain injury.,"Bolatkale, Mustafa; Acara, Ahmet Cagdas","INTRODUCTION: Penetrating brain injury (PBI) is the most lethal form of traumatic brain injury, which is a leading cause of mortality. PBI has a mortality rate of 23%-93% and 87%-100% with poor neurological status. Despite the use of various prognostic factors there is still a need for a specific prognostic factor for early prediction of mortality in PBI to reduce mortality and provide good outcomes with cost-effective surgical treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of the number of intracranial foreign bodies (FBs) on mortality in PBI in the Emergency Department., METHODS: The study included 95 patients admitted with PBI caused by barrel bomb explosion. The intracranial number of FB was examined by brain computed tomography. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of the intracranial number of FB on mortality. Correlation analyses were performed to investigate the association of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) with intracranial number of FB., RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value of the intracranial number of FB calculated for mortality was 2, which was effective for predicting mortality (p<.001). In patients with >2 intracranial FB, the mortality rate was statistically significantly 51-fold higher than those with <=2 (p<.001). A statistically significant negative correlation was determined between GCS and number FB (r=-0.697; p<.001)., CONCLUSION: When the intracranial number of FB was >2, mortality significantly increased in patients with PBI. The intracranial number of FBs may be considered as a novel prognostic factor for the prediction of mortality in PBI. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Disorders of Consciousness due to Traumatic Brain Injury: Functional Status Ten Years Post-Injury.,"Hammond, Flora M; Giacino, Joseph T; Nakase Richardson, Risa; Sherer, Mark; Zafonte, Ross D; Whyte, John; Arciniegas, David B; Tang, Xinyu","Few studies have assessed the long-term functional outcomes of patients with a disorder of consciousness due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study examined functional status during the first 10 years after TBI among a cohort with disorders of consciousness (i.e., coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state). The study sample included 110 individuals with TBI who were unable to follow commands prior to inpatient rehabilitation and for whom follow-up data were available at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years post-injury. The sample was subdivided into those who demonstrated command-following early (before 28 days post-injury) versus late (>= 28 days post-injury or never). Functional Independence Measure (FIM) at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years following TBI was used to measure functional outcomes. Measureable functional recovery occurred throughout the 10-year period, with more than two thirds of the sample achieving independence in mobility and self-care, and about one quarter achieving independent cognitive function by 10 years. Following commands prior to 28 days was associated with greater functional independence at all outcome time-points. Multi-trajectory modeling of recovery of three FIM subscales (self-care, mobility, cognition) revealed four distinct prognostic groups with different temporal patterns of change on these subscales. More than half the sample achieved near-maximal recovery by 1 year post-injury, while the later command-following subgroups recovered over longer periods of time. Significant late functional decline was not observed in this cohort. Among a cohort of patients unable to follow commands at the time of inpatient rehabilitation, a substantial proportion achieved functional independence in self-care, mobility, and cognition. The proportion of participants achieving functional independence increased between 5 and 10 years post-injury. These findings suggest that individuals with disorders of consciousness may benefit from ongoing functional monitoring and updated care plans for at least the first decade after TBI.",2019,/,Journal of neurotrauma,36,7,1136-1146,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5954,30226400,#5418,Hammond 2019,,maybe
"Elevated serum miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 are noninvasive biomarkers for the presence and progression of traumatic brain injury.","Yang, Ting; Song, Jiaxi; Bu, Xiaomin; Wang, Cheng; Wu, Jia; Cai, Jialu; Wan, Shujun; Fan, Chunli; Zhang, Chunni; Wang, Junjun","The levels of miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 have been reported to be up-regulated in the tissues of experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) rat models. However, the clinical diagnostic and prognostic values of the serum signatures of these 3 miRNAs in TBI remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression levels of these 3 microRNAs (miRNAs) in the sera of TBI patients and to evaluate their relationships with the severity and clinical outcome of TBI. The serum levels of these miRNAs were assessed in TBI patients (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 38) by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. The severities and clinical outcomes of the TBI patients were evaluated with the Glasgow coma scale and the Glasgow outcome scale. The serum miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 levels were significantly increased in the TBI patients compared with the controls at all examined time points, and these levels were significantly higher in the patients with severe TBI than in those with moderate or mild TBI (p < 0.05). The serum miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 levels were significantly higher in the patients with a poor outcome than in those with a good outcome (p < 0.05). The AUCs of miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 for distinguishing the TBI patients from the healthy controls were 1.000 (p < 0.001), 0.727 (p < 0.001) and 0.801 (p < 0.001), respectively. Interestingly, the AUCs of miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 for distinguishing the mild TBI patients from the healthy controls were 1.000 (p < 0.001), 0.742 (p < 0.001) and 0.819 (p < 0.001), respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 are potentially valuable indicators of the diagnosis, severity, and prognosis of TBI. Our study showed that the serum levels of miR-93, miR-191, and miR-499 are all increased in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Their serum levels are associated with TBI severity and outcome, which suggest that these miRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of TBI.

Three advanced practice nurses administered the FOUR score, GCS, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) concurrently from ICU admissions. The endpoint of observation was mortality when the patients left the ICU. Data are presented as frequency with percentages, mean with standard deviation, or median with interquartile range. Each measurement tool used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the predictive power between these four tools. In addition, the difference between survival and death was estimated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test., RESULTS: From 55 TBI patients, males (72.73 %) were represented more than females, the mean age was 63.1 +/- 17.9, and 19 of 55 observations (35 %) had a maximum FOUR score of 16.

MRI detection of cerebral lesions in post-traumatic anisocoria: specificity and prognostic significance.,"Woischneck, D; Schmitz, B; Kapapa, T","AIM: To identify whether increased numbers of brainstem lesions are found in the presence of a post-traumatic pupillary function disturbance and classify them anatomically., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed within 8 days after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients who had been unconscious for more than 24 hours post-TBI. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was evaluated 6 months after TBI. The data obtained from 140 consecutively enrolled patients between 2005 and 2011 were analysed. The clinical study parameter comprised the development of post-traumatic anisocoria at least once over the course between onset of trauma and diagnostic MRI, as a yes/no decision. Significance was presumed at p<=0.05., RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (41%) were found to have a lesion at MRI without involvement of the brainstem; in 83 (59%) the brainstem was (multiple) affected. Of the latter, 66 (46%) of patients had lesions in the midbrain, 38 (27%) in the pons, and seven (5%) in the medulla oblongata. By the time of MRI, anisocoria had been diagnosed in 45 (32%) patients. Mortality was highest, at 58%, in patients with anisocoria and a midbrain lesion, whilst it was 23% in those with anisocoria and no lesion in the midbrain. Mortality was 33% in relation to a midbrain lesion without anisocoria., CONCLUSION: Overall, the study demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between midbrain lesions and post-traumatic anisocoria in unconscious trauma patients. A brainstem lesion in this case can be assumed to be a pathomorphological correlate of anisocoria. The rate of damage to the midbrain was approximately 50% in cases of transient anisocoria. It can be assumed in this situation that there are functional disorders of the peripheral oculomotor nerve or identifiable/unidentifiable lesions of the brainstem.

Functioning and health-related quality of life following injury in older people: a systematic review.,"Brown, Katherine; Cameron, Ian D; Keay, Lisa; Coxon, Kristy; Ivers, Rebecca","AIM AND BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence around the impact of injury and recovery trajectories but little focuses on older people, despite rising burden. The aim of this review was to describe the evidence for postinjury functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older people., METHOD: A systematic search of three databases and an extensive search of the grey literature was carried out on prospective injury outcome studies in older people (age >=65 years) that used a generic health status outcome measure. The search results were reported using PRISMA reporting guidelines, and risk of bias was assessed using a modification of the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool., RESULTS: There was limited evidence on functioning and HRQoL postinjury in older people. There were 367 studies identified, with 13 eligible for inclusion. Most focused on hip fracture or traumatic brain injury. Older people appeared to have poorer postinjury functioning and HRQoL compared with younger adults or preinjury levels. Poor preinjury function, pre-existing conditions and increasing age were associated with poorer outcomes, whereas preinjury-independent living was associated with better outcomes., DISCUSSION: The studies were heterogeneous, limiting synthesis. There was a lack of evidence around the impact of injury on older people in terms of paid work and unpaid work. It was unclear if existing injury outcome guidelines are appropriate for older people., CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required on older people's postinjury course, outcomes and determinants. This will require standardised methodologies and qualitative studies. The findings will inform clinical care, policy development, health and compensation systems.

Predictive validity of disability rating scale in determining functional outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Deepika, Akhil; Devi, B Indira; Shukla, Dhaval","BACKGROUND: Most patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are discharged when they have still not recovered completely. Many such patients are not available for follow up., AIMS: We conducted this study to determine whether the condition at discharge from acute care setting, as assessed with disability rating scale (DRS), correlates with functional outcome at follow up., SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was conducted at a Neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care referral center. This was a prospective observational study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients admitted to ICU with a diagnosis of severe TBI were enrolled for the study. On the day of discharge, all patients underwent DRS assessment. A final assessment was performed using Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE) at 6 months after discharge from the hospital., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The correlation between the DRS scores at the time of discharge with DRS scores and GOSE categories at 6 months after discharge was determined using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient., RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were recruited for the study. The correlation coefficient of DRS at discharge for DRS at 6 months was 0.536 and for GOSE was -0.553. The area under the curve of DRS score at discharge for predicting unfavorable outcome and mortality at 6 months was 0.770 and 0.820, respectively., CONCLUSION: The predictive validity of DRS is fair to good in determining GOSE at follow-up. Pending availability of a more accurate outcome assessment tool, DRS at discharge can be used as a surrogate outcome for GOSE at follow up.",2017,/,Neurology India,65,1,83-86,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.198228,28084245,#6297,Deepika 2017,,yes
A population-based study on epidemiology of intensive care unit treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland.,"Jonsdottir, G M; Lund, S H; Snorradottir, B; Karason, S; Olafsson, I H; Reynisson, K; Mogensen, B; Sigvaldason, K","BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period., METHODS: Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999-2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification., RESULTS: Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

Increased prognostic accuracy of TBI when a brain electrical activity biomarker is added to loss of consciousness (LOC).,"Hack, Dallas; Huff, J Stephen; Curley, Kenneth; Naunheim, Roseanne; Ghosh Dastidar, Samanwoy; Prichep, Leslie S","BACKGROUND: Extremely high accuracy for predicting CT+ traumatic brain injury (TBI) using a quantitative EEG (QEEG) based multivariate classification algorithm was demonstrated in an independent validation trial, in Emergency Department (ED) patients, using an easy to use handheld device. This study compares the predictive power using that algorithm (which includes LOC and amnesia), to the predictive power of LOC alone or LOC plus traumatic amnesia., PARTICIPANTS: ED patients 18-85years presenting within 72h of closed head injury, with GSC 12-15, were study candidates. 680 patients with known absence or presence of LOC were enrolled (145 CT+ and 535 CT- patients)., METHODS: 5-10min of eyes closed EEG was acquired using the Ahead 300 handheld device, from frontal and frontotemporal regions. The same classification algorithm methodology was used for both the EEG based and the LOC based algorithms. Predictive power was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC) and odds ratios., RESULTS: The QEEG based classification algorithm demonstrated significant improvement in predictive power compared with LOC alone, both in improved AUC (83% improvement) and odds ratio (increase from 4.65 to 16.22). Adding RGA and/or PTA to LOC was not improved over LOC alone., CONCLUSIONS: Rapid triage of TBI relies on strong initial predictors. Addition of an electrophysiological based marker was shown to outperform report of LOC alone or LOC plus amnesia, in determining risk of an intracranial bleed. In addition, ease of use at point-of-care, non-invasive, and rapid result using such technology suggests significant value added to standard clinical prediction. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

MicroRNAs as Novel Biomarkers for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Mild and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Di Pietro, Valentina; Ragusa, Marco; Davies, David; Su, Zhangjie; Hazeldine, Jon; Lazzarino, Giacomo; Hill, Lisa J; Crombie, Nicholas; Foster, Mark; Purrello, Michele; Logan, Ann; Belli, Antonio","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people younger than 45 in Western countries. Despite many studies, no reliable biomarkers have been found to assess TBI severity and predict recovery. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling has become widely used to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Through use of the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A+B Cards, the expression of 754 miRNAs was analyzed in serum of five mild TBI (mTBI) patients with extra-cranial injury (EC), five severe TBI (sTBI) patients with EC, and five healthy volunteers (HV) at 1 day and 15 days post-injury. The aim was to find candidate biomarkers able to discriminate between mTBI and sTBI. Following this, it was possible to select 10 miRNAs for further study in an enlarged validation cohort of 120 patients by using single TaqMan assays at the following time-points: T0-1 h, T4-12 h, T48-72 h, and 15 days from the injury. Analysis revealed two miRNAs (miR-425-5p and miR-502) that were significantly downregulated (p < 0.05) in mTBI at early time-points and are ideal candidates for diagnosis of mTBI, and two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-335) that were significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) and are valid biomarkers for the diagnosis of sTBI. In addition, miR-425-5p was a strong predictor of 6-month outcome at T0-1 h and T4-12 h, while miR-21 was predictive of the outcome at T4-12 h. The panel of selected miRNAs shows promise as biomarkers to discriminate mTBI from sTBI. In addition, the selected miRNAs represent new potential therapeutic targets.",2017,/,Journal of neurotrauma,34,11,1948-1956,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2016.4857,28279125,#6235,DiPietro 2017,,yes
Computed tomography and clinical outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Stenberg, Maud; Koskinen, Lars-Owe D; Jonasson, Per; Levi, Richard; Stalnacke, Britt-Marie","OBJECTIVE: To study: (i) acute computed tomography (CT) characteristics and clinical outcome; (ii) clinical course and (iii) Corticosteroid Randomisation after Significant Head Injury acute calculator protocol (CRASH) model and clinical outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI)., METHODS: Initial CT (CTi) and CT 24 hours post-trauma (CT24) were evaluated according to Marshall and Rotterdam classifications. Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale-Revised (RLAS-R) and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) were assessed at three months and one year post-trauma. The prognostic value of the CRASH model was evaluated., RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. Marshall CTi and CT24 were significantly correlated with RLAS-R at three months. Rotterdam CT24 was significantly correlated with GOSE at three months. RLAS-R and the GOSE improved significantly from three months to one year. CRASH predicted unfavourable outcome at six months for 81% of patients with bad outcome and for 85% of patients with favourable outcome according to GOSE at one year., CONCLUSION: Neither CT nor CRASH yielded clinically useful predictions of outcome at one year post-injury. The study showed encouragingly many instances of significant recovery in this population of sTBI. The combination of lack of reliable prognostic indicators and favourable outcomes supports the case for intensive acute management and rehabilitation as the default protocol in the cases of sTBI.",2017,/,Brain injury,31,3,351-358,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2016.1261303,28296529,#6231,Stenberg 2017,,yes
Serum thioredoxin and in-hospital major adverse events after traumatic brain injury.,"Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Yu, Wen-Hua; Zhang, Zu-Yong; Yang, Ding-Bo; Du, Quan; Wang, Hao; Shen, Yong-Feng; Jiang, Li; Che, Zhi-Hao; Zhu, Qiang","BACKGROUND: In-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs), mainly including acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction, are associated with poor prognosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thioredoxin, a potent anti-oxidant, has been identified as an oxidative stress marker. This study was designed to explore the association of serum thioredoxin concentrations with IMAEs of patients with severe TBI., METHODS: This prospective, observational study recruited a total of 108 healthy controls and 108 patients with severe TBI. We investigated the possible relation of serum thioredoxin concentrations to IMAEs and trauma severity (reflected by Glasgow coma scale scores) following TBI using a multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Serum thioredoxin concentrations were higher in the patients than in the controls. Serum concentrations of thioredoxin significantly correlated with admission Glasgow coma scale scores. Thioredoxin in serum independently predicted any IMAEs. As compared to admission Glasgow coma scale scores, thioredoxin concentrations had similar areas under receiver operating characteristic curve for any IMAEs., CONCLUSION: Increased serum thioredoxin concentrations are highly associated with trauma severity and IMAEs, indicating thioredoxin might be a potential prognostic biomarker after TBI.

Prognostic model for patients with traumatic brain injuries and abnormal computed tomography scans.,"Junior, Jefferson Rosi; Welling, Leonardo C; Schafranski, Marcelo; Yeng, Lin Tchia; do Prado, Rogerio Ruscito; Koterba, Edwin; de Andrade, Almir Ferreira; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen; Figueiredo, Eberval Gadelha","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. The prognosis evaluation is a challenge when many variables are involved. The authors aimed to develop prognostic model for assessment of survival chances after TBI based on admission characteristics, including extracranial injuries, which would allow application of the model before in-hospital therapeutic interventions. A cohort study evaluated 1275 patients with TBI and abnormal CT scans upon admission to the emergency unit of Hospital das Clinicas of University of Sao Paulo and analyzed the final outcome on mortality. A logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine the adjusted weigh of each independent variable in the outcome. Four variables were found to be significant in the model: age (years), Glasgow Coma Scale (3-15), Marshall Scale (MS, stratified into 2,3 or 4,5,6; according to the best group positive predictive value) and anysochoria (yes/no). The following formula is in a logistic model (USP index to head injury) estimates the probability of death of patients according to characteristics that influence on mortality. We consider that our mathematical probability model (USP Index) may be applied to clinical prognosis in patients with abnormal CT scans after severe traumatic brain injury.

Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations correlate with prognosis of traumatic brain injury.,"Yang, Ding-Bo; Yu, Wen-Hua; Dong, Xiao-Qiao; Zhang, Zu-Yong; Du, Quan; Zhu, Qiang; Che, Zhi-Hao; Wang, Hao; Shen, Yong-Feng; Jiang, Li","BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine. Serum MIF concentrations are associated with the severity and prognosis of ischemic stroke., METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and MIF among 108 severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and 108 controls were measured. We determined whether serum MIF concentrations are associated with inflammation, severity, in-hospital major adverse events (IMAEs) (i.e., in-hospital mortality, acute lung injury, acute traumatic coagulopathy, progressive hemorrhagic injury and posttraumatic cerebral infarction) and long-term clinical outcome (i.e., 6-month functional outcome) after TBI., RESULTS: As compared to the controls, serum CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MIF concentrations were significantly increased. MIF concentrations correlated with WBC count, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores. MIF in serum was independently associated with IMAEs and long-term clinical outcome. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve of MIF concentrations was similar to GCS scores'. Moreover, MIF concentrations markedly improved the predictive value of GCS scores for 6-month unfavorable outcome., CONCLUSION: Increased serum MIF concentrations have close relation to inflammation, trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing MIF as a good prognostic biomarker after TBI.

A prospective outcome study observing patients with severe traumatic brain injury over 10-15 years.,"Andersson, E; Rackauskaite, D; Svanborg, E; Csajbok, L; Ost, M; Nellgard, B","BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) can be divided into primary and secondary injuries. Intensive care protocols focus on preventing secondary injuries. This prospective cohort study was initiated to investigate outcome, including mortality, in patients treated according to the Lund Concept after a sTBI covering 10-15 years post-trauma., METHODS: Patients were included during 2000-2004 when admitted to the neurointensive care unit, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were: Glasgow coma scale score of <=8, need for artificial ventilation and intracranial monitoring. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to evaluate outcome both at 1-year and 10-15 years post-trauma., RESULTS: Ninety-five patients, (27 female and 68 male), were initially included. Both improvement and deterioration were noted between 1- and 10-15 years post-injury. Mortality rate (34/95) was higher in the studied population vs. a matched Swedish population, (Standard mortality rate (SMR) 9.5; P < 0.0001). When dividing the cohort into Good (GOS 4-5) and Poor (GOS 2-3) outcome at 1-year, only patients with Poor outcome had a higher mortality rate than the matched population (SMR 7.3; P < 0.0001). Further, good outcome (high GOS) at 1-year was associated with high GOS 10-15 years post-trauma (P < 0.0001). Finally, a majority of patients demonstrated symptoms of mental fatigue., CONCLUSION: This indicates that patients with severe traumatic brain injury with Good outcome at 1-year have similar survival probability as a matched Swedish population and that high Glasgow outcome scale at 1-year is related to good long-term outcome.

Is It Reliable to Predict the Outcome of Elderly Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Using the IMPACT Prognostic Calculator?.,"Wan, Xueyan; Zhao, Kai; Wang, Sheng; Zhang, Huaqiu; Zeng, Liang; Wang, Yu; Han, Lin; Beejadhursing, Rajluxmee; Shu, Kai; Lei, Ting","BACKGROUND: Many investigators endeavor to predict the outcome based on admission characteristics using some established models to determine which management should be applied. However, the efficacy and applicability of the models using in the geriatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not yet been evaluated., METHODS: A total of 137 geriatric severe TBI patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the efficacy and usability of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model in evaluating the prognosis for these patients., RESULTS: The observed mortality and unfavorable outcomes at 6 months in patients with severe TBI were 54.7% and 70.8%, respectively, slightly lower than the predicted outcomes using the IMPACT model. ROC curve analysis showed areas under the curve (AUCs) for mortality of 0.76 and for unfavorable outcome of 0.80 in the Core model, of 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, in the Extended model, and of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively, in the Lab model. When expected risk of fatal outcome was >90% in any model, the true positive rate was 100%. Moreover, when the predicted risk for unfavorable outcomes was >70% in any model, the actual rate of unfavorable outcomes was >80%., CONCLUSIONS: The IMPACT prognosis calculator showed just fair discrimination when predicting the outcome of the elderly patients with severe TBI. Management decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis rather than by relying on the predicted risks identified by this model; conservative treatment might be preferable when expected risk of fatal outcome is >90%.

Perfusion Abnormalities are Frequently Detected by Early CT Perfusion and Predict Unfavourable Outcome Following Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Bendinelli, Cino; Cooper, Shannon; Evans, Tiffany; Bivard, Andrew; Pacey, Dianne; Parson, Mark; Balogh, Zsolt J","BACKGROUND: In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), early CT perfusion (CTP) provides additional information beyond the non-contrast CT (NCCT) and may alter clinical management. We hypothesized that this information may prognosticate functional outcome., METHODS: Five-year prospective observational study was performed in a level-1 trauma centre on consecutive severe TBI patients. CTP (obtained in conjunction with first routine NCCT) was interpreted as: abnormal, area of altered perfusion more extensive than on NCCT, and the presence of ischaemia. Six months Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended of four or less was considered an unfavourable outcome. Logistic regression analysis of CTP findings and core variables [preintubation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Rotterdam score, base deficit, age] was conducted using Bayesian model averaging to identify the best predicting model for unfavourable outcome., RESULTS: Fifty patients were investigated with CTP (one excluded for the absence of TBI) [male: 80%, median age: 35 (23-55), prehospital intubation: 7 (14.2%); median GCS: 5 (3-7); median injury severity score: 29 (20-36); median head and neck abbreviated injury scale: 4 (4-5); median days in ICU: 10 (5-15)]. Thirty (50.8%) patients had an unfavourable outcome. GCS was a moderate predictor of unfavourable outcome (AUC = 0.74), while CTP variables showed greater predictive ability (AUC for abnormal CTP = 0.92; AUC for area of altered perfusion more extensive than NCCT = 0.83; AUC for the presence of ischaemia = 0.81)., CONCLUSION: Following severe TBI, CTP performed at the time of the first follow-up NCCT, is a non-invasive and extremely valuable tool for early outcome prediction.

Revisiting Grade 3 Diffuse Axonal Injury: Not All Brainstem Microbleeds are Prognostically Equal.,"Izzy, Saef; Mazwi, Nicole L; Martinez, Sergi; Spencer, Camille A; Klein, Joshua P; Parikh, Gunjan; Glenn, Mel B; Greenberg, Steven M; Greer, David M; Wu, Ona; Edlow, Brian L","BACKGROUND: Recovery of functional independence is possible in patients with brainstem traumatic axonal injury (TAI), also referred to as ""grade 3 diffuse axonal injury,"" but acute prognostic biomarkers are lacking. We hypothesized that the extent of dorsal brainstem TAI measured by burden of traumatic microbleeds (TMBs) correlates with 1-year functional outcome more strongly than does ventral brainstem, corpus callosal, or global brain TMB burden. Further, we hypothesized that TMBs within brainstem nuclei of the ascending arousal network (AAN) correlate with 1-year outcome., METHODS: Using a prospective outcome database of patients treated for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury at an inpatient rehabilitation hospital, we retrospectively identified 39 patients who underwent acute gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TMBs were counted on the acute GRE scans globally and in the dorsal brainstem, ventral brainstem, and corpus callosum. TMBs were also mapped onto an atlas of AAN nuclei. The primary outcome was the disability rating scale (DRS) score at 1 year post-injury. Associations between regional TMBs, AAN TMB volume, and 1-year DRS score were assessed by calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficients., RESULTS: Mean +/- SD number of TMBs was: dorsal brainstem = 0.7 +/- 1.4, ventral brainstem = 0.2 +/- 0.6, corpus callosum = 1.8 +/- 2.8, and global = 14.4 +/- 12.5. The mean +/- SD TMB volume within AAN nuclei was 6.1 +/- 18.7 mm3. Increased dorsal brainstem TMBs and larger AAN TMB volume correlated with worse 1-year outcomes (R = 0.37, p = 0.02, and R = 0.36, p = 0.02, respectively). Global, callosal, and ventral brainstem TMBs did not correlate with outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dorsal brainstem TAI, especially involving AAN nuclei, may have greater prognostic utility than the total number of lesions in the brain or brainstem.",2017,/,Neurocritical care,27,2,199-207,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-017-0399-2,28477152,#6168,Izzy 2017,,yes
